"To take great managing from theory to practice, the author says, you must know three things about a person: her strengths, the triggers that activate those strengths, and how she learns. By asking the right questions, squeezing the right triggers, and becoming aware of your employees’ learning styles, you will discover what motivates each person to excel.

Capitalizing on a person’s uniqueness also builds a stronger sense of team. By taking the time to understand what makes each employee tick, a great manager shows that he sees his people for who they are. This personal investment not only motivates individuals but also galvanizes the entire team.

This focus on individuals also makes employees more accountable. Because staffers are evaluated on their particular strengths and weaknesses, they are challenged to take responsibility for their abilities and to hone them.

Such a specialized approach may seem like a lot of work. But in fact, capitalizing on each person’s uniqueness can save time. Rather than encourage employees to conform to strict job descriptions that may include tasks they don’t enjoy and aren’t good at, a manager who develops positions for his staff members based on their unique abilities will be rewarded with behaviors that are far more efficient and effective than they would be otherwise.

Much has been written about the qualities that make a great manager, but most of the literature overlooks a fundamental question: What does a great manager actually do? While there are countless management styles, one thing underpins the behavior of all great managers. Above all, an exceptional manager comes to know and value the particular quirks and abilities of her employees. She figures out how to capitalize on her staffers’ strengths and tweaks her environment to meet her larger goals.

“The best boss I ever had.” That’s a phrase most of us have said or heard at some point, but what does it mean? What sets the great boss apart from the average boss? The literature is rife with provocative writing about the qualities of managers and leaders and whether the two differ, but little has been said about what happens in the thousands of daily interactions and decisions that allows managers to get the best out of their people and win their devotion. What do great managers actually do?

In my research, beginning with a survey of 80,000 managers conducted by the Gallup Organization and continuing during the past two years with in-depth studies of a few top performers, I’ve found that while there are as many styles of management as there are managers, there is one quality that sets truly great managers apart from the rest: They discover what is unique about each person and then capitalize on it. Average managers play checkers, while great managers play chess. The difference? In checkers, all the pieces are uniform and move in the same way; they are interchangeable. You need to plan and coordinate their movements, certainly, but they all move at the same pace, on parallel paths. In chess, each type of piece moves in a different way, and you can’t play if you don’t know how each piece moves. More important, you won’t win if you don’t think carefully about how you move the pieces. Great managers know and value the unique abilities and even the eccentricities of their employees, and they learn how best to integrate them into a coordinated plan of attack.

This is the exact opposite of what great leaders do. Great leaders discover what is universal and capitalize on it. Their job is to rally people toward a better future. Leaders can succeed in this only when they can cut through differences of race, sex, age, nationality, and personality and, using stories and celebrating heroes, tap into those very few needs we all share. The job of a manager, meanwhile, is to turn one person’s particular talent into performance. Managers will succeed only when they can identify and deploy the differences among people, challenging each employee to excel in his or her own way. This doesn’t mean a leader can’t be a manager or vice versa. But to excel at one or both, you must be aware of the very different skills each role requires.

What does the chess game look like in action? When I visited Michelle Miller, the manager who opened Walgreens’ 4,000th store, I found the wall of her back office papered with work schedules. Michelle’s store in Redondo Beach, California, employs people with sharply different skills and potentially disruptive differences in personality. A critical part of her job, therefore, is to put people into roles and shifts that will allow them to shine—and to avoid putting clashing personalities together. At the same time, she needs to find ways for individuals to grow.

There’s Jeffrey, for example, a “goth rocker” whose hair is shaved on one side and long enough on the other side to cover his face. Michelle almost didn’t hire him because he couldn’t quite look her in the eye during his interview, but he wanted the hard-to-cover night shift, so she decided to give him a chance. After a couple of months, she noticed that when she gave Jeffrey a vague assignment, such as “Straighten up the merchandise in every aisle,” what should have been a two-hour job would take him all night—and wouldn’t be done very well. But if she gave him a more specific task, such as “Put up all the risers for Christmas,” all the risers would be symmetrical, with the right merchandise on each one, perfectly priced, labeled, and “faced” (turned toward the customer). Give Jeffrey a generic task, and he would struggle. Give him one that forced him to be accurate and analytical, and he would excel. This, Michelle concluded, was Jeffrey’s forte. So, as any good manager would do, she told him what she had deduced about him and praised him for his good work.

And a good manager would have left it at that. But Michelle knew she could get more out Jeffrey. So she devised a scheme to reassign responsibilities across the entire store to capitalize on his unique strengths. In every Walgreens, there is a responsibility called “resets and revisions.” A reset involves stocking an aisle with new merchandise, a task that usually coincides with a predictable change in customer buying patterns (at the end of summer, for example, the stores will replace sun creams and lip balms with allergy medicines). A revision is a less time-consuming but more frequent version of the same thing: Replace these cartons of toothpaste with this new and improved variety. Display this new line of detergent at this end of the row. Each aisle requires some form of revision at least once a week.

In most Walgreens stores, each employee “owns” one aisle, where she is responsible not only for serving customers but also for facing the merchandise, keeping the aisle clean and orderly, tagging items with a Telxon gun, and conducting all resets and revisions. This arrangement is simple and efficient, and it affords each employee a sense of personal responsibility. But Michelle decided that since Jeffrey was so good at resets and revisions—and didn’t enjoy interacting with customers—this should be his full-time job, in every single aisle.

It was a challenge. One week’s worth of revisions requires a binder three inches thick. But Michelle reasoned that not only would Jeffrey be excited by the challenge and get better and better with practice, but other employees would be freed from what they considered a chore and have more time to greet and serve customers. The store’s performance proved her right. After the reorganization, Michelle saw not only increases in sales and profit but also in that most critical performance metric, customer satisfaction. In the subsequent four months, her store netted perfect scores in Walgreens’ mystery shopper program.

So far, so very good. Sadly, it didn’t last. This “perfect” arrangement depended on Jeffrey remaining content, and he didn’t. With his success at doing resets and revisions, his confidence grew, and six months into the job, he wanted to move into management. Michelle wasn’t disappointed by this, however; she was intrigued. She had watched Jeffrey’s progress closely and had already decided that he might do well as a manager, though he wouldn’t be a particularly emotive one. Besides, like any good chess player, she had been thinking a couple of moves ahead.

Over in the cosmetics aisle worked an employee named Genoa. Michelle saw Genoa as something of a double threat. Not only was she adept at putting customers at ease—she remembered their names, asked good questions, was welcoming yet professional when answering the phone—but she was also a neatnik. The cosmetics department was always perfectly faced, every product remained aligned, and everything was arranged just so. Her aisle was sexy: It made you want to reach out and touch the merchandise.

To capitalize on these twin talents, and to accommodate Jeffrey’s desire for promotion, Michelle shuffled the roles within the store once again. She split Jeffrey’s reset and revision job in two and gave the “revision” part of it to Genoa so that the whole store could now benefit from her ability to arrange merchandise attractively. But Michelle didn’t want the store to miss out on Genoa’s gift for customer service, so Michelle asked her to focus on the revision role only between 8:30 am and 11:30 am, and after that, when the store began to fill with customers on their lunch breaks, Genoa should shift her focus over to them.

She kept the reset role with Jeffrey. Assistant managers don’t usually have an ongoing responsibility in the store, but, Michelle reasoned, he was now so good and so fast at tearing an aisle apart and rebuilding it that he could easily finish a major reset during a five-hour stint, so he could handle resets along with his managerial responsibilities.

By the time you read this, the Jeffrey–Genoa configuration has probably outlived its usefulness, and Michelle has moved on to design other effective and inventive configurations. The ability to keep tweaking roles to capitalize on the uniqueness of each person is the essence of great management.

A manager’s approach to capitalizing on differences can vary tremendously from place to place. Walk into the back office at another Walgreens, this one in San Jose, California, managed by Jim Kawashima, and you won’t see a single work schedule. Instead, the walls are covered with sales figures and statistics, the best of them circled with red felt-tip pen, and dozens of photographs of sales contest winners, most featuring a customer service representative named Manjit.

Manjit outperforms her peers consistently. When I first heard about her, she had just won a competition in Walgreens’ suggestive selling program to sell the most units of Gillette deodorant in a month. The national average was 300; Manjit had sold 1,600. Disposable cameras, toothpaste, batteries—you name it, she could sell it. And Manjit won contest after contest despite working the graveyard shift, from 12:30 am to 8:30 am, during which she met significantly fewer customers than did her peers.

Manjit hadn’t always been such an exceptional performer. She became stunningly successful only when Jim, who has made a habit of resuscitating troubled stores, came on board. What did Jim do to initiate the change in Manjit? He quickly picked up on her idiosyncrasies and figured out how to translate them into outstanding performance. For example, back in India, Manjit was an athlete—a runner and a weight lifter—and had always thrilled to the challenge of measured performance. When I interviewed her, one of the first things out of her mouth was, “On Saturday, I sold 343 low-carb candy bars. On Sunday, I sold 367. Yesterday, 110, and today, 105.” I asked if she always knows how well she’s doing. “Oh yes,” she replied. “Every day I check Mr. K’s charts. Even on my day off, I make a point to come in and check my numbers.”

Manjit loves to win and revels in public recognition. Hence, Jim’s walls are covered with charts and figures, Manjit’s scores are always highlighted in red, and there are photos documenting her success. Another manager might have asked Manjit to curb her enthusiasm for the limelight and give someone else a chance. Jim found a way to capitalize on it.

But what about Jim’s other staff members? Instead of being resentful of Manjit’s public recognition, the other employees came to understand that Jim took the time to see them as individuals and evaluate them based on their personal strengths. They also knew that Manjit’s success spoke well of the entire store, so her success galvanized the team. In fact, before long, the pictures of Manjit began to include other employees from the store, too. After a few months, the San Jose location was ranked number one out of 4,000 in Walgreens’ suggestive selling program.

Think back to Michelle. Her creative choreography may sound like a last resort, an attempt to make the best of a bad hire. It’s not. Jeffrey and Genoa are not mediocre employees, and capitalizing on each person’s uniqueness is a tremendously powerful tool.

First, identifying and capitalizing on each person’s uniqueness saves time. No employee, however talented, is perfectly well-rounded. Michelle could have spent untold hours coaching Jeffrey and cajoling him into smiling at, making friends with, and remembering the names of customers, but she probably would have seen little result for her efforts. Her time was much better spent carving out a role that took advantage of Jeffrey’s natural abilities.

Second, capitalizing on uniqueness makes each person more accountable. Michelle didn’t just praise Jeffrey for his ability to execute specific assignments. She challenged him to make this ability the cornerstone of his contribution to the store, to take ownership for this ability, to practice it, and to refine it.

Third, capitalizing on what is unique about each person builds a stronger sense of team, because it creates interdependency. It helps people appreciate one anothers’ particular skills and learn that their coworkers can fill in where they are lacking. In short, it makes people need one another. The old cliché is that there’s no “I” in “team.” But as Michael Jordan once said, “There may be no ‘I’ in ‘team,’ but there is in ‘win.’”

Finally, when you capitalize on what is unique about each person, you introduce a healthy degree of disruption into your world. You shuffle existing hierarchies: If Jeffrey is in charge of all resets and revisions in the store, should he now command more or less respect than an assistant manager? You also shuffle existing assumptions about who is allowed to do what: If Jeffrey devises new methods of resetting an aisle, does he have to ask permission to try these out, or can he experiment on his own? And you shuffle existing beliefs about where the true expertise lies: If Genoa comes up with a way of arranging new merchandise that she thinks is more appealing than the method suggested by the “planogram” sent down from Walgreens headquarters, does her expertise trump the planners back at corporate? These questions will challenge Walgreens’ orthodoxies and thus will help the company become more inquisitive, more intelligent, more vital, and, despite its size, more able to duck and weave into the future.

All that said, the reason great managers focus on uniqueness isn’t just because it makes good business sense. They do it because they can’t help it. Like Shelley and Keats, the nineteenth-century Romantic poets, great managers are fascinated with individuality for its own sake. Fine shadings of personality, though they may be invisible to some and frustrating to others, are crystal clear to and highly valued by great managers. They could no more ignore these subtleties than ignore their own needs and desires. Figuring out what makes people tick is simply in their nature.

Although the Romantics were mesmerized by differences, at some point, managers need to rein in their inquisitiveness, gather up what they know about a person, and put the employee’s idiosyncrasies to use. To that end, there are three things you must know about someone to manage her well: her strengths, the triggers that activate those strengths, and how she learns.

What You Need to Know About Each of Your Direct Reports

It takes time and effort to gain a full appreciation of an employee’s strengths and weaknesses. The great manager spends a good deal of time outside the office walking around, watching each person’s reactions to events, listening, and taking mental notes about what each individual is drawn to and what each person struggles with. There’s no substitute for this kind of observation, but you can obtain a lot of information about a person by asking a few simple, open-ended questions and listening carefully to the answers. Two queries in particular have proven most revealing when it comes to identifying strengths and weaknesses, and I recommend asking them of all new hires—and revisiting the questions periodically.

To identify a person’s strengths, first ask, “What was the best day at work you’ve had in the past three months?” Find out what the person was doing and why he enjoyed it so much. Remember: A strength is not merely something you are good at. In fact, it might be something you aren’t good at yet. It might be just a predilection, something you find so intrinsically satisfying that you look forward to doing it again and again and getting better at it over time. This question will prompt your employee to start thinking about his interests and abilities from this perspective.

To identify a person’s weaknesses, just invert the question: “What was the worst day you’ve had at work in the past three months?” And then probe for details about what he was doing and why it grated on him so much. As with a strength, a weakness is not merely something you are bad at (in fact, you might be quite competent at it). It is something that drains you of energy, an activity that you never look forward to doing and that when you are doing it, all you can think about is stopping.

Although you’re keeping an eye out for both the strengths and weaknesses of your employees, your focus should be on their strengths. Conventional wisdom holds that self-awareness is a good thing and that it’s the job of the manager to identify weaknesses and create a plan for overcoming them. But research by Albert Bandura, the father of social learning theory, has shown that self-assurance (labeled “self-efficacy” by cognitive psychologists), not self-awareness, is the strongest predictor of a person’s ability to set high goals, to persist in the face of obstacles, to bounce back when reversals occur, and, ultimately, to achieve the goals they set. By contrast, self-awareness has not been shown to be a predictor of any of these outcomes, and in some cases, it appears to retard them.

Great managers seem to understand this instinctively. They know that their job is not to arm each employee with a dispassionately accurate understanding of the limits of her strengths and the liabilities of her weaknesses but to reinforce her self-assurance. That’s why great managers focus on strengths. When a person succeeds, the great manager doesn’t praise her hard work. Even if there’s some exaggeration in the statement, he tells her that she succeeded because she has become so good at deploying her specific strengths. This, the manager knows, will strengthen the employee’s self-assurance and make her more optimistic and more resilient in the face of challenges to come.

The focus-on-strengths approach might create in the employee a modicum of overconfidence, but great managers mitigate this by emphasizing the size and the difficulty of the employee’s goals. They know that their primary objective is to create in each employee a specific state of mind: one that includes a realistic assessment of the difficulty of the obstacle ahead but an unrealistically optimistic belief in her ability to overcome it.

And what if the employee fails? Assuming the failure is not attributable to factors beyond her control, always explain failure as a lack of effort, even if this is only partially accurate. This will obscure self-doubt and give her something to work on as she faces up to the next challenge.

Repeated failure, of course, may indicate weakness where a role requires strength. In such cases, there are four approaches for overcoming weaknesses. If the problem amounts to a lack of skill or knowledge, that’s easy to solve: Simply offer the relevant training, allow some time for the employee to incorporate the new skills, and look for signs of improvement. If her performance doesn’t get better, you’ll know that the reason she’s struggling is because she is missing certain talents, a deficit no amount of skill or knowledge training is likely to fix. You’ll have to find a way to manage around this weakness and neutralize it.

Which brings us to the second strategy for overcoming an employee weakness. Can you find her a partner, someone whose talents are strong in precisely the areas where hers are weak? Here’s how this strategy can look in action. As vice president of merchandising for the women’s clothing retailer Ann Taylor, Judi Langley found that tensions were rising between her and one of her merchandising managers, Claudia (not her real name), whose analytical mind and intense nature created an overpowering “need to know.” If Claudia learned of something before Judi had a chance to review it with her, she would become deeply frustrated. Given the speed with which decisions were made, and given Judi’s busy schedule, this happened frequently. Judi was concerned that Claudia’s irritation was unsettling the whole product team, not to mention earning the employee a reputation as a malcontent.

An average manager might have identified this behavior as a weakness and lectured Claudia on how to control her need for information. Judi, however, realized that this “weakness” was an aspect of Claudia’s greatest strength: her analytical mind. Claudia would never be able to rein it in, at least not for long. So Judi looked for a strategy that would honor and support Claudia’s need to know, while channeling it more productively. Judi decided to act as Claudia’s information partner, and she committed to leaving Claudia a voice mail at the end of each day with a brief update. To make sure nothing fell through the cracks, they set up two live “touch base” conversations per week. This solution managed Claudia’s expectations and assured her that she would get the information she needed, if not exactly when she wanted it, then at least at frequent and predictable intervals. Giving Claudia a partner neutralized the negative manifestations of her strength, allowing her to focus her analytical mind on her work. (Of course, in most cases, the partner would need to be someone other than a manager.)

Should the perfect partner prove hard to find, try this third strategy: Insert into the employee’s world a technique that helps accomplish through discipline what the person can’t accomplish through instinct. I met one very successful screenwriter and director who had struggled with telling other professionals, such as composers and directors of photography, that their work was not up to snuff. So he devised a mental trick: He now imagines what the “god of art” would want and uses this imaginary entity as a source of strength. In his mind, he no longer imposes his own opinion on his colleagues but rather tells himself (and them) that an authoritative third party has weighed in.

If training produces no improvement, if complementary partnering proves impractical, and if no nifty discipline technique can be found, you are going to have to try the fourth and final strategy, which is to rearrange the employee’s working world to render his weakness irrelevant, as Michelle Miller did with Jeffrey. This strategy will require of you, first, the creativity to envision a more effective arrangement and, second, the courage to make that arrangement work. But as Michelle’s experience revealed, the payoff that may come in the form of increased employee productivity and engagement is well worth it.

A person’s strengths aren’t always on display. Sometimes they require precise triggering to turn them on. Squeeze the right trigger, and a person will push himself harder and persevere in the face of resistance. Squeeze the wrong one, and the person may well shut down. This can be tricky because triggers come in myriad and mysterious forms. One employee’s trigger might be tied to the time of day (he is a night owl, and his strengths only kick in after 3 pm). Another employee’s trigger might be tied to time with you, the boss (even though he’s worked with you for more than five years, he still needs you to check in with him every day, or he feels he’s being ignored). Another worker’s trigger might be just the opposite—independence (she’s only worked for you for six months, but if you check in with her even once a week, she feels micromanaged).

The most powerful trigger by far is recognition, not money. If you’re not convinced of this, start ignoring one of your highly paid stars, and watch what happens. Most managers are aware that employees respond well to recognition. Great managers refine and extend this insight. They realize that each employee plays to a slightly different audience. To excel as a manager, you must be able to match the employee to the audience he values most. One employee’s audience might be his peers; the best way to praise him would be to stand him up in front of his coworkers and publicly celebrate his achievement. Another’s favorite audience might be you; the most powerful recognition would be a one-on-one conversation where you tell him quietly but vividly why he is such a valuable member of the team. Still another employee might define himself by his expertise; his most prized form of recognition would be some type of professional or technical award. Yet another might value feedback only from customers, in which case a picture of the employee with her best customer or a letter to her from the customer would be the best form of recognition.

Given how much personal attention it requires, tailoring praise to fit the person is mostly a manager’s responsibility. But organizations can take a cue from this, too. There’s no reason why a large company can’t take this individualized approach to recognition and apply it to every employee. Of all the companies I’ve encountered, the North American division of HSBC, a London-based bank, has done the best job of this. Each year it presents its top individual consumer-lending performers with its Dream Awards. Each winner receives a unique prize. During the year, managers ask employees to identify what they would like to receive should they win. The prize value is capped at $10,000, and it cannot be redeemed as cash, but beyond those two restrictions, each employee is free to pick the prize he wants. At the end of the year, the company holds a Dream Awards gala, during which it shows a video about the winning employee and why he selected his particular prize.

You can imagine the impact these personalized prizes have on HSBC employees. It’s one thing to be brought up on stage and given yet another plaque. It’s another thing when, in addition to public recognition of your performance, you receive a college tuition fund for your child, or the Harley-Davidson motorcycle you’ve always dreamed of, or—the prize everyone at the company still talks about—the airline tickets to fly you and your family back to Mexico to visit the grandmother you haven’t seen in ten years.

Although there are many learning styles, a careful review of adult learning theory reveals that three styles predominate. These three are not mutually exclusive; certain employees may rely on a combination of two or perhaps all three. Nonetheless, staying attuned to each employee’s style or styles will help focus your coaching.

First, there’s analyzing. Claudia from Ann Taylor is an analyzer. She understands a task by taking it apart, examining its elements, and reconstructing it piece by piece. Because every single component of a task is important in her eyes, she craves information. She needs to absorb all there is to know about a subject before she can begin to feel comfortable with it. If she doesn’t feel she has enough information, she will dig and push until she gets it. She will read the assigned reading. She will attend the required classes. She will take good notes. She will study. And she will still want more.

The best way to teach an analyzer is to give her ample time in the classroom. Role-play with her. Do postmortem exercises with her. Break her performance down into its component parts so she can carefully build it back up. Always allow her time to prepare. The analyzer hates mistakes. A commonly held view is that mistakes fuel learning, but for the analyzer, this just isn’t true. In fact, the reason she prepares so diligently is to minimize the possibility of mistakes. So don’t expect to teach her much by throwing her into a new situation and telling her to wing it.

The opposite is true for the second dominant learning style, doing. While the most powerful learning moments for the analyzer occur prior to the performance, the doer’s most powerful moments occur during the performance. Trial and error are integral to this learning process. Jeffrey, from Michelle Miller’s store, is a doer. He learns the most while he’s in the act of figuring things out for himself. For him, preparation is a dry, uninspiring activity. So rather than role-play with someone like Jeffrey, pick a specific task within his role that is simple but real, give him a brief overview of the outcomes you want, and get out of his way. Then gradually increase the degree of each task’s complexity until he has mastered every aspect of his role. He may make a few mistakes along the way, but for the doer, mistakes are the raw material for learning.

Finally, there’s watching. Watchers won’t learn much through role-playing. They won’t learn by doing, either. Since most formal training programs incorporate both of these elements, watchers are often viewed as rather poor students. That may be true, but they aren’t necessarily poor learners.

Watchers can learn a great deal when they are given the chance to see the total performance. Studying the individual parts of a task is about as meaningful for them as studying the individual pixels of a digital photograph. What’s important for this type of learner is the content of each pixel, its position relative to all the others. Watchers are only able to see this when they view the complete picture.

As it happens, this is the way I learn. Years ago, when I first began interviewing, I struggled to learn the skill of creating a report on a person after I had interviewed him. I understood all the required steps, but I couldn’t seem to put them together. Some of my colleagues could knock out a report in an hour; for me, it would take the better part of a day. Then one afternoon, as I was staring morosely into my Dictaphone, I overheard the voice of the analyst next door. He was talking so rapidly that I initially thought he was on the phone. Only after a few minutes did I realize that he was dictating a report. This was the first time I had heard someone “in the act.” I’d seen the finished results countless times, since reading the reports of others was the way we were supposed to learn, but I’d never actually heard another analyst in the act of creation. It was a revelation. I finally saw how everything should come together into a coherent whole. I remember picking up my Dictaphone, mimicking the cadence and even the accent of my neighbor, and feeling the words begin to flow.

If you’re trying to teach a watcher, by far the most effective technique is to get her out of the classroom. Take her away from the manuals, and make her ride shotgun with one of your most experienced performers.• • •

We’ve seen, in the stories of great managers like Michelle Miller and Judi Langley, that at the very heart of their success lies an appreciation for individuality. This is not to say that managers don’t need other skills. They need to be able to hire well, to set expectations, and to interact productively with their own bosses, just to name a few. But what they do—instinctively—is play chess. Mediocre managers assume (or hope) that their employees will all be motivated by the same things and driven by the same goals, that they will desire the same kinds of relationships and learn in roughly the same way. They define the behaviors they expect from people and tell them to work on behaviors that don’t come naturally. They praise those who can overcome their natural styles to conform to preset ideas. In short, they believe the manager’s job is to mold, or transform, each employee into the perfect version of the role.

Great managers don’t try to change a person’s style. They never try to push a knight to move in the same way as a bishop. They know that their employees will differ in how they think, how they build relationships, how altruistic they are, how patient they can be, how much of an expert they need to be, how prepared they need to feel, what drives them, what challenges them, and what their goals are. These differences of trait and talent are like blood types: They cut across the superficial variations of race, sex, and age and capture the essential uniqueness of each individual.

Like blood types, the majority of these differences are enduring and resistant to change. A manager’s most precious resource is time, and great managers know that the most effective way to invest their time is to identify exactly how each employee is different and then to figure out how best to incorporate those enduring idiosyncrasies into the overall plan.

To excel at managing others, you must bring that insight to your actions and interactions. Always remember that great managing is about release, not transformation. It’s about constantly tweaking your environment so that the unique contribution, the unique needs, and the unique style of each employee can be given free rein. Your success as a manager will depend almost entirely on your ability to do this.",coaching
"When you wake up in the morning, what is the passion that fuels you to start your day?  Are you living this in your work?   If others asked you what drives you to achieve, would the answer be obvious?   The triggers that motivate people to achieve are unique for everyone.  Many would say its money; more people are starting to claim that they are driven to make a difference.  Regardless of what motivates you and drives you to reach peak performance - it must be managed and balanced.  Too much motivation in one area will weaken other parts of your game.

Motivation has been studied for decades and leaders in the workplace have used assessments like DISC and Myers-Briggs to determine their employee’s personality types to better anticipate behaviors and tendencies.   Additionally, motivational books are used as tools to get employees to increase their performance and / or get them back on track.    While assessments, books and other tools can help project and inspire short and long performance, the factors that motivate employees to achieve evolve as they mature and begin to truly understand what matters most to them.  Therefore, as leaders we must hold ourselves accountable to build meaningful and purposeful relationships that matter with our employees.  This allows us to better understand those we are serving, just as much as ourselves.

As a leader, don’t just read the assessment scores, get to know those whom you are leading and be specific about how you help each of them achieve their goals, desires and aspirations.   The objective should be to help one another and to accomplish this each of you must identify those things that motivate you both to work together.

To help you get the most from your employee relationships, here are the nine (9) things that ultimately motivate employees to achieve.  As you read this, think of how you associate with each of them.  Share your story and perspectives – and comment about it.  This is a hot topic and the more we can discuss it, we can help one another become better leaders.

Leaders that have your back and that are looking out for your best interests – will win the trust of their employees who in turn will be more motivated to achieve.    I once had a department manager that always looked out for me.  He was upfront in communicating his performance expectations and his feedback was direct.   He never treated me like a subordinate and looked for ways to include me in senior management meetings.  This opened my eyes to what lied ahead in my career and thus motivated me to reach the next level and in the process exceed the expectations of my boss.

Trust is a powerful motivational tool and those leaders that are more transparent with their employees will find surprising results and new types of opportunities to develop talent.

In today’s world where everyone wants to be noticed and recognized for their work - employees are motivated to achieve to remain relevant.   As such, employees are in search of new ways to learn, improve their skills and invest in themselves.   This is an opportunity for leaders to get involved and understand how to build the depth and breadth of their employee’s skill sets and aptitudes.  For example, find ways to elevate your employees’ high-potential status.

Helping employees increase their relevancy is important and those leaders that participate in this process will help cultivate increased performance levels and loyalty.  Helping your employees get discovered will elevate their motivation to achieve.

This particular motivation to achieve has been heighten as of late from younger professionals that seek to prove themselves faster amongst older generations in the workplace.   Employees never want to be stereotyped or marginalized, but for many younger professionals this serves as the trigger to awaken them from within.  This certainly is not a generational issue as many of us have been questioned about our ability to achieve at a high-level.  I learned this the hard way throughout my career.   For example, as a former C-level executive (in my early 30’s) and later as a successful entrepreneur - people begin to envy and / or doubt me thus igniting my hunger and drive to over achieve.

As a leader, encourage your employees to exceed expectations by taking responsible risks.  Embrace diverse thinking and measure one’s ability to innovate.  Never underestimate an employee’s ability to perform until you have properly evaluated and tested their abilities and potential.

Perhaps the most important factor on this list is the ability to advance.   Employees are extremely motivated to achieve if this means that advancement awaits them.   This requires employees to be mindful of opportunities that lie around, beneath and beyond what they seek.  As leaders, you will sustain high levels of motivation from your employees if you can open doors of opportunity and accelerate their chances for advancement.  Remember, just because your employees may be relevant, it doesn’t guarantee advancement.  So make it a point to help them get there.

How proficient are you at seeing and seizing opportunity?  If you haven’t taken my assessment, I suggest that you do (click here).   Over 200,000 people have taken it and less than 1% of them have ever scored over 35.

People only have a few real chances in their careers to reach their ultimate goals.   In fact, how many times do you meet people that are more successful than you are and you wonder how they got there.   People don’t want to live with any regrets in their career/life and thus are motivated to not disappoint themselves.

As a leader, don’t allow your employees to walk around carrying a load of guilt.  Share your journey with them – your failures and successes.   An employee that doesn’t believe will never achieve.    Help your employees embrace the unexpected and help them navigate uncertainty and change.   Many people are confused in today’s workplace about their future.  Motivate them by giving them the perspectives they need to achieve.

People are motivated to have safety and security.  Everyone wants a stable future, but you never know when time will pass you by.  That’s why we are all in a race against time and thus motivated to achieve faster than ever before.   We have all learned from the 2008 economic collapse that we can all quickly become victims of unexpected change without preparation.

As a leader, be mindful of providing security and stability in how you lead your employees – and watch their motivational levels rise.

This factor is quite interesting and extremely important to put into proper perspective.   People are motivated for selfish reasons to achieve – albeit money, attention, fame, etc.    Must we be reminded that greed and selfishness contributed greatly to America’s current economic hardship?

Motivation that satisfies our self-indulgence is can also be risky.   In reminds me of a great quote from Peter Drucker in his book, “The Effective Executive” when he says that every time you meet a person with great strengths, you are also meeting someone with great weaknesses.

As a leader, be aware that of your employees motivations are balance and well intentioned.   Self-indulgence can bring tremendous short term benefits – with longer term repercussions.

As mentioned earlier on, today’s employees are motivated to achieve more than ever simply by the opportunity to create impact.    As employees reflect on their lives and careers – they want to contribute in ways that measure their achievements based upon the long-term benefits that the company they serve bears.

As a leader, allow your employees to have sustainable impact in the work they perform.  Allow them to make a mark toward significance.   Create the opportunity for their achievement to leave a long lasting legacy that rewards the organization they serve and for future generations to learn from.

In the end, happiness is one of the greatest motivations to achieve.  Happiness fuels ones self-esteem and gives people hope for a better tomorrow.   We are all victims of taking our work too seriously.   Step back and enjoy the journey.  Your motivation to achieve is ultimately based on earning a living that brings you tremendous joy and satisfaction.

As a leader, be aware of whether your employees are satisfied in their work and that you are deliberate in having this type conversation with them.  Never assume.   Employees will smile to save their jobs even if they aren’t content.   Assure your employees happiness shines and allow the previous eight motivational factors to influence the process organically.

"It’s common knowledge that helping employees set and reach goals is a critical part of every manager’s job. Employees want to see how their work contributes to larger corporate objectives, and setting the right targets makes this connection explicit for them, and for you, as their manager. Goal-setting is particularly important as a mechanism for providing ongoing and year-end feedback. By establishing and monitoring targets, you can give your employees real-time input on their performance while motivating them to achieve more.

What the Experts Say

 So, how involved should you be in helping employees establish and achieve their goals? Since failure to meet goals can have consequences for you, your employee, and your team, as well as the broader organization, you need to balance your involvement with the employee’s ownership over the process. Linda Hill, the Wallace Brett Donham Professor of Business Administration at the Harvard Business School and co-author of Being the Boss: The 3 Imperatives for Becoming a Great Leader, says “A manager’s job is to provide ‘supportive autonomy’ that’s appropriate to the person’s level of capability.” The key is to be hands-on while giving your people the room they need to succeed on their own. Here are some principles to follow as you navigate how to best support your people in reaching their objectives.

Connect employee goals to larger company goals

 For goals to be meaningful and effective in motivating employees, they must be tied to larger organizational ambitions. Employees who don’t understand the roles they play in company success are more likely to become disengaged. “Achieving goals is often about making tradeoffs when things don’t go as planned. [Employees] need to understand the bigger picture to make those tradeoffs when things go wrong,” says Hill. No matter what level the employee is at, he should be able to articulate exactly how his efforts feed into the broader company strategy.

Make sure goals are attainable but challenging 

 Since employees are ultimately responsible for reaching their goals, they need to have a strong voice in setting them. Ask your employee to draft goals that directly contribute to the organization’s mission. Once she’s suggested initial goals, discuss whether her targets are both realistic and challenging enough. “Stretch targets emerge as a process of negotiation between the employee and the manager,” says Srikant M. Datar, the Arthur Lowes Dickinson Professor of Accounting at Harvard University and contributor to the Goal Setting module of Harvard ManageMentor. Be careful though: your team members are likely to resent you if you insist on goals that are too challenging to accomplish. At the same time, you don’t want to aim too low, either. If you are overly cautious, you will miss opportunities and settle for mediocrity. “When done well, stretch goals create a lot of energy and momentum in an organization,” says Datar. But, when done badly, they “do not achieve the goal of motivating employees and helping them achieve better performance as they were designed to do,” he adds. Even worse, poorly set goals can be destructive to employees’ morale and productivity, and to the organization’s performance overall.

Create a plan for success

 Once a goal is set, ask your employee to explain how he plans to meet it. Have him break goals down into tasks and set interim objectives, especially if it’s a large or long-term project. Ask your employee: what are the appropriate milestones? What are possible risks and how do you plan to manage them? Because targets are rarely pursued in a vacuum, Hill suggests that you “help your people understand who they are dependent on to achieve those goals.” Then problem solve with them on how to best influence those people to get the job done.

Monitor progress

 Staying on top of employee progress will help head off any troubles early on. “We often get problems because we don’t signal that we are partners in achieving goals,” says Hill. Don’t wait for review time or the end of a project to check in. Review both long-term and short-term goals on a weekly basis. Even your high-performing employees need ongoing feedback and coaching. Ask your employee what type of monitoring and feedback would be most helpful to her, especially if the task is particularly challenging or something she is doing for the first time.

When things go wrong

 Very few of us reach our goals without some road bumps along the way. Build relationships with employees so that they feel comfortable coming to you if and when problems arise. If your employee encounters an unforeseen obstacle, the goal may need reworking. First, however, ask him to bring a potential solution to you so you can give him coaching and advice. If his efforts to solve the problem fail, you will need to get further involved.

What about personal goals?

 Some managers neglect to think about what an employee is personally trying to accomplish in the context of work. “If I account for the interests of the whole person, not just the work person, I’m going to get more value from them,” says Stewart D. Friedman, Practice Professor of Management at the Wharton School and author of Total Leadership: Be a Better Leader, Have a Richer Life. For example, if your employee has expressed an interest in teaching but that is not part of his job responsibilities, you may be able to find ways to sculpt his job to include opportunities to train peers or less experienced colleagues.

The first step is for you to understand what these goals are. Ask employees if they have any personal goals they want to share with you. Don’t pressure them; they should only share these aspirations if they feel comfortable. Friedman suggests you then ask, ‘What adjustments might we try that would help you achieve your goals?” This allows the employee to take ownership over the solution. Just as with work goals, you need to be sure personal goals contribute to your team, unit, or to the company. “It’s got to be a shared commitment to experiment and mutual responsibility to check in on how it’s going. It’s got to be a win for both,” says Friedman.

When goals aren’t met

 There will be times, even with the best support, when employees fail to meet their targets. “Hold people accountable. You can’t say ‘Gee, that’s too bad.’ You need to figure out what went wrong and why,” says Hill. Discuss with your employee what happened and what each of you think went wrong. If the problem was within his control, ask him to apply the possible solutions you’ve discussed, take another stab at reaching the goal, and check in with you more frequently. If it was something that was outside of his power or the goal was too ambitious, acknowledge the disappointment but don’t dwell on it. “Do the diagnosis, get the learning, and move on,” says Hill.

It’s possible that you may have contributed to the problem. Be willing to reflect on your role in the failure. Were you too hands off and failed to check in frequently enough? Did you not review his work in a timely way? Have an open discussion about what you can do next time. “If you don’t hold yourself accountable, they’re going to have trouble with you,” says Hill.

Case Study #1: Being a partner in goal attainment

 Meghan Lantier is known at Bliss PR for being a natural people developer. As the vice president of the firm’s financial services practice, Meghan manages several senior account executives, including Shauna Ellerson*. Meghan has overseen Shauna’s work since Shauna started at Bliss four and a half years ago. Since the beginning, they have set goals through a collaborative process: Shauna develops draft goals, Meghan comes up with ones she believes Shauna needs to focus on, and then they identify the overlap between them. “I want to make sure they are manageable but stretched too,” says Meghan. The two regularly check in on these goals. Meghan takes a hands-on approach, providing Shauna with regular input. They also sit down together at least four times a year to have a more formal discussion about Shauna’s ambitions.

One of Shauna’s goals is to become more of a thought leader on one of their largest financial services accounts. She has mastered the day-to-day work of managing the client and now needs to focus on the bigger picture. Shauna has been working on this goal for several months now by speaking up more in client meetings and providing more input into the content, not just the process, of their work. “We don’t need a goal review session. I give her constant feedback in the context of the work,” says Meghan.

Meghan also knows that ultimately Shauna is responsible for her own achievements. “I’m fully invested in making it work but I realized the limitations I have as a manager to make it happen,” she says. It hasn’t been necessary to talk about the consequences if Shauna fails to meet the goal — there are natural consequences in Bliss’s high-performing culture. If you don’t succeed, you don’t get the better assignments.

Case Study #2: Supporting personal goals

 Amy Werner took a job at the New York City-based search firm On-Ramps just over three years ago. Amy joined at an integral time in the firm’s growth and quickly became a key asset to the small firm. Sarah Grayson, one of the firm’s founding partners, manages Amy and explains, “Amy has a lot of institutional knowledge and is a high performer.” When she first began she was working toward a degree in social work but taking classes at nights and on the weekends. A year and a half into the job, Amy’s school schedule became more complicated. Her internship requirements made working a traditional, full-time schedule difficult. Because of her star performance, Sarah and her fellow partners were keen to keep her on board while encouraging her to complete her degree. Amy remained full time but now works two days a week in the office, completing the rest of her hours on nights and weekends. As Amy says, “They have been nothing but supportive.”

The firm has a semi-annual review process where goals are set and discussed; they also do more frequent check-ins on goals during weekly meetings. Amy and Sarah have talked a lot about how On-Ramps can support Amy not only by providing a flexible schedule but by thinking about the intersection of her studies and her work. They’ve found that there are lots of transferable skills between her job as a search associate and her work as a social worker, such as interviewing and client management. In explaining why they are so supportive of Amy’s educational activities, Sarah says, “We wouldn’t have done this for a low performer. We have to ask ourselves, ‘What would it take to hire another Amy?'” Amy will be finishing her master’s degree in May and she and Sarah have begun to discuss what’s next for her. Both hope that there is a way to combine her skills in search and her interest in social work to create a job that is ideal for both her and On-Ramps.

"We live in a society where hustle and achievement are coveted metrics for entrepreneurs. But what about effective time management along with recovery and restoration?

After all, the body, much like a vehicle, can only undergo so much usage until the light comes on signaling it's time to refuel. Unfortunately, there are a plethora of entrepreneurs who are disregarding this light and are running themselves into the ground (along with their productivity and time effectiveness).

It's no secret that one of the key factors to top performers' success is their ability to manage their time in an efficient and effective way, which, in turn, leads to them producing at higher levels.

One of those top performers is Jeff Bezos who recently shared his philosophy and keys to time management on a column reported by The Wall Street Journal. If you're looking to think and perform better, adopt this one rule.

When discussing his habits and routine, Bezos states: ""I go to bed early, I get up early, I like to putter in the morning, reading the newspaper, drinking a cup of coffee and eating breakfast with my children.""

As he expounded on his reasoning for this, Bezos stated ""His primary job each day as a senior executive is to make a small number of high-quality decisions. That means getting eight hours of sleep, too. ""I think better, I have more energy, my mood's better.""""

Lastly, Bezos schedules ""high IQ"" meetings before lunch (around 10 a.m.) and attempts to finish making tough decisions by 5 p.m while aiming to make three good decisions daily.

Sleep is important, but Bezos's philosophy described above is going one level deeper than people go when it comes to optimizing their performance. Bezos is aligning his circadian rhythm to what best serves his performance and lifestyle.

Think of sleep as nutrition for your brain. Your circadian rhythm is one of the biological processes that govern sleep in a 24-hour cycle. As you go through the day, you'll experience fluctuations in appetite, blood pressure, body temperature, concentration levels, and fatigue levels.

Optimizing your sleep and schedule lead to more energy, which increases your effectiveness and efficiency. There are certain times of the day where you'll be mentally sharper and these are the times that should be reserved for your toughest of challenges and obstacles.

A well-rested brain makes its best and highest-quality decisions before noon and will be generally tired by 5 p.m. It's tempting to burn the candle at both ends, but prioritizing rest will often times, lead to your biggest breakthroughs and advancements.",wellness
"I remember the conversations well because we had several of them. They were always very similar. They went like this.

A good friend of mine who knows of my longstanding interest in the practice of management would tell me how upset she was with her boss. I'd then ask, ""Well, what exactly is the problem?"" And she'd respond basically with variations of five sentiments.

""I have no idea how I'm doing.""

""It's not clear what's expected of me.""

""If I have questions, they don't get answered.""

""If I try to talk to him, he's inaccessible.""

Oh, and there's also a sixth:

""He's driving me crazy. I'm anxious all the time. I can't continue to work this way.""

Over the years I've seen this sort of employee-manager scenario played out many times. The situations all have a common theme. If you distill the comments above to their essence, they can be boiled down to a single issue.

Fact: I never met a good manager who wasn't also a good communicator. But I met plenty of bad managers who weren't good communicators. Who didn't really like communicating. Who weren't comfortable with it. Who would avoid it if they could.

Noting that communication is a fundamental element of management may seem like I'm demonstrating a keen sense of the obvious. Fair enough. But just because something is obvious doesn't means it's regularly adhered to.

If there's one thing I've learned in my years in business it's that good managers are hard to find. And highly valuable to organizations. Stats show that some 60% of managers don't get the results that are expected in their first two years on the job.

Good managers are always comfortable communicating.  After all, it's a critical element of key management functions: providing feedback, offering recognition, taking corrective action — all part of establishing solid working relationships. Yet it's amazing how often this core characteristic is routinely ignored in favor of attributes like authority, technical prowess and executive presence.

Not to say such qualities aren't valuable — sure they are — but when they're not accompanied by a solid base of open thoughtful communication, it's a recipe for managerial problems.

Which is why I've always advised Human Resource professionals and hiring managers to be sure that prospective managers are good communicators. Communication is the lubricant that keeps the engine of management running smoothly.

When that engine breaks down and parts start to grind, you get disgruntled sentiments like the five noted by my friend above.

At which point costly, unwanted outcomes like disengagement and turnover are usually close behind.",communication
"B players can be selfless and dedicated employees, but they often don’t get the attention from managers they deserve. To retain and motivate your B’s, get to know and appreciate them as the unique individuals they are. This is the first step to drawing out their hidden strengths and skills. Reassess job fit to make sure they’re in roles that draw on those strengths. Make sure you’re not overlooking someone’s talents because they’re quiet or reserved, or because they don’t fit your mental model of what a “leader” should look like. And give them permission to lead. While A players don’t wait for permission, B’s often do — but they can be just as effective once they know they have your support.

We’ve heard for decades that we should only hire A players, and should even try to cut non-A players from our teams. But not only do the criteria for being an A player vary significantly by company, it’s unrealistic to think you can work only with A players. Further, as demonstrated by Google’s Aristotle project, a study of what makes teams effective, this preference for A players ignores the deep value that the people you may think of as B players actually provide.

As I’ve seen in companies of all sizes and industries, stars often struggle to adapt to the culture, and may not collaborate well with colleagues. B players, on the other hand, are often less concerned about their personal trajectories, and are more likely to go above and beyond in order to support customers, colleagues, and the reputation of the business. For example, when one of my clients went through a disastrous changeover from one enterprise resource planning system to another, it was someone perceived as a B player who kept all areas of the business informed as she took personal responsibility for ensuring that every transaction and customer communication was corrected.

How can you support your B players to be their best and contribute the most possible, rather than wishing they were A players? Consider these five approaches to stop underestimating your B players and help them to reach their potential.

Get to know and appreciate them as the unique individuals they are. This is the first step to drawing out their hidden strengths and skills. Learn about their personal concerns, preferences, and the way they see and go about their work. Be sure you’re not ignoring them because they’re introverts, remote workers, or don’t know how to be squeaky wheels. A senior leader I worked with had such a strong preference for extroverts that she ignored or downgraded team members who were just going about their business.

Meanwhile, the stars on her team got plenty of attention and resources, even though they often created drama and turmoil, rather than carrying their full share of responsibility for outcomes. Some of the team members she thought of as B players started turning over after long-term frustration. When the leader and some of her stars eventually left the company, some of the B’s came back and were able to make significant contributions because they supported the mission and understood the work processes.

Reassess job fit. Employees rarely do their best if they’re in jobs that highlight their weaknesses rather than their strengths. They may have technical experience but no interest, or they could be weak managers but strong individual contributors. One leader I know had been growing increasingly more frustrated and less effective; the pressures of satisfying the conflicting demands of different departments were too much for her. Then she took a lateral move to manage a smaller, more cohesive team focused on developing new products, and was able to focus and be inspirational again once she was freed from the pressures of managing projects in such a political environment.

Consider the possibility of bias in your assignments. Women and people of color are often overlooked for challenging or high-status assignments. They’re assumed “not to be ready,” or they’re not considered because they don’t act like commonly held but stereotyped views of “leaders.” When a midlevel leader who was trying to get more exposure and advancement for one of his team members couldn’t figure out what was holding her back in the eyes of the senior leader, I raised this possibility, and we strategized multiple ways that her boss could showcase the quality and impact of her work in upcoming meetings.

Intentionally support them to be their best. Some people are their own worst critics, or have deep-seated limiting beliefs that hold them back. When one of my clients lost a senior leader and couldn’t afford to replace her at market rates, a longtime B player near the end of his career nervously filled the gap. Although he expanded his duties and kept the team going, he emphasized to both his management and himself that he wasn’t really up to the job, and most of the executive team continued to treat him that way. It was not till after he had retired, and a new senior leader had to fill his shoes, that it became clear how much he had done on the organization’s behalf. The executive team never came to grips with how much more he could have accomplished had they provided the relevant development, support, and appreciation all along.

Give permission to take the lead. In 30 years of practice, one of the most common reasons I’ve seen people hold back is if they don’t believe they’ve been given permission to step up. (The people we think of as A’s tend not to ask for or wait for permission.) Some B players aren’t comfortable in the spotlight, but they thrive when they’re encouraged to complete a mission or to contribute for the good of the company. A midlevel leader I coach is quiet, modest, and doesn’t like to make waves. She kept waiting for her new leader to lay out a vision for the future and to provide direction about how the work should be done. I asked what she would do if she was suddenly in charge. She laid out a cogent plan, and I encouraged her to present it to the new leader and ask for permission to proceed. Now she and the senior leader are moving forward in partnership.

We can’t all be A players, and it’s unrealistic to think we’ll only ever work with A players. But that may not be the appropriate goal. Instead, try using these strategies to help employees give their best, and you’ll be ensuring that your whole team can turn in an A+ performance.",coaching
"It always amazes me how many people assume marketing is the magic bullet to increased sales and revenue for a business. While marketing is critical and the funnel to sales, it alone does not a sales strategy make. We often talk about the 3 to 5 touch points a brand needs to make from a marketing standpoint, but it's just as important to talk about what happens before and after the marketing team does its magic.

A pipeline is the feeder to all things sales. In fact, if you don't know how many people are in your pipeline currently, and what your conversion or close ratio is, you're probably one of the millions of businesses out there that's on the sales struggle bus.

Knowing your numbers in sales is like following a good recipe. When you know the ingredients, you'll know what's going to come out of the oven. But, if you forget a few components, you'll wind up with a tasteless, flat cake that no one wants to eat. It's the same thing in sales.

Developing a pipeline can and should come from both online and offline efforts. So step one should be determining your pipeline (sales) baseline. If you're starting from zero, this should be copied directly from your pro forma as a hypothesis to be tested.

Once you have your baseline, it's time to develop your sales funnel. A typical sales funnel looks like an inverted triangle. At the top of the triangle are visibility and awareness opportunities--think in-person events, social media, advertising, and content that drives that first point of contact with your company. At the bottom of the funnel are the big wins--that huge client or sale.

Good sales and marketing teams think not only about how to drive initial contact with a brand, but they also think about the customer journey and the graduated levels of service offerings, content, and calls to action that drive someone down through their sales funnel.

The best thing I can do is share with you our personal funnel at Elevate My Brand. At the top of our funnel, we have advertising, social media, referrals, speaking events, in-person networking, and content marketing. That's how people come into contact with our brand. Once they do that, we have several paths that engage them with our brand at the next stage of our funnel. For some, we immediately go into a consultation discovery call. For others, we offer our free marketing guide. Either way, it's important that the first level of the funnel is engaging and tantalizing. We call this the irresistible offer.

Once people go through the initial process and determine they have an interest in working with us, we bifurcate our customer journey. Some go directly to proposal mode (those are the clients with clear budgets and timelines) and others have an interim step of filling out our entry questionnaire. The detailed questionnaire not only allows us to hit the ground running and understand a brand on a deeper level, but it also shows us who is really serious about working with us and who isn't. That's the great thing about a successful sales funnel: It also weeds out those who aren't a good fit.

Once a client is determined to be ready and have the right budget and need, the next step of the funnel is hourly or project-based work. Some clients need to go in this direction because of budgetary limitations; others use it as a test to determine whether they want to develop a long-term relationship with the agency. At the bottom of our funnel is AOR, our agency of record model. This is where brands sign up for full-service experiential and digital support. That's where we are able to do our best work and best support our client brands.

Whether you're a service business or a scalable product, you have a unique sales funnel that you need to strategically develop based on your customer journey to drive visibility and awareness. When done right, that journey eventually turns into a conversion (a purchase or hiring decision). That's when the magic happens.",None
"Turning Negativity into Productivity

 Dealing with a pessimist on your team can be a frustrating and time-consuming experience. Attempts to ignore or counter frequent negative comments may simply incite further negativity. Good news: by being proactive you can help the pessimist change his behavior and enable your team to achieve greater productivity.

What the Experts Say

 The first step is to figure out what is causing your team member’s negativity. Roderick Kramer, William R. Kimball Professor of Organizational Behavior at Stanford Graduate School of Business, says that it is the role of the leader to understand the underlying cause of the pessimism before acting. “Some people are dispositional pessimists whose knee-jerk reaction is to see the negative in everything, while others may be expressing a pessimistic point of view based upon informed logic,” Kramer says. Some common sources of pessimism include resentment at not having been promoted, a need for attention, or a need to cover for a lack of knowledge or skill.

Whatever the source of the pessimism, the key to responding constructively is to focus on the impact of the individual’s behavior, according to Marshall Goldsmith, executive educator and the author of What Got You Here Won’t Get You There. Changing behavior is much easier than trying to reform a person’s long-held beliefs and values.

Here are three approaches to managing negative behavior:

1. Create awareness. This is best done by pulling the team member aside and explaining how his comments are received. The rule when giving this type of feedback, says Jon Katzenbach, author of Wisdom of Teams and founder of the Katzenbach Center at Booz & Co., is to “be at least as positive as you are negative.” Explain why the person is valued on the team and make clear the impact of his behavior. For example, you can say, “When you make negative comments, the team gets stuck and we aren’t able to move forward.” Kramer points out, “This kind of conversation can be useful from a diagnostic perspective.” Once you understand the underlying reason for the pessimism, you can provide additional support or information if it’s needed.

2. Reposition negative statements. Negativity can fester and eventually kill a team’s momentum and motivation. Don’t let negative comments linger. Ask for clarification or more information about what the speaker means. For example, if a team member says, “This project is never going to make it past Finance,” ask the speaker to explain why she thinks that. Better yet, you can ask for alternative solutions: “What can we do to make sure the project does make it past Finance?” You can also ask team members to use “but statements.” Ask them to follow skeptical or critical sentences with “but.” For example, your team member could say “This project is never going to make it past Finance, BUT it’s worth laying the groundwork now because next year, Finance is apt to approve more tech projects.” It’s helpful to model this type of behavior for the entire team. Offer your own constructive criticism while providing an alternative solution.

3. Involve the whole team. It can be damaging to single out a team member in front of the entire team. Peer pressure is a far more effective tactic. According to Kramer, “Sometimes social sanctions work better than leader sanctions.” Set team norms and ask everyone to observe them. Goldsmith suggests that individuals ask themselves before they speak, “Will this comment help our customers? Will this help our company? Will this help the person or team we’re talking about? Will this help the person we’re talking to?” As Goldsmith points out, “Honesty may be the best policy except when it’s destructive and unhelpful.” Once you’ve agreed on norms, ask the team to hold each other to them. This approach can be used when you’re not the team leader as well. If a fellow team member is regularly negative, you can appeal to what Kramer calls “the collective wisdom” of the team by modeling positive behavior and using peer pressure to show the pessimist a more productive way of contributing. Of course as a peer, your influence is limited and you may need to talk with the team leader if your attempts to redirect the pessimist don’t work.

When All Else Fails

 All of the experts agree that if a team member is continually disruptive and does not respond to coaching or feedback, you may ultimately need to remove her from the team. Sometimes people are not a good fit for a team or a project and it’s your job as leader to make that distinction.

Negativity Can be Useful

 It’s important to remember that the goal here is not to rid the team of any skeptical sentiment. Not all negativity is bad, despite how it sounds or feels. According to Kramer, habitual pessimists’ concerns may in some cases be well informed and rational and “based on an intuition or insight that could be extremely helpful to the group.” For example, there were pessimists at NASA who didn’t feel the Space Shuttle Columbia was ready, especially after the Challenger disaster seven years earlier. We need dissenting voices to check our assumptions and push our ideas. Katzenbach says, “An irritating member adds a dimension to teaming. As long as he or she is not strong enough to derail progress, he or she may offer thoughts that otherwise wouldn’t come in.”

Case Study #1: Turning Negative Comments into Constructive Ones

 Lisa Schneider, a sales director at an online media company, was leading a team to organize the company’s sales inventory and identify operational efficiencies in the way they leveraged the inventory in new sales. Many of the team members were not Lisa’s direct reports but people from other departments. Fred worked for Operations and from the beginning of the team’s work together was skeptical of the project. He said over and over, “This isn’t going to work.” Lisa could see that Fred’s attitude was having an effect on the other team members and was concerned he would ultimately impede the team’s progress. She pulled Fred aside and explained that whenever he made negative comments, the team looked deflated and the conversation stopped. Fred was receptive to what she had to say, but he believed that Operations would not be able to execute on the ideas they were putting forth. Lisa told Fred that his boss, the head of Operations, believed in this project and had asked him to join the team for a reason. She asked him to offer alternatives to the ideas being proposed in addition to raising concerns. “I explained to Fred that what he was doing felt like continually putting up roadblocks, without providing a detour sign. I asked that he propose additional solutions to overcome the obstacles he was raising,” Lisa said. He took Lisa’s advice to heart and began engaging with the team on new solutions. Team members were relieved to see Fred contributing in a positive way and openly debated the merits of the solutions he proposed.

Ultimately, the team’s recommendations were implemented with many of Fred’s alternative solutions incorporated. Lisa believes the end results were more rigorous because of Fred’s contributions. The project was considered a success and the new system has saved Operations 100 hours of work each quarter.

Case Study #2: Pessimism as Cover

 Rutger von Post, a Principal at Booz & Company, recently led a team with a difficult team member. Joe was a junior consultant reporting into Rutger on this particular client project. Joe continually expressed skepticism about how the team was sizing the market for a new healthcare product. The team met several times to go over the project, clearly divide up the work, and set goals and milestones. Joe did not productively contribute to any of these discussions. In fact, he would cross his arms and say things such as, “I don’t see how this is useful for the client.” Rutger pulled him aside in an attempt to understand what was causing Joe’s negativity. Only after Rutger gave him direct and stark feedback about his behavior and the impact on his performance, did Joe make clear that he was acting skeptical because he didn’t know how to do what was asked of him. Rutger spent a half day with Joe going over what he needed to do and practicing the work with him. Together they sized 5 of 30 sub-segments of the market so Joe would then be comfortable doing the rest of the work on his own. Rutger said, “Once he was shown how to do it his skepticism evaporated.” Joe eventually became a productive member of the team once Rutger understood and addressed the real source of his pessimism.

"Sometimes there’s so much going on in your life, and the broader world, that you can’t focus. What can you do when every time you sit down at your desk, you feel distracted? Start by understanding the impact distractions, like a constantly pinging phone or even a quick Twitter break, have on your brain. Multitasking doesn’t work and has high cognitive costs. When you find yourself distracted, use a simple breathing exercise to break the immediate cycle of anxiety and frustration. Acknowledge those feelings, but don’t get swept up in them. Think about how you want to act as a colleague and a leader and let that self-image guide your behavior. Be sure to set clear boundaries for yourself around when you’ll go on social media or check email. And be mindful of whom you spend time with. Because of social contagion, colleagues who are overwhelmed and distracted are likely to make you feel the same way. Try to make your relationships supportive: Ask coworkers for advice and commit to keeping each other on task. Finally, don’t neglect self-care. Take breaks, eat healthily, and get sleep.

Sometimes there’s so much going on in your life, and the world, that you can’t focus. What can you do when every time you sit down at your desk, you feel distracted? How can you get back to feeling focused and productive?

What the Experts Say

 Feeling distracted and unproductive is something most people struggle with, says Susan David, founder of the Harvard/McLean Institute of Coaching and author of Emotional Agility. Especially because most of us are constantly bombarded by news alerts, text messages, and other interruptions. And even on days when you might feel industrious, you have to contend with what’s going on with your coworkers. “We very subtly pick up on others’ behaviors and emotions,” David says. “When this happens, we can start to lose our way.” Rich Fernandez, CEO of the nonprofit Search Inside Yourself Leadership Institute, a global mindfulness and emotional intelligence training organization, notes that we’re actually wired this way. “One thing we all have in common is a fundamental neuroanatomy that orients us toward stress that isn’t always productive,” he explains. To overcome this and regain your focus, take the following steps.

Understand the dangers of multitasking

 Start by understanding the impact that distractions, like a constantly pinging phone or quick Twitter break, have on your brain. Fernandez explains that we have a network of brain structures related to focus. There’s the default mode network, which is responsible for analyzing the past, forecasting or planning for the future, and reflecting on oneself and others. “We’re in this mode at least half of the time,” he says. But when you need to focus your mind, you tap into the direct attention network, which allows you to put aside ruminations and stay on task. Distractions, in whatever form they take, pull you back into default mode, and the cognitive cost of regaining your focus is high. “Some research shows it can take 10–18 minutes to get the same level of attention back,” Fernandez says. This is why it’s critical to reduce interruptions.

Allow for your emotional response, but stay in charge

 Feeling overwhelmed can bring up a lot of emotions — frustration, anger, anxiety — that take a further toll on your productivity. So you have to “break the cycle,” David says. To “regain a sense of agency,” so you don’t feel “at the mercy of the events going on in the world or in your office,” label your feelings and then ask yourself questions about them. You might say, “OK, I’m feeling angry, but who’s in charge — the anger or me, the person having the emotion?” Fernandez agrees with this approach: “You want to acknowledge that these feelings are there — they’re legitimate and significant — but not get swept away by them.”

Gather your attention

 When you do find yourself distracted, “Pause, take stock, be aware that you’re being triggered,” Fernandez says. “Then switch the spotlight of your attention.” This might feel easier said than done, but remind yourself that most of the things we worry about “aren’t immediate existential threats.” To reconnect with the logical part of your brain, focus it on “something more immediate or visceral, like your breath.” You might say to yourself, “I’ve become consumed by this Twitter thread. I’m going to pay attention to my breathing” to pivot away from what’s causing the anxiety. Fernandez says this isn’t the same as trying to ignore the distraction: “You don’t have to stifle it or suppress it. Make note of it, acknowledge it, and put it in a mental parking lot to think about later, when you can discuss it with someone else, or when you’re not at work and have lots to do.”

Rely on your values

 Once you’ve gathered your attention, you can choose where to focus it. David says that concentrating on your values gives you a sense of control. “When you’re overwhelmed, it feels like a lot of power and choices are being taken away from you,” she says. “But you still get to choose who you want to be. If one of your core values is to be collaborative, focus on that. How can you help people feel like part of the team?” And consider how your lack of focus is affecting your sense of self. “If fairness is important to you, how is your distraction contributing to your ability to be fair? If you’re on Facebook for three hours a day, how fair is that to your team or your family?”

Put up boundaries

 Once you have more awareness about what distracts you, set rules for yourself. If you realize that checking news in the morning means that you’re upset and unfocused when you get to the office, tell yourself that you won’t catch up on world events until lunchtime. Or you can decide that you’re going to get a certain amount of work done before you go on Facebook. If you don’t have the self-control for this, there are apps you can install in your browsers or on your phone to control how much time you spend on particular sites. You also have to practice. “There’s a lot of research that suggests the difference between elite focus and non-elite focus is deliberate focus,” Fernandez says. He points to athletes who train by telling themselves, for example, “I’m not going to leave the free-throw line until I make 10 free throws.” So spend time training your brain to stay on task.

Choose whom you interact with wisely

 Social contagion is real. “We’ve all had that experience when you go into an elevator and everyone is looking at their cell phones, so you start looking at yours,” David says. She points to recent research that shows that if someone next to you on an airplane buys candy — even if you don’t know the person — you’re 30% more likely to make a similar purchase. The same goes for productivity. If you have colleagues who are constantly distracted themselves, or who tend to pull you away from work, try to spend less time with them. You don’t have to be rude; you can say something simple like, “Can we continue this conversation later? I want to get this report done and then I can take a break.”

Give and get support from your colleagues

 Instead of avoiding your distracted colleagues, you could try to encourage each other to stay focused. Make a pact with your coworkers. Set up a time where you will work without interrupting each other or without getting on social media or Slack. The team I work with at HBR designated Thursday afternoons as uninterrupted work time after listening to this podcast. You can take this collegial support one step further and actively support each other. “Your peers are in the trenches with you and they can relate because they’re in the same culture and organization,” Fernandez says. Go out to coffee with a coworker and “ask for advice, counsel, and coaching.” They may have tactics that have worked for them that you haven’t thought of. Make a commitment to one another that you’re going to change your behavior and check in regularly on your progress. When you tell someone else that you want to reform your ways, you’re more likely to follow through.

Take care of your body

 If you’re tired and worn out, you’re going to be more vulnerable to feeling overwhelmed, David says. It’s important to get enough sleep and exercise. Also, she suggests making “tiny tweaks in your environment” that improve your well-being. Take breaks, eat a healthy lunch, put your phone on silent. “If you normally spend your lunch hour on Facebook, leave your phone behind and go outside for a walk instead,” she says.

Case Study #1: Schedule time to focus

 Over the past year, Emily Lin, a vice president at a financial services company, had a lot on her plate. She was building her private coaching practice and had received a promotion at work. Because of the expanded scope of her responsibilities, she was dealing with a whole host of new distractions. “I got so many more emails, instant messages, and phone calls. And people were coming by my office much more frequently,” she says.

Emily was having trouble getting her work done. “I would see all these instant messages or email alerts popping up, and even if it just took a few seconds to read them or send a quick response, it would take me away from what I was doing,” she says. And it was affecting her mood. “Certain messages would stress me out. I was becoming very short-tempered with my coworkers.”

She had previously learned to set boundaries for herself around social media by scheduling in time for distractions. “I gave myself pockets of time when I could go on Facebook. It might be a 10-minute break between meetings or while I was waiting for the elevator to go to lunch. Once I baked those breaks in, I found it a lot easier to control the impulse to check social media while I was working,” she explains.

She did something similar to address the work interruptions: allow herself time to read and respond to messages, but only after getting her most important work completed. “At the beginning of each week, I ask myself, ‘What are the most critical things I have to complete?’ And each day, I ask, ‘Today, what is the one thing I absolutely have to do?’” She says that helps her determine how much time she needs to focus and then she blocks that out in two-hour chunks. “For a two-hour window, I turn off email, put ‘do not disturb’ on instant messenger, and send my phone directly to voicemail.” She even puts on headphones as a way to signal to would-be visitors that she’s busy.

Two hours seems to be the right amount of time, she says. It gives her enough time to get deeply involved in a task, and it’s a “tolerable amount of time to be unreachable,” she says. “After that, people start to call back or email again.” Plus it gives her a sense of urgency. “I have the adrenaline to get things done.”

Emily says this approach has worked: “It’s had a noticeable effect on my productivity.” And she feels less stressed. “Because I’m not constantly looking at my email throughout the day, my blood pressure isn’t always escalated. I’m a lot more patient now when I am interrupted.”

She points out that getting more sleep has also helped her resist distractions. A few years ago she was only sleeping three or four hours a night, but she has drastically revamped her sleep schedule and is now getting from six and a half to seven hours a night. “I went from feeling overwhelmed and unable to focus to being able to think clearly,” she says. “When I’m well rested, I have more perspective. I know I don’t have to respond to an email right away.” She’s even become “a huge sleep evangelist” with her coaching clients.

Case Study #2: Set boundaries

 Sarah Taylor (not her real name), an HR manager at an international humanitarian organization, struggled to stay focused at work for several months before and after the 2016 U.S. presidential election. She says she couldn’t stay away from the news. “I was spending several hours a day — throughout the workday, not just in the evenings — compulsively checking for updates on various sites, like the New York Times, Washington Post, CNN.” Because of these distractions, she would get behind and found herself working late into the evening and on weekends to try to keep up.

“I was miserable because I wasn’t getting sufficient rest — not to mention I was being continually exposed to bad news every day.” While she knew this wasn’t good for her, she struggled to set limits on her own.

She saw a reference to StayFocusd, a browser extension that sets time limits for selected websites. She checked online reviews and saw that it had helped others like her, so she decided to try it out. “At that point, I was desperate to find ways to fix my bad habit, which I was clearly unable to do through my own willpower,” she says.

She put a 10-minute daily limit on the New York Times, Washington Post, and CNN. Once that limit has passed, a window pops up that says “Shouldn’t you be working?” She says it “definitely helps” — though she does find ways around it. “My sneaky mind starts looking at sites that I haven’t yet blocked, such as the BBC.”

She’s set other rules for herself as well. When she works from home, she keeps all of her personal devices out of the room where she’s working. She still stays up-to-date on current events, she says, “but at least I’m no longer risking being seriously behind on my core work duties.”",productivity
"The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a lawsuit against Elon Musk in federal court on Thursday afternoon, accusing him of misleading the public when he announced he was taking Tesla private during an August 7 tweet storm. The lawsuit claims that Musk made false and misleading statements that ""caused significant confusion and disruption in the market for Tesla's stock and resulting harm to investors.""

The statements in question began with Musk's now-infamous tweet: ""Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured."" Musk went on to double-down on his statement in subsequent tweets, saying that a shareholder vote was the only obstacle remaining before Tesla could go private.

1. Musk did, in fact, pick the price because he thought it was funny.

According to Musk, he calculated the $420 price per share based on a 20% premium over that day's closing share price because he thought 20% was a ""standard premium"" in going-private transactions. This calculation resulted in a price of $419, and Musk stated that he rounded the price up to $420 because he had recently learned about the number's significance in marijuana culture and thought his girlfriend ""would find it funny, which admittedly is not a great reason to pick a price.""

2. The company's chief financial officer, head of communications, and general counsel tried to do damage control almost immediately.

Tesla's CFO sent a text message to Musk 35 minutes after his tweet went up: ""Elon, am sure you have thought about a broader communication on your rationale and structure to employees and potential investors. Would it help if [Tesla's head of communications], [Tesla's general counsel], and I draft a blog post or employee email for you?"" Musk replied, ""Yeah, that would be great."" Tesla's chief financial officer then replied, ""Working on it. Will send you shortly."" Musk sent out an email providing his rationale for wanting to go private to Tesla employees, which was also posted to the company blog about two hours later.

3. The questions started almost instantly, but Musk didn't clarify things for six days.

Within minutes of Musk's tweets, a Tesla investor texted Musk's chief of staff, ""What's Elon's tweet about? Can't make any sense of it. Would be incredibly disappointing for shareholders that have stuck it out for so long."" Several minutes later, a business reporter texted the chief of staff, ""Quite a tweet! (Is it a joke?)."" Musk didn't clarify until six days later, when he revealed for the first time that he was still in the discussion stage about taking the company private and that no official proposal had yet been presented.

4. Tesla's head of investor relations apparently didn't know the situation--which made things worse.

According to the complaint, at least three research analysts reached out to Tesla's head of investor relations within hours of Musk tweeting to ask whether the company had actually secured funding. In all three cases, the exec confirmed that it had. ""Firm offer means there is a commitment letter or is this a verbal agreement?"" one analyst asked. The investor relations head wrote back: ""I actually don't know, but I would assume that given we went full-on public with this, the offer is as firm as it gets.""

5. The potential deal Musk thought he had with a Saudi Arabian fund might have been contingent on building a factory in the Middle East--but he never confirmed this detail.

The Saudi Arabian fund first brought up the prospect of Tesla building a facility in the Middle East back in 2017. That possibility was presented again when Musk met with the group on July 31. According to the complaint, Musk showed he was open to the idea but made no commitment. ""Musk assumed,"" it reads, ""that whether a Tesla production facility in the Middle East was a precondition to the Fund's willingness to take Tesla private would depend on the amount of capital the Fund was required to commit to the transaction. Musk did not discuss his assumption with the representatives of the Fund.""",None
"Some forward-thinking companies bring as much discipline to their time budgets as to their capital budgets. As a result, they have liberated countless hours of previously unproductive time for executives and employees, fueling innovation and accelerating profitable growth.

Bain & Company, with which all three authors are associated, used innovative people analytics tools to examine the time budgets of 17 large corporations. It discovered that companies are awash in e-communications; meeting time has skyrocketed; real collaboration is limited; dysfunctional meeting behavior is on the rise; formal controls are rare; and the consequences of all this are few. The authors outline eight practices for managing organizational time. Among them are: Make meeting agendas clear and selective; create a zero-based time budget; require business cases for all initiatives; and standardize the decision process.

Most companies have elaborate procedures for managing capital. They require a compelling business case for any new capital investment. They set hurdle rates. They delegate authority carefully, prescribing spending limits for each level. An organization’s time, by contrast, goes largely unmanaged.

Most companies have elaborate procedures for managing capital. They require a compelling business case for any new investment. They set hurdle rates. They delegate authority carefully, prescribing spending limits for each level.

An organization’s time, in contrast, goes largely unmanaged. Although phone calls, e-mails, instant messages, meetings, and teleconferences eat up hours in every executive’s day, companies have few rules to govern those interactions. In fact, most companies have no clear understanding of how their leaders and employees are spending their collective time. Not surprisingly, that time is often squandered—on long e-mail chains, needless conference calls, and countless unproductive meetings. This takes a heavy toll. Time devoted to internal meetings detracts from time spent with customers. Organizations become bloated, bureaucratic, and slow, and their financial performance suffers. Employees spend an ever-increasing number of hours away from their families and friends, with little to show for it.

Most advice about managing time focuses on individual actions. Coaches tell us to reassert control over our e-mail, be far more selective about which meetings we attend, and so on. Such recommendations are worthwhile, but executives often discover that their best intentions are overwhelmed by the demands and practices of their organizations. The e-mails and IMs keep coming. So do the meeting invitations. Ignore too many and you risk alienating your coworkers or your boss. And if this steady flood of interactions is how your company gets its work done, you have little choice in the matter: You have to plunge in and swim your way to the other side as best you can.

Some forward-thinking companies have taken a different approach entirely. They expect their leaders to treat time as a scarce resource and to invest it prudently. They bring as much discipline to their time budgets as to their capital budgets. These organizations have not only lowered their overhead expenses; they have liberated countless hours of previously unproductive time for executives and employees, fueling innovation and accelerating profitable growth.

Andy Grove, the former CEO of Intel, once wrote, “Just as you would not permit a fellow employee to steal a piece of office equipment, you shouldn’t let anyone walk away with the time of his fellow managers.” Of course, such thievery happens often, unintentionally. Meetings creep onto the calendar with no clear plan or priority. Initiatives crop up, demanding management attention.

But companies now have time-management tools that weren’t available in the past. With Microsoft Outlook, Google Calendar, iCal, and other scheduling and messaging applications, they can track where managers and employees are spending the organization’s collective time and thus investing its resources. The calendar data show how many meetings are occurring each week, month, or year and what kind they are. They show how many people are attending, by level and function within the organization. They even permit the tracking of certain organizational behaviors, such as parallel processing and double booking, that occur before, during, and after meetings. Of course, a company scrutinizing such data needs strong safeguards to protect employee privacy; nobody wants the feeling that Big Brother is watching his every move. But this information can paint a vivid and revealing picture of an organization’s time budget.

Bain & Company, using innovative people analytics tools from VoloMetrix (on whose board Chris Brahm sits), recently examined the time budgets of 17 large corporations. Here’s what we discovered:

As the incremental cost of one-to-one and one-to-many communications has declined, the number of interactions has radically multiplied. Many executives now receive some 200 e-mails a day—more than 30,000 a year—and the increasing use of IM and crowdsourcing applications promises to compound the problem. (See the exhibit “The Dark Side of Metcalfe’s Law.”) If the trend is left unchecked, executives will soon be spending more than one day out of every week just managing electronic communications.

Executives are also attending more meetings. That’s partly because the cost of organizing them has dropped and partly because it’s far easier than in the past for attendees to take part via telephone, videoconferencing, screen sharing, and the like. On average, senior executives devote more than two days every week to meetings involving three or more coworkers, and 15% of an organization’s collective time is spent in meetings—a percentage that has increased every year since 2008. These gatherings proliferate: See the exhibit “Ripple Effects.”

Although the number of one-to-one and one-to-many interactions has risen dramatically over the past two decades, up to 80% of the interactions we reviewed took place within departments, not between businesses, across functions, or between headquarters and other parts of the company. As for the interactions that did extend beyond an individual unit, analysis of their content suggests that many of them involved the wrong people or took place for the wrong reason—that is, they were primarily for sharing information rather than gathering input or brainstorming alternatives. In short, more time spent interacting has not produced significantly more collaboration outside organizational silos.

At most of the organizations we examined, participants routinely sent e-mails during meetings. At one company, in 22% of meetings participants sent three or more e-mails, on average, for every 30 minutes of meeting time. Furthermore, executives commonly double-booked meetings and decided later which one they would actually attend. Dysfunctional behaviors like these create a vicious circle: Parallel processing and double booking limit the effectiveness of meeting time, so the organization sets up more meetings to get the work done. Those meetings prompt more dysfunctional behavior, and on and on.

At most companies no real costs are associated with requesting coworkers’ time. If you want a meeting, your assistant merely sends out a meeting request or finds and fills an opening in the team’s calendar. If you identify a problem in need of fixing, you convene a task force to study it and, most likely, launch an initiative to address it. Such demands on the organization’s time typically undergo no review and require no formal approval.

In a recent Bain survey, senior executives rated more than half the meetings they attended as “ineffective” or “very ineffective.” Yet few organizations have established mechanisms for assessing the productivity of individual gatherings, not to mention clear penalties for unproductive sessions or rewards for particularly valuable ones.

It’s hard to know exactly how much of this squandered time could be rescued. But our data suggest that most companies have an opportunity to liberate at least 20% of their collective hours by bringing greater discipline to time management.

A handful of companies have learned how to attack this problem directly. They create formal budgets to manage organizational time as the scarce resource it is. They purposefully curb demands on executive time. And they push their people to improve the productivity of meetings and other forms of collaboration. We find that the following eight practices pay big dividends:

One hallmark of great leaders is their ability to separate the urgent from the merely important. They know that everyone must share an understanding of which activities are critical to success. We advocate broadening that understanding to include time priorities. Not only should people be crystal clear about how to spend any extra time they may find in their day, but they should know what they can safely postpone or ignore.

Perhaps no other executive managed organizational time more effectively than the late Steve Jobs. Focus was a key to Apple’s success. Each year Jobs took Apple’s top 100 executives off-site for a planning retreat and pushed them to identify the company’s leading 10 priorities for the coming year. Members of the group competed intensely to get their ideas on the short list. Then Jobs liked to take a marker and cross out the bottom seven. “We can only do three,” he would announce. His gesture made it clear to everyone present what the company would and would not take on. Jobs cut through the noise and enabled Apple to invest the time of its top talent strategically, without dilution or waste. This dramatically accelerated the pace of innovation at the company and helped it become one of the largest in the world by market capitalization.

Increasing workforce productivity requires that every organizational asset be carefully managed. Accordingly, many companies develop their operating and capital budgets from scratch each year, rather than taking the previous year’s budget as a starting point. The best companies have zero-based time budgets as well. Their mind-set is: We will invest no additional organizational time in meetings; we will “fund” all new meetings through “withdrawals” from our existing meeting “bank.”

Take Ford Motor Company. When Alan Mulally became Ford’s CEO, in 2006, he discovered that the company’s most senior executives spent a lot of time in meetings. In fact, the top 35 executives assembled every month for what they called “meetings week”—five days devoted to discussing auto programs and reviewing performance. The direct and indirect costs of these sessions were significant—far more than the company could afford at the time.

In late 2006 Mulally asked his team to ruthlessly assess the efficiency and effectiveness of the company’s regular meetings. It quickly eliminated all unnecessary ones and shortened those that were unduly long, which forced people to maximize output per minute of meeting time. The team also became much more selective about requests for new meetings. Although individual managers at Ford are not required to eliminate one meeting before another can be scheduled, the company’s executives treat organizational time as fixed.

The centerpiece of Ford’s approach is a weekly session called the Business Plan Review (BPR), which has replaced meetings week. It brings together the company’s most senior executives in a focused four- to five-hour session each week to set strategy and review performance. Content for the session is standardized, reducing the extensive prep time previously required. The implementation of the BPR liberated thousands of hours at Ford, enabling the company to lower overhead costs at a time when rivals were seeking a government bailout. It also improved the quality and pace of decision making at the company, accelerating Ford’s turnaround.

Companies often fall victim to “initiative creep,” as seemingly sensible projects are added incrementally. Few if any of them are ever formally terminated. When Gary Goldberg became CEO at Newmont Mining, in March 2013, 87 initiatives were under way across the company, each demanding the time and attention of one or more members of Newmont’s executive leadership team (ELT). Many of those initiatives, including efforts to improve mine safety or increase operational efficiency, were valuable. Others were more questionable in terms of Newmont’s return on investment.

To gain control over initiative creep, Goldberg insisted that leaders develop formal business cases for all the company’s ongoing and proposed projects. Before investing any time in one of them, the ELT had to review the case and approve the effort. Each case had to specify the precise economic benefit the initiative would deliver and also its total cost—including the time of executive leaders. Every initiative was required to have an executive sponsor, who was accountable for managing its progress and keeping it on budget.

These requirements had the desired effect. Many of the projects that had been under way when Goldberg took over were discontinued because no business cases were presented for them. Others were not approved. After less than three months, Newmont had scaled back the number of initiatives by a third and refocused its collective time on improving safety and operational efficiency.

The more management layers between the CEO and the frontline worker, the slower the information flows and decision making. All managers know this, even if many fail to act on their understanding.

What they often don’t realize is that every additional supervisor adds costs well beyond his or her salary. Supervisors schedule meetings; those meetings require content that some people must generate and others must review; and each meeting typically spawns even more meetings. We have found that on average, adding a manager to an organization creates about 1.5 full-time-equivalent employees’ worth of new work—that is, his own plus 50% of another employee’s—and every additional senior vice president creates more than 2.6. The “caravan” of resources accompanying a manager or a senior executive, which may include an executive assistant or a chief of staff, adds further work and costs. (See the exhibit “The True Cost of Your Next Manager.”) As the work piles up, time grows ever shorter.

Given the direct and indirect costs of most supervisors, one way to improve organizational efficiency is to simplify, starting at the top. In 2010 the University of California at Berkeley was facing tremendous financial pressure: The state legislature had cut $150 million from Berkeley’s budget in response to a mounting deficit. To safeguard the funds needed to preserve the university’s reputation for excellence in teaching, research, and access, the administration had to find ways to streamline its cost structure.

In the summer of that year, Robert Birgeneau, then the university’s chancellor, launched what was known as Operational Excellence. The program’s objective was to dramatically improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the HR, finance, IT, and general administrative support provided to Berkeley’s 14 colleges and more than 100 departments. By standardizing and simplifying work by function and sharing management across those units, Operational Excellence removed hundreds of unnecessary supervisors and freed up an enormous amount of organizational time. The restructuring and simplification has saved the university some $120 million annually while enabling Berkeley to deliver more with less.

Most companies place few restrictions on who can organize a meeting. Decisions regarding how long the session should be, who should attend, and even whether participants must attend in person are frequently left up to low-level employees. The result: Costly meetings are scheduled without scrutiny.

For example, leaders at one large manufacturing company recently discovered that a regularly scheduled 90-minute meeting of midlevel managers cost more than $15 million annually. When asked “Who is responsible for approving this meeting?” the managers were at a loss. “No one,” they replied. “Tom’s assistant just schedules it and the team attends.” In effect, a junior VP’s administrative assistant was permitted to invest $15 million without supervisor approval. No such thing would ever happen with the company’s financial capital.

At another manufacturing company we worked with recently, the leadership team took two simple steps to rein in unproductive meeting time. First, it reduced the default meeting length from 60 minutes to 30 minutes. Second, it established a guideline limiting meetings to seven or fewer participants. Any meeting exceeding 90 minutes or including more than seven people had to be approved by the supervisor of the convener’s supervisor (two levels up). This cut the organizational time budget dramatically—by the equivalent of 200 full-time employees over a six-month period.

At many companies, decision rights and processes are so ill defined that the organization devotes more time to managing the matrix than to decision making and execution. In such cases, establishing an organization-wide approach to decision making can greatly improve efficiency and rescue time for other purposes.

Woodside, Australia’s largest independent oil and gas company, is illustrative. The company had been operating with a matrix structure for a number of years. Although the matrix was designed to foster greater collaboration across the company, decision authority and accountability were murky. As a result, the time spent coordinating across functions and business units was rising steeply, adding costs. In 2012 Woodside’s leadership explicitly defined a set of operating principles that spelled out responsibilities, authority, and accountability for the business units, the functions, and the corporate center. A broad training program helped ensure that the company’s top leaders understood the new principles and the implications for their units. A small network of navigators was established to help remove roadblocks and accelerate decision making across the company.

The impact of these changes has been profound. Given clarity on who is accountable for important decisions, executives at Woodside have streamlined how those decisions are made. A significant portion of the resulting saved time is now spent on efforts to improve execution and identify new growth opportunities.

No company can eliminate all meetings—they are essential for fostering collaboration and making critical decisions. But most companies can dramatically improve the quality of the meetings they do hold by establishing a few simple norms:

It’s said that we can’t manage what we don’t measure. Yet few organizations routinely track the critical variables affecting human productivity, such as meeting time, meeting attendance, and e-mail volume. Without such monitoring, it is hard to manage those factors—or even to know the magnitude of your organization’s productivity problem. And without a baseline measure of productivity, it is impossible to set targets for improvement.

Many executives already review how much time they spend with various constituencies and on various issues, using just their own calendars. A few companies, including Seagate and Boeing, are experimenting with giving their executives feedback on the “load” they are putting on the organization in terms of meetings, e-mails, IMs, and so forth. At Seagate some senior managers participated in a program in which they routinely received reports quantifying their individual loads along with the average load generated by other executives at their level and in their function. This information, combined with guidelines from the top, encouraged them to modify their behavior. Time is an organization’s scarcest—and most often squandered—resource. No amount of money can buy a 25-hour day or reclaim an hour lost in an unproductive meeting. To get the most out of your employees, you must treat their time as precious, creating disciplined time budgets and investing effort to generate the greatest possible value for your company.",productivity
"The allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford against Brett Kavanaugh are serious, but too few men — especially male politicians — have publicly supported an open and respectful hearing of her assertions. The problem of the silent man festers at the root of America’s ubiquitous workplace sexual harassment and gender exclusion. Reasons for male silence are legion, but they usually come back to a handful of things: ignorance, lack of awareness, or fear of backlash from other men. A recent report examining sexual harassment in the U.S. Marines found that only 8% of male Marines are speaking up about the harassment they are bystanders to in the workplace. But these “8 percenters” can play a crucial role in changing social and workplace norms.

As the sexual assault allegations by Professor Christine Blasey Ford against Judge Brett Kavanaugh have played out, too few men — but especially male politicians — have publicly supported an open and respectful hearing of her assertions. This week, Senator Mazie Hirono (D-HI), her frustration boiling over at male congressmen who have questioned the integrity or mental status of Blasey Ford, or worse, remained conspicuously silent on the issue, spoke for many when she said, “I just want to say to the men in this country: Just shut up and step up. Do the right thing, for a change.”

The problem of the silent — and therefore tacitly complicit — man festers at the root of America’s ubiquitous workplace sexual harassment and gender exclusion. Reasons for male silence are legion, but most often relate to lack of awareness about the experiences of women at work, ignorance concerning the rarity of false accusations from women about sexual assault, flat-out apathy, or cowardice about backlash from other men. Publicly supporting a woman in this situation can feel risky, particularly among men with a fragile sense of masculinity.

Where should we begin efforts to break the cycle of male silence and collusion in perpetuating harassment and dismissal of women? Start with a few good men. In the wake of the “Marines United” Facebook group photo scandal, Marine Corps leaders continue to face criticism for a culture that fuels harassment. Yet, there is a glimmer of hope. Marine Corps General Glenn Walters recently testified before the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services and observed, “What I’m encouraged by is that some of the [harassment] reports are being generated by male Marines who are seeing another [male] Marine doing something wrong.” He added: “It’s not a significant number. It’s probably in the 8% range. But that’s 8% that we didn’t have.”

True, 8% may seem like an insignificant number of guys who get it, men willing to put some skin in the inclusion game. Yet, we also recognize that this group of men is a critical component in creating seismic culture change, ultimately leading to elimination of sexual harassment and gender inequities in the workplace. These “8 percenters” must be empowered as messengers, or “tempered radicals,” male Marines who can become instrumental in influencing the behavior for the other 92%. Leaders looking to make real change must identify and leverage these men.

This small core group of men are deliberate male allies — men who actively promote gender fairness and equity in the workplace through supportive and collaborative personal relationships with women. They also demonstrate allyship through public acts of sponsorship and advocacy intended to drive systemic improvements in the workplace culture for women. Evidence suggests that these are men who have an awareness of how gender bias creates workplace inequities. This awareness is often motivated by personal experiences and a strong sense of fairness and justice. To be clear, these are men who don’t just talk a good game. They act with conviction and in the face of real social and political backlash.

When it comes to communicating the salience of male allyship in the workplace, it turns out that the source matters. There has been a groundswell of pressure for male leaders to advocate for gender equity initiatives and role model male ally behaviors. Consistent messaging from senior leaders is crucial. However, if men don’t easily relate to allyship messengers (leaders, diversity and inclusion experts, HR administrators), their message may not produce intended behavioral change — or even worse, backfire. There has been a growing list of examples where unconscious bias training, diversity training and sexual harassment training produced unintended consequences.

Male-to-male peer pressure is often a more powerful — and persistently neglected — source of influence for internalization of norms, pro-social behaviors and ally identity-confirming behavior. When a cohort of male allies call out sexist or harassing behaviors, both men and women are more likely to report sexual harassment or check sexist behavior. Women also report more self-confidence, higher self-esteem, and less sex stereotyping when male allies are present in the workplace. Deliberate role modeling by particularly influential peers can influence acceptance and expectation for ally behaviors—respectful attitudes and acts that make women feel included and fuel gender parity. Male allies call out sexism and create a work environment that emboldens other men to question and call out deviant behavior. Such lateral ally influence can redefine what it means to be a man in an organization in such a way that gender equity or partnership becomes regarded as a defining feature of the in-group (“who we are”) and its norms (“what we do”) in men’s everyday lived experiences.

Perhaps Congress can take a lesson from the Marine Corps’s “8 percenters.” Let’s identify the fledgling cohort of male allies on Capitol Hill, and recognize and honor these insiders who can leverage their understanding to redefine norms. Smart organizational leaders of all stripes should be looking for these guys, telling their success stories, and rewarding their advocacy and courage. This form of talent management has the potential to change the workplace landscape in ways that will increase performance, profits, and fairness that will have far-reaching effects in organizations and society.",None
"“I’m worried about the direction of the country; I’m not worried about the Republican party.” That was Republican Governor of Ohio John Kasich's resounding sentiment on October 1 at the Forbes Under 30 Summit in his conversation with Forbes reporter Dan Alexander.

Kasich’s fears permeate every aspect of life, not just politics. “It’s embedded in our culture,"" he proclaims of the country's deep-seeded issues. ""The anecdote is us as individuals wanting to live lives bigger than ourselves.” He characterized the country's current state as ""The craziest time in politics in [his] lifetime.""

The remedy, he believes, is faith. ""Having faith means that when the storm comes, and when the wind blows, it’s going to be okay,"" he said, going on to evoke a few tenements of Christianity.

Kasich was elected Governor of Ohio in 2010. He ran for President in 2016, with Donald Trump defeating him for the Republican nomination. Prior to being elected Governor of Ohio, Kasich served nine terms in the U.S. House of Representatives. The 66-year-old governor was also a Fox News host and investment banker at Lehman Brothers.

Addressing the young people in the crowd, he expressed concern with debt and addiction. ""All the young people should wake up to the fact that you're going to drown in debt if politicians don’t stop playing Santa Claus,"" he chirped.

As for running for president in 2020? ""I’m not afraid to run,"" he said, then added: “I’m trying to figure out how to have the greatest impact. The key in politics is to have the greatest impact. It doesn’t mean I have to hold political office to have a voice."" When asked about whether he would run as something other than Republican, he responded, ""every option is on the table.""",None
"People who work on remote teams face communications challenges consistently. As more and more of our interactions happen digitally, we will continue to experience new forms of miscommunication and misunderstanding. The solution lies in building a skill set that reflects the demands of our digitally-driven age. For instance, when communicating digitally, don’t assume that others understand your cues and shorthand. Spend the time to communicate with the intention of being ultra clear. Don’t bombard your team with messages – it’s ineffective, and annoying. Consider creating team acronyms for digital communications like “Four Hour Response (4HR)” and “No Need to Respond (NNTR)” that bring predictability and certainty to virtual conversations. And remember to create space for celebrations and socializing with remote teams, which can strengthen relationships and lay the foundation for future collaboration.

Remote communication isn’t always easy. Do you recognize yourself in any of these examples?

At 10 p.m., a corporate lawyer gets a text from a colleague and wonders (not for the first time) if there’s a protocol about work-related texts after a certain hour.

After a long and liquid client dinner, an advertising executive opens an email from his boss reminding him to submit his expenses on time. Annoyed by this micromanagement, he immediately responds with his uncensored thoughts.

On the weekly team conference call, a remote team member is confused about whether her colleague is really “on mute” when she delays a response to a question or if she’s just not paying attention and is using this as an excuse.

When it’s possible to be set off by a phone’s mute button, it’s safe to say that we’re living in challenging times. The digital era has ushered in a revolution in communication that’s equivalent to the one surrounding the invention of the printing press. It’s changing how we speak — often in bullet points. And it’s affecting what we hear, as the jumble of information coming at us can lead to frequent misunderstandings and confusion.

People who work on remote teams face these challenges consistently. According to recent estimates from Gallup and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 22% of Americans work from home, while nearly 50% are involved with remote or virtual team work. This continuing shift calls for a new range of behaviors and skills.

Why do remote teams demand new collaboration skills? What’s missing from our texts, emails, conference calls, and other digital communications? Body language. Even when we’re co-located, the tone of a text or the formality of an email is left wide open to interpretation, to the point that even our closest friends get confused. These misinterpretations create an anxiety that can become costly, affecting morale, engagement, productivity, and innovation.

Remote communication can distort the normal pace of our conversations. The delay between our messages can often postpone or hide emotional reactions to our comments. How many times have you written an email and, immediately after hitting send, felt concerned about how it would land? Would your boss see your late night email and consider it to be an intrusion on her private time? Would she tell you if it was? While we may have become used to these types of asynchronous interactions, they can still conflict with our normal rules for social interaction. Lacking an immediate response, we can become distracted, second-guess ourselves, or even grow frustrated with our teams.

To perform at the highest levels, remote teams have to find new and better ways to operate.

First, consider that there are three kinds of distance in remote collaboration: physical (place and time), operational (team size, bandwidth and skill levels) and affinity (values, trust, and interdependency). The best way for managers to drive team performance is by focusing on reducing affinity distance. Try switching most remote communication to regular video calls, which are a much better vehicle for establishing rapport and creating empathy than either e-mails or voice calls. And design virtual team-building rituals that give people the opportunity to interact regularly and experience their collaboration skills in action.

When remote teams communicate well and leverage their strengths, they can actually gain an advantage over co-located teams. Here are some best practices to master:

Don’t conflate brief communications and clear communications: In our efforts to be efficient, we sometimes use fewer words to communicate. But such brevity can mean that the rest of the team wastes time trying to interpret your messages. (And then misinterprets them anyway.) Don’t assume that others understand your cues and shorthand. Spend the time to communicate with the intention of being ultra clear, no matter the medium. Indeed, you can never be too clear, but it is too easy to be less clear than you should.

Don’t bombard your team with messages: Do you follow up on a task by email, text and phone? Do you tend to ask people if they got your previous message? Abusing those access points can be a form of digital dominance, a relentless and uncomfortable form of harassment. The medium you choose creates different demands on the time of the receiver. Using all of them for the same message is ineffective (as well as annoying). Choose your digital volume wisely.

Establish communication norms: Remote teams need to create new norms that establish clarity in communication. Companies such as Merck have created acronyms for their digital communications like “Four Hour Response (4HR)” and “No Need to Respond (NNTR)” that bring predictability and certainty to virtual conversations. Individual teams can also establish their own norms — e.g., to use or not use Slack, Google Docs, or Whatsapp groups. And norms can also exist on an individual level, such as people’s preferred response time, writing style, and tone. For example, some individuals prefer short and quick messages, while others favor lengthy and detailed responses; people also differ in their preference and tolerance for humor and informality.

While we often tend to regard human predictability as a defect, few qualities are more sought-after at work, especially in virtual collaborations. We are all unique, but our consistent behaviors help others predict what we do, and in turn help them to understand us — and we all benefit from being understood. You can make that easier for others by establishing a clear personal etiquette and sticking to it consistently.

See the hidden opportunities in written communications: Being behind a screen can create new opportunities for certain team members, making space for those who might be less inclined to speak out in groups. Text-based communication places less importance on interpersonal skills and physical appearance, offering an effective way to share power and decision-making. Research shows that introverted individuals are less inhibited in online versus offline interactions. However, you need to watch out for virtual unconscious bias, where punctuation, grammar and word choice might reveal prejudiced attitudes towards certain groups.

And the absence of body language doesn’t necessarily mean that we’re not giving away more than we intend to when we communicate remotely. There’s still a great deal of meta-communication and virtual leakage that happens in digital environments, and it only takes paying attention to read between the lines. For example, the use of exclamation marks or a negative emoji after referring to someone’s gender, nationality, or religion is as powerful a marker of disapproval as a disgusted face.

Create intentional space for celebration: Old school birthday cakes are still important for remote teams. Creating virtual spaces and rituals for celebrations and socializing can strengthen relationships and lay the foundation for future collaboration. Find ways to shorten the affinity distance. One company we worked with celebrated new talent by creating a personal emoji for each employee who had been there for six months. You can find your own unique way to create team spaces for social connection. How you do it is less important than whether you do.

As more and more of our interactions happen digitally, we will continue to experience new forms of miscommunication and misunderstanding. The solution will not come from new technologies (although, no doubt, developers will keep trying to bridge that gap). Instead, the solution is in understanding the new rules of engagement; in building a communication skill set that reflects the demands of our digitally-driven age.",wellness
"There are three traits which all good teachers share and managers in any field can learn: how to define and communicate goals, how to identify and build necessary skills, and how to create opportunities for growth. Put into practice, these attributes can help to create a positive environment filled with motivated and creative people, inside a school, a business, or any organization that relies on people to be creative and dedicated to shared goals.

“I’d like to work for a manager I can learn from.” This phrase has come up again and again in interviews I’ve conducted for my team at the World Economic Forum and from more junior folks who I’ve met through various mentoring programs. These people aren’t looking for someone to lecture them, they’re looking for someone who can help them build knowledge and skills as they work toward a valuable goal. As workers get more used to a fluid workplace, where longevity in one firm isn’t the goal and developing a portfolio of skills is more important, managers who can offer learning opportunities will be in high demand.

Having started my working life as a high school teacher, I’ve continued to find success when I use my teaching style to lead teams. Reflecting on how I’ve managed cases and projects, there are three traits which all good teachers share and managers in any field can learn: how to define and communicate goals, how to identify and build necessary skills, and how to create opportunities for growth. Put into practice, these attributes can help to create a positive environment filled with motivated and creative people, inside a school, a business, or any organization that relies on people to be creative and dedicated to shared goals.

Every year, a teacher has to develop a plan for where the class will be at the end of the year with concrete steps for how to get there. The goal might be to improve reading levels by at least one grade or to show understanding of theorems in geometry. The same is true for any organization — you need to have clearly articulated goals that serve a greater mission. And just as it is not motivating in a classroom to say, “We need to read Animal Farm because it’s on the district’s curriculum,” it is not enough to say “We have to write a report on cybersecurity threats because the firm needs something to sell.” It’s far better to say, “We will accomplish this task together because it is an important factor in achieving our shared goals” (whether the goal is to become a better reader or to become a leading threat analysis company).

Good communication about goals goes both ways. Just as it’s the manager’s responsibility to communicate organizational goals clearly, it’s also the boss’s obligation to listen to employee’s personal goals and, where they align with the overall mission, support them and help build the skills necessary to achieve those shared goals.

The ability to understand and build skills is the core of effective teaching and a key management responsibility. A manager can’t lead a team if she doesn’t know what skills are needed to accomplish a goal and if she doesn’t know what the team is good at.

For a teacher, it’s standard to conduct formal assessments over the course of a year to gauge skills and measure growth. Very few organizations are going to sit all employees down for a formal skills assessment, but for adults, you just have to ask and observe. It is vital to discuss the skills and knowledge necessary to achieve success with your team and to understand, through discussion or through past experience what skills team members have and what skills they need to develop.

It’s also important, if employees are looking to build their own portfolio of skills, to ensure that they have opportunities to take on assignments that allow for that kind of growth as well. An effective manager should be able to ensure that employees enjoy a good mix of tasks they can succeed at using current skills and stretch assignments that represent opportunities for growth.

When an employee says she is looking for a manager she can learn from, the employee is implicitly saying that she values opportunities for growth. No one wants to feel stagnant or like they’re not achieving anything. Good teachers, and effective leaders, help those under them grow by giving effective constructive feedback and by fostering a growth mindset.

Thinking like a teacher is invaluable here as well. When a manager understands that she is helping to grow skills and achieve shared goals, rather than just assessing performance, it’s far easier to give useful and constructive feedback. Likewise, creating a work environment that promotes growth and a mindset for growth helps not only employees, but ensures that the team can make new connections and develop novel ideas.

Helping employees grow has an additional benefit to the manager who does it well — the opportunity for personal professional growth. One of the best career tips I’ve received was from Jim Snabe, the former CEO of SAP and current Chairman of Maersk. He said that, in every organization, his first task was to begin training his replacement, so that when the opportunity came for his next step, there’d always be someone ready to fill his role and continue the team’s success. The teacher-leader, by continually growing and teaching her own team, paves the way for her own success.",coaching
"I remember the incident well. A colleague of mine (a new manager) had been slightly bothered by the performance of a young woman who was a quiet but very capable employee... and felt she needed to work with a higher energy level.  One day he decided that enough was enough and it was time to give her a good talking-to. So he did. I spoke with both of them afterward.

He was energized: Glad I did that -- think that was just what she needed!

She was upset: Where did that come from? I'm not sure he's the kind of manager I want to work for...

This little encounter took place decades ago. At the time I remember thinking there was a significant disconnect between how each of them viewed the situation. Today, when I think back on it, I believe there's also a broader underlying management message:

It is easier to demotivate than motivate.

Easy to ""lose"" someone, even with a good history

Issues of motivation and demotivation are important to managers. How do I know that? A couple of ways.

One involves an article I did on the topic back in 2013, ""5 Easy Ways To Motivate - And Demotivate - Employees."" When I first did the piece, I remember thinking, oh, this is an important management subject, it should be a pretty popular article. But it wasn't. It didn't have any compelling ""hot news value,"" so initial readership was light. But slowly and steadily over time readers found it, evidently while searching for info on employee motivation, and it now has more views than any article I've done, over 660,000. Point being, data shows there's something about the topic managers want to know about.

Second point, and not an especially happy one, I know from my own experience how easy it can be to demotivate someone. I was in management for quite a few years, and like most long-term managers had successes and failures. But two of the failures I haven't forgotten involve two of the most talented employees I ever had. These were both long productive working relationships, but in the end I managed, unintentionally, to demotivate both of them. No need to go into the details, but one involved not standing up strongly enough for someone I should have, and the other involved being tougher on someone than the person felt I should have been. No matter whether I was right or wrong, perception as the saying goes is reality, and in the end, even with a long positive history, it was surprisingly easy to ""lose"" someone.

So to return to my main point here. Motivating can be tricky -- it takes the right combination of managerial insight into what an employee wants combined with an organization's ability to provide it. An employee might want more compensation but that might not be available. An employee might want more schedule flexibility but that might not be logistically feasible. And so on.

But demotivating is all too easy. Can be (as in the example at the outset) just a wrong tone of voice. Can be anything: a passed-over promotion, a compensation dispute, a perception of favoritism, a contentious evaluation... among probably 100 solid possibilities. Once an employee has been demotivated, it's hard to get them back.

Which is why it's good business for managers to treat employees thoughtfully. That doesn't mean you don't demand a lot from them -- you always need productivity. But it's also good to be conscious of what can throw them off the track.

No one ever management is an easy job. (Or at least I didn't.) Which is why effective managers are so valuable to organizations.",coaching

Editors’ note: This is the first in a series of posts examining myths about why employees don’t speak up, based on the June HBR article, “Debunking Four Myths About Employee Silence.”

Leaders are supposed to solve problems and drive strategies. Judging by their performance over the last few years, it’s certainly worth considering how they might do better. We believe the answers don’t all stem from better financial models or decision-making at the top or, for that matter, even start in the heads and hands of upper-level executives. Rather, employees have knowledge and ideas that could help head off organizational malfunctions and drive performance, if only they’d speak up.

In this month’s Harvard Business Review, we outlined some new findings from our decade’s worth of research on what we call “organizational silence” — employees withholding information that could benefit the organization. Why don’t they speak up? Sometimes, of course, it’s because they fear retribution: rocking the boat can get a person fired. However, such high-stakes situations where employees are scared to bust the boss are the exception; by far, most silence is about more mundane but not necessarily less consequential issues. Employees often feel they have little to gain, or perhaps something to lose that may be less important than their job, but still significant (status, a promotion, a raise), by venturing forward with their ideas for solving problems, improving processes, or otherwise helping the organization compete.

The problem we see is that attitudes about speaking up are overly influenced by the exceptions — the rare cases of whistle-blowing that expose scandals and unleash media frenzies, or the times when an employee incurs some risk to speak up and subsequently leaves the organization, perhaps for other reasons entirely. These types of cases leave a strong impression, with the result that managers and employees alike may have beliefs about speaking up that are more myth than reality.

Recently, we used a unique opportunity provided by the 2009 Cornell National Social Survey (CNSS), using data from a phone survey of 1,000 randomly selected U.S. adults, to examine what we believe are some of the more pervasive myths. Over the next several weeks, we’ll look at these one at a time, and invite you to join the discussion.

 

 Let’s start with perhaps the most common: “If my employees are talking to me, they’re not holding back.”

Consider this true story about the vice-president for human resources in a financial services firm we studied. The VP was caught off guard by an employee we’ll call Ben who was seen as a highly engaged, high performer who routinely chipped in to help out with extra tasks or training new employees. Though Ben wasn’t necessarily a star in the making, he was broadly considered by management to have the potential to move up in the organization. Ben also routinely spoke up about problems facing the staff and the company’s customers, and offered ideas for improvement. When the VP learned that Ben had secured another job, she sat him down for an exit interview. Though Ben had regularly spoken up to those higher in the chain of command, she was taken aback when he revealed that he knew about many other problems, and had lots of ideas for improvements, that he had withheld. The executive’s surprise suggests a belief we’ve seen over and over: “My people speak up to me a lot; therefore I clearly don’t have a problem with eliciting ’employee voice’ in my unit.”

The reality is that managers can only know what they are hearing, not all the things they aren’t. Though losses from employee withholding are difficult to quantify, we’ve had plenty of employees tell us about the perceived costs of silence. For example, senior leaders in one company we studied would have been shocked to learn that some of their European employees believed millions were being lost because global marketing strategies were incompatible with their country culture. And executives in an R&D company would have been dismayed to know that, in the words of members of the company’s research team, five years of work had been spent pursuing a product that 90% of those working on “had no faith in” and “would have bet won’t work.”

In short, savvy (or simply fearful) employees may be speaking up only about the things they think their managers want to be told. “Pick your battles” aptly describes times when employees who routinely speak up keep quiet because they believe they shouldn’t speak up too frequently or about certain issues. In our research, 42% of respondents who said they spoke up one or more times in the past year about work problems, or offered ideas, also said they withheld them on other occasions because they thought it would be “a waste of time to speak up,” or because they feared personal consequences. Among those who said they spoke up six or more times, nearly 32% said they had also withheld information on other occasions.

The prevailing belief among mangers is that having an open door policy or a suggestion box is enough to encourage employees’ input. But, our research shows these aren’t enough, because they’re passive; they require employees to initiate the conversation. So, not only may speaking up be dangerous or futile, workers also see that it requires effort. We and others have found that employees are much more likely to be forthcoming when their input is solicited. Try knocking on their doors or inviting them for a coffee — and work doggedly to convince them it really is okay to speak freely — if you want to hear “voice.”

In the spirit of this blog series theme, we hope you’ll speak up by sharing your thoughts — including things you think we might be missing in our take on this first myth. If you’re a manager, we’d love to hear what you do to minimize withholding. If you’re sure your employees never withhold from you, please tell us how you know that. If you’ve got a great example that illustrates this myth, please share it so others might learn from it.

"Perception may not be reality, but in many, many cases, the perception of a leader’s ability to lead can make or break it. Whether it’s motivating and inspiring staff, effectively lobbying government and the bureaucracy that surrounds them or gaining buy-in from stakeholders, having leadership presence is critical.

Please meet Dave, a brilliant technical engineer in the mining sector. Dave does not have leadership presence, as evidenced by his complete lack of soft skills. He doesn’t listen, he doesn’t curate his information for the benefit of his audience and, what’s more, he doesn’t believe this is getting in the way of his career advancement.

What he fails to see is that his team is reluctant to follow him because they feel disconnected and disengaged. Some of the highest performers are leaving, yet Dave insists it's all about the technical issues. He feels his success relies on his ability to solve extremely complex technical problems. Sadly, he fails to appreciate the incredibly complex technical problem that is human nature.

Ultimately, Dave had to face the truth. He competed for a promotion against a peer with less fully advanced technical ability and lost. First, Dave got angry, then, as the methodical man that he is, he identified and accepted the problem and decided to fix it. He asked his boss for a coach and worked on his leadership presence. After six months, his boss joked that he almost didn’t recognize him. His team was revitalized and Dave got a promotion at the end of the year.

Perhaps you have had similar feedback but you feel at a loss to know what to work on or how to work on it. Leadership presence often feels elusive and hard to define, but the good news is it can be cultivated.

Our definition of leadership presence is “creating impactful moments and experiences to quickly gain and sustain credibility, influence and trust in the eyes of others."" Research tells us that there are three main factors that determine if you are seen as having presence or not:

• Think: This is what happens in your head. When done well, we will come across as strategic, intentional and wise.

• Interact: This is what people feel and experience when interacting with us. When done well, we will sound and feel like a leader to others.

• Reveal: This is what people see, and how we conduct ourselves when we interact with them. When done well, people are left with the impression that we look like a leader and act like a leader.

The first thing you must do is analyze and research where you might be falling short. This might require paying more attention to feedback or even asking for it. Do you organize your information in a way that’s easy for people to understand or do you info dump?

How do you interact with people? Do you feel that you’re too busy to exchange a few words with staff and colleagues first thing in the morning? Are you a yeller?

Do you look like a leader, dress like a leader, carry yourself like a leader? Do people see you as a leader?

There is no one way to look like a leader. Leadership is industry- and context-specific in the same way that a football uniform won’t work on the ice. Once you have identified the specific attributes that your context values in a leader, assess yourself against those measures and tease out the areas where you can do better.

Leadership presence alone may not get you that promotion or help you achieve that goal, but the lack of it may well prevent you from succeeding.",wellness
"Ten years ago, I learned a very valuable lesson. I was working my tail off and had been for a while. My normal day consisted of waking up at 5 a.m., spending an hour or so responding to emails, then writing for an hour. I would then spend a few rushed minutes with my family, workout, and jump to seven hours straight of coaching calls. After another hour or so of responding to emails and voicemails, I would finally rush home or to one of the children’s sporting events, and then hit the laptop again for some more writing and emailing before getting to bed.

I’m sure many of you can relate to this schedule. In fact, I’m sure there are some who are working even harder. The point of this message is not about making a competition about who is working the hardest, but rather who is working the happiest.

There is an old saying: “Anything unrewarded eventually exits your life.”

Although I was working hard and being financially rewarded, I was wearing down. In my head, I told myself that I was going to follow that rigorous schedule for ten years, and then I would be finished.  The problem was, I couldn’t make it ten years without losing something much more valuable—my happiness.

If you are going to work hard, you must reward yourself to avoid burnout and unhappiness. I wrote in my first book, 10-Minute Toughness, unless individuals learn to recognize when they have done something well, discouragement is inevitable. Life insures that setbacks and failures will come our way, no matter how hard we work to avoid them. In addition, humans have a natural bias toward focusing on and ruminating on the negative or our shortcomings. Unless we make a conscious effort to reward ourselves for what we are doing well, this will not happen naturally. As a result, we are primed for discouragement, burnout, and even unhappiness.

Follow this simple two-step process to get started:

1. Decide what to reward: Start by identifying your one most important activity daily as your “what” to reward. I have found that the most successful people are those who consistently get the most important activities done each and every day. This may be the same activity daily, or it may change. For example, this may be completing a certain number of prospecting phone calls, or it may be getting 30 minutes of cardio exercise done each day. Whatever you decide, if you can nail your “what” daily, good things will happen.

2. Choose the best time-frame: Choose either a daily, weekly, or monthly reward. For example, if you get your “what” done today, you may allow yourself a nice glass of wine after work. If you nail your “what” for a week, you could give yourself permission to take off from work a couple hours early on Friday. Nail your “what” for a month, and you could give yourself a massage or spa day.

Choose whatever reward and time frame that works best for you. Don’t put this off. Your happiness and your productivity are too important. Do not reward yourself unless you complete the work; however, if you do the work, take the reward, even if you feel that other aspects of your life or productivity are falling short. The best way to make improvements is to promote what is going well. Doing so will be a small but important way of keeping passion and energy high.",None
"With a tight labor market and an increase in employees seeking to upskill for the skills transformation happening in the workplace, companies and business leaders are reassessing the skills they deem critical to success in their employees and job candidates.

In an interview earlier this year, Mark Cuban made a prediction that many people in the technical fields found shocking: in ten years, “a liberal arts degree in philosophy will be worth more than a traditional programming degree."" His reasoning is that AI and automation will transform the job market so much that degrees that teach how to think in a big picture way and better collaborate will become more valuable. This is sound reasoning based on the current outlook for our economy and workforce, and a testament to why these types of skills are increasingly talked about.

Last year, Google announced the findings from an internal study that looked across teams to determine the most innovative and productive groups within the company. They found that their best teams weren’t the ones full of top scientists. Instead, their highest performing teams were interdisciplinary groups that benefited heavily from employees who brought strong soft skills to the collaborative process. Further research revealed that important predictors of success within Google were skills like good communication, insights about others, and empathetic leadership. But it’s not just top tech companies that are finding value in these types of skills. A Twitter poll from edX found that people think teamwork and collaboration are the most helpful soft skills in the workplace, followed by critical thinking, public speaking and persuasive writing.

Many believe that the term “soft skills” is a misnomer. Critical thinking, persuasive writing, communications, and teamwork are not fluffy, nice-to-have value-adds. They’re hard-won and rigorously maintained abilities that are better referred to as “power skills.” A term favored (and perhaps pioneered) by Philip J. Hanlon, President of Dartmouth College, who is an avid advocate for use of the word power over soft. That said, if power skills are so vital to innovation and to business success – even in the most technical fields – why are they so often overlooked?

Rethinking The Value Of Soft Skills

It’s a challenge to gain soft skills in today’s fast-paced corporate environment because these skills are not typically taught as a hybrid skillset with other “hard” skills. Learners often find themselves on one segmented track or another. For example, computer science disciplines that tend to focus solely on programming and hard skills; or liberal arts curricula that fosters critical thinking and creativity, but often leave graduates with non-linear career-paths.

In recent years – especially in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis – most Humanities fields have experienced declining numbers in declared majors according to data from the Department of Education. There is a misconception that technical studies offer more employment options, and according to a recent poll of from Harris Insights & Analytics, more than 60% of students aged 14 to 23 look for a college degree to offer financial security as a chief benefit.

Combined with the misconception that employees naturally pick up soft skills, this has led to a general overemphasis on STEM-related concentrations. We are now realizing that this is not necessarily effective, but some people still question: can technical people develop soft skills?

The short answer: yes. A study from MIT Sloan found that soft skills training – even in a factory setting – can improve work productivity in an organization. Initiated at five Bangalore factories, a controlled, twelve-month trial revealed that training in problem solving, communication, and decision-making yielded a 250 percent ROI in eight months. Success factors included an overall boost in worker productivity, faster turnaround on complex tasks, and even improved employee attendance.

Market trends, insights from top business leaders and industry data all point to one thing: soft skills are important and should not be overlooked. The next generation of workers, executives, and leadership will need to have a hybrid skill set balancing an understanding of hard skills, like programming and analytics, with “power skills.”

Google and others are discovering the value of soft skills just from looking within their own companies. But it will take two fundamental changes in mindset to help workers at large achieve this hybrid skill set: 1) unified recognition of the value that strong soft skills bring to a team and 2) the will and resources to foster this valuable skill set in employees. Perhaps the first step is to stop using the word “soft” and champion the word “power.” With this mindset, we can get there.",None
"A crowd of reporters and onlookers watched as former Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein walked out of a New York City Police Department precinct flanked by law enforcement officials on May 25, 2018. He was led into a car that pulled up at Manhattan Criminal Court where he was arraigned for rape and criminal sex act charges and released on $1 million bail, according to The New York Times footage.

The Manhattan District Attorney’s Office released a statement days later announcing that a grand jury voted to indict Weinstein on charges. The office followed up in July 2018 to announce additional charges made against Weinstein that carry a minimum of 10 years in prison and a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. Weinstein returned to Manhattan Criminal Court and pled not guilty to all charges against him, according to Reuters reporting, but the legal process will continue.

After the initial allegations against Weinstein surfaced in October 2017, the #MeToo movement surged. It was part of the catalyst for creating the Work-Related Sexual Violence Team at the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office in January 2018, according to Chief Assistant District Attorney Karen Friedman Agnifilo. The team of 15 sex crimes prosecutors and one social worker is led by Assistant District Attorney Vanessa Puzio, who has more than a decade of experience with the investigation and prosecution of sexual assault crimes. Members of the Work-Related Sexual Violence Team, in conjunction with additional district attorneys from the Manhattan Sex Crimes Unit, manage the office’s Sex Crimes Hotline. Survivors and people aware of sexual violence such as friends, family members and colleagues can call to receive support and advice on next steps for investigating and prosecuting sexual violence crimes.

When there is enough evidence to prove criminal intent, the process of prosecuting a sexually violent crime either includes a plea bargain or a criminal trial with a prosecutor, defense attorney, judge and sometimes a jury and witnesses, according to the Rape, Abuse, & Incest National Network. As part of due process, the survivor is usually asked to testify in court which can, understandably, feel intimidating, invasive and emotionally draining. But there are protections in place to help survivors seek justice, according to Jennifer Gentile Long, an adjunct professor at Georgetown University Law Center and CEO of Aequitas: The Prosecutors’ Resource on Violence Against Women, an organization that aims to improve the quality of justice in violent crimes including sexual violence.

“It is part of the system to be challenged and to allow the defendant a fair process, but skilled prosecutors have ways to step in and defend against harassment and undue embarrassment and prevent questioning about irrelevant things to create a bias against the victim for who he or she is versus what happened,” says Long. In addition, New York has a rape shield law which protects a survivor from having his or her sexual history raised as evidence during the trial.

When a victim calls the Sex Crimes Hotline at the Manhattan District Attorney’s Offices with a case that is sexual harassment but not a sexually violent crime, the department will forward cases to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the New York State Commission on Human Rights, says Puzio. The office also offers additional resources such as free psychological counseling services, says Puzio. ""We make links to help someone move forward,"" Puzio says.

From January to September 2017, the Sex Crimes Hotline received approximately 20 calls, according to Friedman Agnifilo and Puzio, but the number increased to about 120 calls from October 2017 to December 2017. “In 2018, after [District Attorney] Vance announced the creation of the [Work-Related Sexual Violence Team], there was another uptick with 94 calls in the month of February alone,” they said.

The department has also reached out to hundreds of companies throughout Manhattan to help with ""any issues that arise"" and run training sessions when companies are interested, says Puzio. The overarching goal of the Work-Related Sexual Violence Team is to encourage victims of sexual violence to seek justice and to proactively create better workplace cultures in Manhattan.

The Work-Related Sexual Violence Team encourages anyone who believes a sex crime has occurred in Manhattan to call the Manhattan District Attorney’s Sex Crimes Hotline at 212-335-9373.",None
"I'll put it as simply as I can: There are an awful lot of unmotivated employees out there. With a recent national study showing that less than 1 in 4 non-management employees is fully engaged (aka, fully motivated and productive), there is, shall we say, ample room for improvement.   And since an employee's relationship with his or her direct manager is the single most important factor influencing engagement, the responsibility falls to management to improve motivational levels.  Accordingly, here are 5 easy ways to motivate - and demotivate - employees.

1. Align individual economic interests with company performance - Okay, so this first one isn't quite as easy as the others;  it does take more doing at the highest management levels than the rest.   But incentive compensation programs that give employees at all levels of an organization a chance to benefit when a company prospers... can naturally boost motivation (always assuming solid individual performance in order for one to share in financial rewards).

2. Take a genuine interest in the future path of an employee's career  - It does wonders for an employee's attitude to believe that a manager really cares about where his or her career is headed.  Mentoring, coaching, suggesting additional training or coursework -  all of these can be helpful to employees, and highly valued.

3. Take a genuine interest in their work-life balance - To the extent that managers can offer some flexibility in schedules... and be understanding about family commitments, doctors' appointments and so on - such sensitivity can be greatly appreciated.  Small gestures often make a big difference.

4.  Listen - This is an easy one: Just listen thoughtfully.   To employees' ideas for job improvement... or their problems, concerns, frustrations, conflicts, dramas, kids' issues, parents' issues, grandparents' issues - you name it, I've heard it.   Okay, so you do have to separate the wheat from the chaff and as a manager it can wear you out at times - but within reason, intelligent listening is an integral part of the job.  (If someone is a chronic malingerer, and carps for the sake of carping, just tell them to knock it off and get back to work.  But if someone is a good employee... well, people appreciate being heard.)

5. Do unto others as you would have done unto you -  When it comes to treatment of subordinates, this is as basic as it gets.  But powerful too - still as valid today as it was a few thousand years ago.   It shows you respect your employees as individuals, and for the job they do.

Now about those easy ways to demotivate someone...

1.  Use your positional power as a manager in a way that shows you don't fully respect your employees as individuals -  This is the reverse of number 5 and it can be subtle.  Be chronically late for employee meetings.  Don't return their messages.  Ignore their suggestions for how to improve operations.  These may seem like small things to an executive with weightier issues on his or her mind... but the reality is people resent them.  As noted above, small things can make a big difference in one's feelings about work.

2. Take credit for a project one of your employees actually did most of the work on -  This is guaranteed to make people crazy.  Good managers are secure enough to give full credit where it's due.

3.  Lose your temper -  A nasty cousin of  number 1) above.  It's just human nature: People dislike being on the wrong end of this sort of thing.  Lost tempers are often followed by lost loyalty.

4. Don't stand up for your employees when under personal or organizational attack -  Assuming the attacks  aren't merited - just personal or organizational nonsense (which has been known to occur) - your employees will want and expect you to back them up.  If you don't, they'll remember it.

5. Be emotionally stingy -  People like praise.  They want to know they're doing a good job and are valued.  (Assuming they are doing a good job, of course.  If they're not, then telling them they are does nothing except erode your credibility.)   But if they are doing well, simple words of encouragement are easy, inexpensive and can be motivational.

All of these suggestions (other than the first one on aligning economic interests) have the same cost: nothing.  And this list is by no means all-inclusive.  When it comes to motivating employees, you're limited only by your imagination.

Management questions and comments are always welcome.",wellness
"When we think about productivity at work, we often think about how to motivate ourselves. But sometimes the people who are struggling to stay focused and engaged are our peers. And while it may not be an official part of your job description, helping a colleague is the kind thing to do and can be beneficial to your own productivity. To help a coworker who’s going through a rough patch, start by letting them know that you’ve noticed that they’re off their game. Find a time to chat with them at their desk, or invite them to grab a cup of coffee or a drink after work. Tell them what you’ve observed. Then talk openly about the times you’ve struggled with projects or had bad days. And make sure the conversation stays productive. It’s easy for a well-intentioned check-in to turn into a gripe session about what’s wrong with the workplace. Talk through small steps they can take to make progress on their most important goals.

When we think about productivity at work, we often think about how to motivate ourselves — or the people on our team. But sometimes the people who are struggling to stay focused and engaged are our peers. And while it may not be an official part of your job description, helping a colleague is the kind thing to do and can be beneficial to your own productivity.

Here are several things you can do for your colleagues to help them through a rough patch.

The first step is to let your colleague know that you’ve noticed they’re off their game. Find a time to chat with them at their desk or invite them to grab a cup of coffee or a drink after work. Tell them what you’ve observed. Perhaps they look down, or frustrated, or unable to concentrate.

You can’t force a colleague to disclose what’s going on with them, but just letting them know that you’ve noticed that they seem to be acting differently shows them that someone out there is paying attention. They may not want to discuss the issue when you first bring it up, but you’ve planted the seed for future conversation by letting them know that you are there.

And sometimes that’s enough. In an era of hot-desking, flexible schedules, texts, and emails, it is easy to lose the human connection at work, which can make you feel as though you are working for an unsympathetic and faceless organization. Knowing that you have colleagues who care can sometimes be motivating in itself.

Beyond just stating that you’ve observed that your colleague is struggling, you can also help to validate the difficulty of being productive. One of the big motivation killers for many people involves a combination of imposter syndrome and social comparison.

Imposter syndrome is a common feeling where people believe they’ve risen to a position they don’t deserve. They fear that their colleagues and supervisors will discover that they don’t deserve the position they’ve gotten, so they do their best to hide their bad days and the limitations of their knowledge.

Imposter syndrome is reinforced by the tendency to compare yourself to other people. In particular, people often engage in upward social comparisons in which they compare themselves to other people who are more successful on some dimension. It’s easy to find people in the workplace who seem to be accomplishing more than you are. You look at them and believe that you don’t have the same qualities they have.

The problem with social comparison is that you can only see what other people project to the world (intentionally or unintentionally). You see what they say and what they do, but not what they are feeling or thinking. So you assume they don’t have the same feelings you do about your work.

This is why reaching out to your colleague is helpful: By talking openly about the times you’ve struggled with projects or had days when you feel like you are running at half-speed compared to everyone else, you’re showing them they are not alone in what they are feeling.

It’s likely your colleague thinks they are unique in their concerns and frustrations. You can help them more clearly understand that everyone has days where they do not get as much done as they had hoped or worry they’re missing the skills they need to succeed.

This type of validation has two benefits. First, it may help your colleague recognize that their feelings about work are not a sign that they don’t belong in their job. Second, sharing your experience makes you a safe colleague to talk to. People may be reluctant to disclose their own frustrations with work to someone else unless they believe their feelings will be understood. By validating their experience, you make it more likely they’ll talk with you further.

If your colleague does talk with you about the factors that are limiting their motivation, it’s important to make the conversation productive. It’s easy for a well-intentioned attempt to check in with a struggling colleague to turn into a gripe session about what’s wrong with the workplace. But it’s important to develop a plan for the future.

This plan might take many forms. Some colleagues may be ill suited to the organization or their role. Perhaps they don’t resonate with the firm’s mission. Perhaps they just hate the day-to-day work they are doing. If so, then you might be helping a colleague to make the decision to pursue other opportunities. That isn’t always the case, but there will be rare occasions where the plan you help your colleague make is to reconsider their current situation.

More likely, your colleague is suited to their job but is having trouble getting things done. In that case, have them talk through small steps they can take to make progress on their most important goals. It’s possible they’ve lost the forest for the trees. A project may seem so all-encompassing that it feels impossible to make steady progress. But any contribution at work is the result of lots of small jobs done well. Someone paralyzed by the enormity of the project can benefit from focusing on what can be done this afternoon or tomorrow rather than what has to be done over the next several weeks.

Of course, you don’t have to solve everyone else’s problems. And you need to be careful that helping your colleague doesn’t drain your energy or hurt your performance. The aim is for your coworkers to know that they are not alone at work and to help them think about concrete actions they can take to get out of the doldrums.",wellness
"Why is there such a disconnect between Baby Boomers and Millennials when it comes to work ethic? originally appeared on Quora: the place to gain and share knowledge, empowering people to learn from others and better understand the world.

Answer by Mark Lurie, Founder & CEO at Codex Protocol, on Quora:

Baby boomers sometimes believe millennials are entitled and lazy, but this couldn’t be further from the truth.

Millennials have entered a professional world where their realities are wildly different from the ones Boomers knew. They prioritize things that don’t make sense to boomers because their environment has different demands.

For example, millennials expect to be fired or let go regularly, so they want work that is directly in line with their own career equity, which are the skills and experiences that help them improve their career prospects. They know their time is limited, so they don’t invest in doing things outside their own path. Boomers, however, are used to working hard for a company in exchange for long-term investment in skills development and for security, like a retirement fund or pension.

But employment security and long-term investment no longer exist in the modern working world. So what are millennials working for?

Having worked extensively with millennials at my companies, I’ve found they often work incredibly hard. But first, they need to feel like what they’re working toward aligns with their own goals and aspirations. Specifically, I hired a lot of freshly graduated art history students to work as account representatives at Lofty.com. I ensured upon hiring them that I knew what they wanted to build in their careers, and ensure that their role within Lofty would amount to that end. This created a management-employee partnership. They worked hard for my company because they felt they were getting something out of it that benefited them.

This may sound foreign to boomers. They come from a world where they were expected to pay their dues by working hard on whatever the company needed, with the expectation that the company would reward them over in the long-term. Now, millennials will work hard when they are given opportunities that help them provide for themselves without any kind of deal.

In order to bridge this generational divide, we have to update the old bargain in a way that boomers can understand and millennials can use. That means understanding where both sides are coming from in order to make the best possible deal.

But first, let’s talk a little further about where boomers are coming from.

Baby boomers have certain expectations of young employees based on their own experience.

Boomers entered a company and were expected to pay their dues in order to move forward. The understanding was if they worked hard for the company for several years, and the company benefited from their work, they’d be rewarded with pay raises and promotions. If they stayed with the company long enough, they’d have a pension and a 401K.

This was the bargain struck between an employee and company in the old days: you work hard and in exchange, we’ll give you security and stability.

Now, boomers expect millennials to work for the same bargain. They think millennials want to progress too fast and aren’t paying their dues, which comes off as lazy. Boomers also assume millennials are flighty and don’t stay in their roles with any kind of commitment. What boomers don’t realize is the other end of the deal they had, the end that’s supposed to be a payoff for the employee, isn’t there anymore.

It’s a whole new world out there, and boomers have to recognize that if they’re going to successfully manage millennials.

They also have to understand what millennials actually want.

Because millennials don’t expect to stay with a company for the long term, their interest is in what can benefit them now.

This doesn’t come from an inability to commit. It’s the result of massive turnover rates, an unstable economy, and a more competitive business environment.

What millennials are learning from their work experience is they will inevitably get fired, let go, shut down, or need to look elsewhere for personal growth. They expect to leave a position in a very short amount of time, so they want to get paid competitively and want to take on more responsibility quickly. They treat work as a way to build their own professional equity and skill set as future bargaining chips so when it’s time to move on, they’re prepared.

Professional services companies like consulting firms, investment banks and law firms have already found a way to tap into this mindset by offering skills development and mentorship. In some ways, they’re preparing their staff to move on to other companies, but they’re also getting an intense level of hard work from millennials in the meantime. In some cases, the employee feels invested and stays long-term.

Tech companies also understand the benefit of this investment and fight to recruit then keep millennial talent. For example, Google also currently sends employees to conferences and boot camps to improve their skills. This is another way to tap into millennial aspirations for a mutual benefit. The team feels like they’re getting skills they can apply anywhere, and the company gets a return on their investment.

While this is one example of what a new bargain could look like, it’s not the only one.

There are other ways to tap into a millennial’s aspirations, but they don’t come from mind-reading.

Boomers managing millennials need to understand their employment relationship is going to be short, so they have to cut to the point. Conversations around what the employee wants from a job need to happen as early as the interview in order to continue motivating throughout the working relationship.

Some questions to ask include:

Once a boomer has answers to a few of these, they can start to craft a mutually beneficial working relationship with their millennial staff. This means having regular conversations between employee and employer about what each side wants from the role going forward and how the two can help each other in the best way.

One thing I do at Codex Protocol is have monthly meetings with each employee. We don’t talk about their projects or what they’ve accomplished. I limit the conversations strictly to what they want going forward and how I can help them achieve that. I’ve noticed in my millennial employees, they work the hardest when I’ve given them chances to do work, achieve goals, and build their resume toward what they want long-term.

There’s a way to build mutually beneficial relationships between generations, and it comes from compromise on both sides. When given tasks that make them feel like they’re building toward something, millennials will work to help boomers’ businesses grow. Bridging the communication gap between these two generations can lead to greater outcomes on all sides, and maybe we can finally put a stop to all those think pieces about millennial work ethic.

"But when it comes time to deliver criticism, you should realize most people won't see things this way. People tend to view negative feedback as an attack, leading them to respond in kind. Fear of this type of confrontation can hold you back from telling others what they desperately need to hear.

To deal with this fear of confrontation, many resort to the sandwich method of delivering feedback. You begin by sharing something positive, followed by criticism, and conclude on a positive note. But there are problems with this strategy: Some will see through your attempts at commendation and tune them out. They know it's not the real purpose of the message, so the positive feedback goes to waste, even if it was sincere. For others, the opposite happens: they only hear the good, and the points that need improvement don't even register.

1. Give the other person a chance to express themselves.

The right question can help you learn more about what's going on in the other person's mind and indicate knowledge or perspective gaps. If there is something wrong and they can't see it, you can ask permission to share what you or others have noticed.

4. Thank the other person for listening.

Jenny: ""To be honest, I struggle so much with presenting. I always do lots of prep, and I know this stuff like the back of my hand. But I get so nervous in front of a group. My confidence drops, I start stammering . . . the next thing you know, I'm second-guessing everything.""

You: ""Thanks. I've had a lot of practice over the years. You mentioned taking enough time to prepare; that's great-- it's probably the single best thing you can do. Can I ask: How did you prepare this time?""

Jenny: ""For one thing, I did all the slides myself--because I had a very specific vision for how the message should come across. I was done weeks ago, other than minor tweaks. I must have gone over those slides a thousand times in my head.""

You: ""I never used to do that either, until someone advised me to. I've found it really helps--a presentation always sounds differently in my head than the first time I say it out loud. Also, as I hear myself speak I realize that some things may make sense to me, but not to others who aren't as familiar with the topic. If you can get someone to hear you go through a dry run, that's even better.""

Additionally, when sharing your concerns, you should give the other person the chance to respond. Be open to the possibility that you've missed something or even that you may have contributed to an undesirable situation. (In the above conversation, Jenny could have shot back: ""I wanted to practice, but with all the extra work you threw on me, I had no time!"") Don't focus on whether or not the other person is wrong; rather, concentrate on how to make things better.

Once you've established a certain level of trust in the relationship, you can be more straightforward when it comes time to offer corrective feedback. Since the recipient already sees you as someone on their side, they're more likely to understand that any comments you share are in their best interests. When speaking to these individuals, you could simply ask:

Learning to give great feedback--both positive and negative--completely alters the effect you have on others. You're not the clueless boss who doesn't ""get"" your people, the spouse or parent who's impossible to please. Instead, you're the one looking out for those under your care, the one who's got their backs, the one who makes them better.",coaching
"Employees are motivated by different things and having a clear understanding of what drives each person on the team is critical. When I was an operator in the Navy SEAL teams, the motivation was clear. To purge the world of our nation's enemies. Having a deep belief in the mission and being blessed to be part of that unique brotherhood was all we needed. When I became an entrepreneur and business leader, however, I had to quickly learn how to balance the motivations of a diverse team. I have my own opinions on the best ways to motivate employees to achieve the best results, but I also wanted to explore the opinions of other senior business leaders. Here is what they had to say.

“To build personal accountability for each employee in the team to achieve the goal set out before them. We win as a team and we lose as a team, just like in sports. Set up a reward that will be shared by the entire team if the goal is met, rather than just management.”

“All people are different and people are motivated by different things. The first step to effectively motivating your team is to gain a deep understanding about each person on your team. Find out what makes them tick - what makes them feel good about their work. Leverage your findings to create a strategy to keep each individual member of your team motivated to do great work.”

""Give them what they want. If they want more money, give them more money. If they want more time, give them more time. And if they want more credit, then give them credit. It's basic. You have to give people what they want to extract what you need. But, make sure you don't give anyone more than what they're worth. It's important to balance the numbers to stay in the profit zone.""

""It's easier said than done, because you have more than one individual to motivate. The best way is to stick to your role of a leader or manager, show authority and try to reduce conflict. But that's possible only when you know the cause of conflict, which may be due to demotivation. Find out the reason and you're good to go. At times employees are demotivated only because nobody is trying to motivate them. So be that positive figure and you'll see good results.”

“Love your staff and respect them first as people understanding that work is just one key part of their life's journey. Identify and encourage their key strengths and gifts and give them roles, responsibilities and opportunities that require them to draw on those strengths to be successful. Understand what motivates them knowing that each person's motivations are unique and dynamic, depending on their stage in life.”

“The most effective motivation occurs when the team understands and accepts the mission and goals of the organization.  Motivation begins with hiring talented individuals who believe in the company.  It then continues when those individuals are allowed to exercise their talents and creativity freely with full support of management.""

“The most effective way to motivate a team is primarily by having strong leadership. A strong leader will set clear goals for the team (so everyone knows what they're working towards) and empower the individuals (so they can get on with their job). Showing appreciation also motivates the team to want to perform well again, next time.”

“Your team will be highly motivated to perform if you make them feel appreciated. Internal motivation is more powerful than external motivation. External rewards have their place, though nothing is more motivating to a team member than feeling appreciated by their team leaders and management.”

“One of the most effective ways to motivate a team is to make sure everyone is in a position where their strengths and talents are being utilized. When people do work in an area where they excel, they are naturally motivated to do good work.""

The commonalities in the feedback I received are clear. Great leaders understand that it all starts with defining a clear mission and designing a culture that supports that objective. The SEAL community is extremely selective and protects the culture at all costs. Good companies do the same thing. Once the mission and purpose has been well-defined, leaders must then take care in selecting the right people who share similar values and believe in the mission.

Then, empowering the team and giving them the autonomy to make decisions is critical. This gives them a sense of ownership and connects them to accomplishing the mission. When employees feel connected they will give more of their time, talents and energy towards meeting or exceeding the goals of the organization. And when they feel connected to the cause, this leads to greater self-discipline, insight, collaboration and taking collective action towards common goals.

Rewards and recognition are also part of the motivation formula. In the SEAL teams, accomplishing the mission and getting a small paycheck was the reward. There were no pats on the back. That approach doesn't work out here in the civilian world! Intrinsic and extrinsic rewards must be a part of the program. Intrinsic rewards include things like growth, professional development and a sense of accomplishment. Extrinsic rewards include bonuses and public recognition. Keep in mind that rewards must be values-driven so that the team can easily connect the dots between performance and the organizational culture.

Every team and individual are uniquely different. Find he best formula that works and be consistent. Inconsistency in the motivation model can crush morale. Often times, managers and leaders will either keep rewarding the same people because they are top performers, or even worse, ignore them because they feel the person is already motivated enough. Everyone on the team needs motivation.",coaching
"It’s fashionable to denigrate hierarchies. Critics suggest they are too controlled, siloed, and rigid. But they help create stability. And if your overarching strategy is production, you need stability, results and authority. A hierarchical organization, led by a chief enforcer with a command and control attitude is just what the doctor ordered.

The framework for What It Takes To Accelerate Through A Strategic Inflectio Point is laid out in that earlier article. The main point is that you must align your culture, organization, operations and CEO’s real job around one of four strategies. This particular article explores the organization required to support a production strategy.

If you choose to be best in class at producing, you have to produce the right things, the right way, every time. This requires an obsessive focus on stable, consistent results. Your people need to respect authority and function well in an environment marked by command and control.

I’m not in any way suggesting that hierarchy is the right organization all the time. I’m not even suggesting it’s right most of the time. But it is right for an organization in which reliability is key to success.

Understanding the difference between the U.S. Army and U.S. Navy’s cultures will help you understand the concept. As discussed in my article ""Why Organizations Get The Employee Engagement They Deserve,"" the Navy has a command and control culture designed to maximize compliance and minimize mistakes. This is similar to what you want in a production-focused organization: no mistakes.

The Army on the other hand has a culture designed to encourage contribution. Decisions are pushed down and out so officers can respond flexibly to situations in the cloud of war in line with their commander’s intent. This is similar to what you want in a service-focused organization. But that’s a different article.

Zara provides a good example of a production-focused organization. They don’t design clothes. They spot good ideas on fashion runways and then mass-produce similar products. Their secret sauce is their ability to take ideas from others’ runways to their own stores in 15 days or less. They are a production machine.

We were working with one nameless mining company that was wresting with whether they were a production company or a service company. Actually, that’s not true. They weren’t wrestling with it. They hadn’t even thought about it.

Half their executives thought they were in the business of moving dirt. They saw their mandate as getting minerals out of the ground as efficiently as possible.

The other half thought they were in a service business, providing materials to customers who turned those commodities into higher-value products. They wanted to invest in customer service as a point of difference.

One executive asked if they could do both.

They could not.

The reason is that these strategies require diametrically opposite organizations and cultures. As producers moving dirt, they needed to cut out as many distractions as possible. People needed to do their assigned jobs reliably and efficiently – and no more. Customer service organizations need to focus on their customers, doing whatever it takes to satisfy their needs.

Run from hierarchies unless you need them. They are, indeed, controlled, siloed and rigid. A hierarchical organization will suck the life out of designers or customer service people. The constraints will be more than they can bear.

But being best in class in production almost always mandates a hierarchy. You need the stability. You need the ability to command and control reliable, repeatable, efficient processes. If you’re the CEO, the “E” stands for “Enforcer.” Your job is to put in place clear, focused policies and make sure everyone follows them.

In many ways, the choice of organization structure is the pivot from strategy to operations. Strategies are theoretical gibberish until they are put into action. Operators focus on getting things done. The organizational choice brings the strategies to life. And a hierarchical organization design can make the swim lanes clear. In a hierarchy the more individuals stay in their swim lanes, the better the whole organization functions.",None
"Over the past decade, organizations have worked hard to create diversity within their workforce. Diversity can bring many organizational benefits, including greater customer satisfaction, better market position, successful decision-making, an enhanced ability to reach strategic goals, improved organizational outcomes, and a stronger bottom line.

However, while many organizations are better about creating diversity, many have not yet figured out how to make the environment inclusive—that is, create an atmosphere in which all people feel valued and respected and have access to the same opportunities.

Minority employees want to experience the same sense of belonging that the majority does to the group. Indeed, dating back to 1890, William James noted that human beings possess a fundamental need for inclusion and belonging. Research has shown that inclusion also has the promise of many positive individual and organizational outcomes such as reduced turnover, greater altruism, and team engagement. When employees are truly being included within a work environment, they’re more likely to share information, and participate in decision-making.

There are many reasons that inclusion has proved so difficult for most organizations to achieve. Broadly, they tend to stem from strong social norms and the failure to gain support among dominant group members. To understand these issues better, it is useful to look at four dynamics that frequently work against inclusiveness in many organizations.

People gravitate toward people like them. We’ve long known that similarity makes people like and identify with each other. In organizations, leaders often hire and promote those who share their own attitudes, behaviors, and traits. Thus, many organizations unknowingly have “prototypes for success” that perpetuate a similarity bias and limit the pool of potential candidates for positions, important assignments, and promotions.

To counteract this natural tendency, leaders must focus on the systems in place, look at basic statistics, and ask deeper questions, such as: Who is getting hired? Who is getting promoted at the highest rate? Why don’t we have more diversity in various positions or on teams? Who has access to information and who doesn’t? Who is not being included in these decisions? Whose opinions have I sought and whose have I left out? Am I building relationships with people who are different from me?

Subtle biases persist and lead to exclusion. When minority-group employees are hired, they may experience more subtle forms of discrimination such as being excluded from important conversations, participation in a supervisor’s or peer’s in-group of decision-makers and advisers, and may be judged more harshly. I recently completed a study, for example, demonstrating that individuals who were racially different from their supervisors perceived differential treatment in the forms of discrimination, less supervisor support, and lower relationship quality. The findings also suggested that dissimilarity might lead supervisors to favor people who are similar (in terms of race, gender, etc.) and demonstrate bias against people who are different. Researchers refer to this phenomenon as “subtle bias,” which is often a result of unconscious mindsets and stereotypes about people who are different from oneself.

To neutralize exclusion, leaders need to proactively review the access of all groups of employees to training, professional development, networks, important committees, nominations for honors, and other opportunities. Often, employees who differ from the group in power must satisfy higher standards of performance, have less access to important social networks, and have fewer professional opportunities. A recent Monster poll showed that eight out of ten female respondents “believe that women need to prove they have superior skills and experience to compete with men when applying for jobs.” Leaders may need to invest in training to reduce the subtle biases of the workplace.

Out-group employees sometimes try to conform. Often as a coping strategy, those who are different from the majority will downplay their differences and even adopt characteristics of the majority in order to fit in. Female attorneys, for example, might adopt masculine behaviors to foster others’ perceptions of them as successful. But when unique employees move towards the norms of the homogeneous majority, that negates the positive impact of having diversity within the group.

To reduce conformity, leaders need to talk authentically about the issues, seek out, and encourage differences. Leaders should ask important questions such as “What is it like being the only African-American executive?” or “What has your experience been as a female executive?” “How can we leverage your unique perspective more effectively?” While the key is asking the right questions, it is also important to listen to the responses and not react negatively if the leader does not like what he or she hears.

Employees from the majority group put up resistance. Majority employees often feel excluded from diversity initiatives and perceive reverse favoritism. Many companies have experienced backlash when leaders don’t engage majority members in the conversation on diversity and inclusion, explain why change is necessary, and make everyone accountable.

PwC chairman and CEO Robert Morwitz has said that diversity and inclusiveness are major priorities for him personally. Morwitz prefers to serve as a role model and lead from the front. He pushes to have a diverse team on all major issues. Further, he believes that critical thinking comes from inclusion, that is, from the diversity of perspective. Leaders need to put inclusion—not just diversity—at the top of their agendas and mean it. They need to actively talk about its importance, notice when it is present and absent, and set the agenda for the organization.",coaching
"All leaders want to be great, but sometimes the better word choice is simply good. You focus on the good you can do for your team, customers and the world at large. Yes, leaders direct and teach, but they also learn. You aim to create impact and change within the organization, invest in your team and remain accountable. Here are the 10 most important skill-sets that all good leaders possess and demonstrate to their team.

Leadership does not focus on the acquisition of power by conquering and dividing. Real power, that of empowerment, lies in supporting the success of others. This driving philosophy allows good leaders to collaborate with their team because that's where the success of the company derives.

What makes a team successful? It's not the leadership or who is on the team. One study found that trust was the most important element among team members, the knowledge that they work well together and felt safe to take risks.

Your team relies on your support as a vital asset, the most important. Serve your team. Appreciate them and give them growth opportunities.

Give them space and respect. In one survey of over 20,000 employees around the world, respect ranked No. 1 as the most important leadership behavior. Employees value owed respect demonstrated through universal civility and earned respect honoring good work and expressing empathy. Get to know each other to build a positive and productive work culture.

You're a leader, not a therapist or HR. While that's true, you lead by example and must remain aware of the temperature of your team and their exchanges, from a conversational misunderstanding to leaked data. Be a whistle blower and nip trouble in the bud before it expands exponentially out of control. Address dysfunction with clear and consistent policies, as well as objectivity.

Do you know where and how your role makes an impact? What actions do you perform daily that generate this impact? Do employees find meaning in their roles and duties? How does the feedback work between your position and the roles of your employees?

Understand these questions and you will rise to the occasion to impart lasting and empowering change. Don't maintain the status quo, especially when it harms your team.

Keep learning instead of trying to keep up with your competitors. Yes, the marketplace is built on competition and hard work, but your currency exchange lies in continuous education. Cultivate an eagerness and passion for tinkering with ideas. That means you need to keep learning, too.

In order of importance, one study found that the three most vital skills for lifelong learning in the office included critical thinking and problem solving, collaboration and teamwork, and communication. While industry-specific and functional knowledge helps employees fulfill their duties, these areas are important to maintain high levels of performance, engagement, growth and success.

They say it's lonely at the top, and those leaders and game-changers don't lie. That doesn't mean you should be lonely. Instead, you should make yourself accessible and accountable to benefit your team on all levels. Connection matters as much as production and function. Keep up with your team regularly.

Who are you as a leader? What are your convictions and values? Your actions express that conviction and establish your values to the team. You must let others know where you stand. Your conviction and values as a leader should take root in the mission of the company, but they remain uniquely yours.

With all your convictions and values, do you hold yourself accountable, or do you sweep mistakes and worries under the corporate rug? Let your team hold you accountable as a leader, too. Accountability must remain consistent on every level.

The conviction and values of the company, leaders and team all matter and form an active structure to propel the brand toward success. However, character matters most to leadership positions because it focuses on engagement, aligning your beliefs, actions and words.

Do you rely on intimidation, fear and power? That makes you a bully, not a leader.

True leaders nurture and mentor their team, recognizing the power of directing and connecting. You have to let the team steer the ship sometimes. This allows you to see the talent your team brings to the table and reward them in return for their achievements on behalf of the company.

Want to be a good leader? Trust in these 10 traits, from supporting success to teaching others to lead. You get more out of your team and leadership skills when you balance hard and soft skills and direction with connection.",communication
"Work plays a significant part in all our lives. Our earnings ensure that the lights stay on, there’s food on the table and the rainy-day pot is full.

It is no easy task to achieve work-life balance in today’s unpredictable and fast-paced business world. As we grow increasingly more connected through technology and social media, it is becoming more and more difficult to separate work from our personal lives. It is commonplace to check emails at all hours, take business calls at the dinner table and work on our laptops on weekends. How has this become acceptable?

Employers expect more from their people, which leads to them feeling more pressure to achieve greater results. Consequently, this leads to longer working hours, and less time spent at home. As a business leader, you have a responsibility to help all your team juggle the demands of their work and personal lives. Even your most engaged employees may still be struggling to find balance…

Maintaining a healthy work-life balance is not only important for health and relationships, but it can also improve your employee’s productivity, and ultimately performance. Put simply, if your people don’t view work as a chore, then they will work harder, make fewer mistakes and are more likely to become advocates for your brand.

Businesses that gain a reputation for encouraging work-life balance have become very attractive – especially when you consider how difficult it can be to attract and retain millennials. The Oxford Economic suggests, “Replacing an employee costs on average around £30,000 and it takes up to 28 weeks to get them up to speed.” Bearing this in mind, it might be a good idea to keep your existing employees happy. Focussing on work-life balance will help you draw a valuable talent-pool for new recruits and boost retention rates. It will save time and money, whilst ensuring a high level of in-house talent.

Here are some more reasons why work-life balance is important for your people and your organisation:

When we are stressed and over-worked, we run the risk of jeopardising more than just our social lives – our physical and mental health is in danger too.

It’s no secret that when we are overworked, tired or stressed – our health will suffer. A poor work-life balance can lead to a variety of symptoms which can affect our wellbeing. This ranges from the flu to serious health conditions like strokes and respiratory problems. A study conducted by UCL of more than 10,000 participants stated that white-collar workers who worked three or more hours longer than required had a 60% higher risk of heart-related problems than those who didn’t work overtime.

By encouraging your people to look after themselves and find balance, you will significantly limit health problems and absences. This will ensure your organisation is more efficient during business hours and people want to be part of the business and culture.

By helping your people to find the perfect balance between work and home, you will increase their engagement levels. This has many positive effects: According to Tower Perrin’s 2006 global survey; “Companies with highly-engaged employees had a near 52% gap in performance improvement in operating income.” Additionally – “Companies with high levels of employee engagement improved 19.2% in operating income while companies with low levels of employee engagement declined 32.7%.”

Having an engaged workforce will lead to your people going ‘the extra mile’ for you and becoming loyal advocates for your brand and product. This is evidenced by Temkin Group, who suggest that “engaged staff are 2.5 times more likely to stay at work late if something needs to be done after the normal workday ends.”

We all get stressed from time to time. It is unavoidable. However, workplace burnouts are avoidable, and you should make efforts to ensure this doesn’t happen to your people. Burnouts occur when we feel overwhelmed and unable to meet constant demands. The negative effects of a burnout can affect every aspect of our lives.

The inability to separate work from home will massively increase the chances of a burnout, so it is important to encourage your team to take time off and “leave work at work.”

When we find, and sustain a healthy work-life balance, we develop a greater control over our focus and ability to concentrate on the task at hand – this is known as mindfulness. Wouldn’t you prefer a team that is fully focused on whatever they are doing, instead of worrying about work/home?

By encouraging your people to have a healthy work-life balance, you will create an environment where everyone is dedicated to the task at hand. This will improve retention rates, productivity and ultimately profit.

Now we know why it is important, let’s explore how you can ensure your people have a healthy work-life balance:

Vacations are not a luxury, they are a necessity. A break from work will provide you with the chance to switch off and enjoy yourself, it is also a great opportunity to recuperate and recharge. This is essential to help your people improve productivity and focus when they return to the office.

Numerous studies show that vacations increase company productivity and reduce stress. The American Sociological Association compiled a report, which suggests that a larger number of vacations lead to a decline in the psychological distress of people.

An effective way to encourage your people to take time off is to implement a “use it or lose it” system – whereby any unused days will not be carried over at the end of the year or repaid financially.

If taking time off isn’t an option for your people, then it is important to encourage small breaks throughout the day. The human body was not designed to stare at a bright screen for hours on end. It is not good for our health, or our mental wellbeing.

To combat this, you could consider installing a games room where people can socialise and take their minds off work. Consider encouraging light exercise throughout the day and introducing walking meetings outside the office. You can even go out as a team to grab a coffee. Some leading companies will get meditation practitioners in to help calm and de-stress their people.

All of these social investment techniques will positively impact on your teams’ work performance, productivity and happiness.

If you are struggling to come up with innovative ways to improve your employees’ work-life balance, then why not ask them?

If you notice that your people are struggling to find balance, then find out what changes they think would improve their situation. By collaborating with your team, you will get more of an insight into the way they think, and you will be able to work together on strategies more effectively in future.

To help you facilitate these discussions, consider having regularly scheduled meetings, or implement real-time feedback programmes to provide you with data-driven insights. This way you can accurately gauge how your people are feeling at any given time and make adjustments to ensure that they have the right balance.

Finally, it is important to lead by example. If you tell your people to leave at six and not work over the weekend, but you’re sending them emails during these periods it sends a very mixed message. It also puts additional pressure on your people to mirror your working hours. Lead by example and witness how your work practices will permeate throughout the business. There is a law in France called the “Right to disconnect.” It ensures there are limits on the amount of work undertaken outside of office hours. Why not consider implementing something similar at your workplace?

It is important to respect the balance and privacy of your team when they are not in the office. This means you should avoid contacting them outside of office hours to allow them to fully switch off, and recharge from everyday work stresses.

Most of us will spend a massive percentage of our time at work. We let it take over and feed into all aspects of our lives. Bearing this in mind it is essential to find the right balance and implement it in your workplace. This will allow you and your people to switch off from work and give your personal lives equal measures of attention too.

By loosening the reigns when it comes to your people’s work-life balance, you will make huge strides towards building an engaged and productive team.

"What separates the high performers from the rest? And what can employers do to improve performance in individuals and teams? These are two fascinating questions that not only occupy the minds of HR professionals and business leaders but increasingly neuro-scientists, workplace experts and health, and wellbeing professionals as well. Wouldn’t we all love to have our team full of Elon Musks or Marc Benioffs?

In every organization there are a handful of colleagues that just stand out. Even though most organizations don’t measure performance objective - who can blame them, as this is incredibly difficult - team leaders and managers know, which of the staff members are delivering high-quality output consistently. You have these individuals in schools, in academia, in healthcare, in business, and in non-profits too. You surely must know who they are on your team.

These individuals show to the organization, management, and colleagues a new standard of getting the job done. They take the sales numbers to a level that hasn’t been done yet, they improve classroom scores, they solve customer problems in new and innovative ways, and cause a considerable headache to management: if she can do it, how can I create an environment, in which others will follow suit?

Hence, the High-Performance Culture is born. The dream to pull certain levers and push certain buttons in the organization, that will foster collective behavior, modeled after that of high-performers, to maximize the chances of a higher percentage of employees delivering better results more consistently. So in a sense, defining the behaviors that we have studied in high-performers and trying to create a conducive environment (management, technology, and workplace) that will pull the rest of the workforce towards those standards.

But what if this has a price too high to pay?

Focusing on pulling the employees upwards towards high performance can however have negative consequences too , if we don’t consider the other side of the coin, why is the majority of them not putting in more energy, more of an effort, in firstly learning and understanding what is expected of them, and then recreating those behaviours that would improve individual and team performance. I would like to issue a warning here: there is a high chance we will just end up stressing employees more than what we will achieve in the end - and instead, I would plead to foster engagement, and yes, high performance, by focusing on improving the overall employee experience. What does this mean for you in practice?

A lot has been written about employee experience, but there are always newer and more nuanced findings out there, to help us fine-tune the employee experience mix at our workplaces. One such recently published study is the excellent Leesman report, “The Workplace Experience Revolution”. I had the chance to participate at their Brussels launch event, and have learned a lot from the thousands of data they have gathered over the years, and compiled in a comprehensive publication. It is definitely worth reading the entire report, but what I would like to highlight here is the finding, that there is a lot more within the professional control of HR managers, Workplace professionals, Facilities managers than they believe. Here are just a few:

The Office of National Statistics in the UK (ONS) highlighted two interesting and worrying trends in their 2017 report on sickness absences. On the one hand, overall sickness absence days have fallen - which indicates a higher rate of presenteeism. Employees being at work while sick. Secondly, the number of sickness absences due to psychological and mental health reasons has increased, almost surpassing those due to physical ailments. In essence, our workplaces could be a lot nicer to employees.

So here it is: Employees are overworked, stressed and also afraid of the consequences this would have on their employment relationship. And these are some worrying signs that also bare considerable costs to employers. Because these employees are for sure not performing to their best abilities. So instead of purely focusing on the high-end of performance, employers would gain a lot more energy, performance, and engagement back on the mid and long term, by examining what is eroding the engagement and experience of this other, much larger group of employees. Now it’s your turn to take a long, hard look at the experience you are offering as an employer, and I am sure there will be a lot of low-hanging fruits that can be fixed as of tomorrow.",wellness
"There is a lot of pressure on those individuals who are in sales. Customers are smarter than they have ever have been. They can access product information, demos, reviews, and other customers for answers to almost any question about something they'd like to purchase.

And it's not enough just to provide a warranty or service package with a product. Today, customers have long-term relationships with vendors and suppliers. For example, subscription models are more and more popular, and a client expects upgrades, new versions, and continuous support from the product sellers.

I spoke with Byron Matthews, President and CEO of Miller Heiman Group, a firm specializing in sales training and tools that help salespeople be successful with their customers. He and his team have done extensive research on customer experience, what salespeople face, and on challenges and opportunities in the sales process today. One thing Matthews said that surprised me was, ""It's not just about EQ [emotional intelligence] anymore. A person in sales has to be smart, informed and be able to inspire the customer.""

Essentially, Matthews was making the case for ""Inspirational Intelligence"". That is, helping the customer think about solving a problem in a new way and how a product or service might assist in that.

""Customers know what they want, they have all the product information, they may even know how to use it, so by the time they get to the sale, they want to learn something they don't know. Customers want to know what the product is going to do for them long-term or how their business will improve by using it,"" said Matthews.

Not too long ago, someone in sales could do some research on the individual and company they were selling to. They could find points of connection - common interests, schools, mutual contacts and company history. That was the basis for developing a relationship with your customer and even the differentiator in why they would choose your product or service over another's.

Today, that is not enough. The sophisticated customer assumes you may know something about them personally, or even know people in common, but prefers you more about their business - what and who are their challenges, competitors and stakeholders. They expect you to be able to provide solutions they haven't even considered, yet.

I also had the opportunity to speak with Pieterjan Bouten, CEO of Showpad, an all-in-one sales enablement platform powered by AI. They just, in fact, launched the industry's first augmented reality solution for bringing the product - virtually - to customers.

Bouten elaborates, ""Those in sales have to make sure the experience is tailored and personalized. One of the ways Showpad can help, is to provide an experience for customers, which is an evolution from PDF and Powerpoint. Our augmented reality solution will give customers the ability to test, try-out, and experience products without the actual product being in their hands. For example, the customer can test heavy machinery that isn't easily transportable.""

Bouten went on to say, ""It's not enough to do traditional sales training or product training anymore, the landscape changes too rapidly. Salespeople need access to immediate, bite-sized, yet comprehensive data they can use to understand product functionality and customer need. Often there are multiple stakeholders involved adding complexity to a deal. Salespeople will need to be able provide continuous value to customers, and therefore they have to keep up to date all the time.""

Some say salespeople and sales departments won't exist in the future. That they will become obsolete. But according to Byron Matthews, Pieterjan Bouten and other experts in the field, a sales team will still be needed, but the sales cycle will be a more comprehensive and collaborative process aimed toward making the customer happy.",None
"Leadership and management thinking and practice have drastically shifted. We're seeing more than ever that, to fully motivate, engage, and bring out the best in people, unconventional bosses that ""walk-the-talk"" of leadership are instilling more human value at work and developing more human-centered workplaces for competitive advantage.

To continue to challenge our now obsolete beliefs and stereotypes about work and management, we can start looking at some best-in-class examples of how human leaders truly walk their talk.

1. They help people achieve their goals.

Kyle Slager, CEO of San Diego-based Raken, the top-rated daily reporting app and field management software for the construction industry, told me he bases his ""holistic"" leadership philosophy by helping his employees achieve their personal goals as much as their professional goals.

""One of the things we've done to formalize this is make it part of our review process.  For example, we'll set personal goals for the year the same way we would professional goals, and we do everything we can to help each other achieve those goals,"" says Slager.

In the report, Gallup revealed that today's decentralized firms are defined by flexible workspaces and flexible work time. The evidence presented is clear that walk-the-talk managers who provide their workers with more autonomy will increase their performance.

Take Ed Bastian, CEO of Delta Airlines, as a clear example of a walk-the-talk leader. After severing ties with the National Rifle Association for their ""divisive rhetoric"" stemming from the Parkland, Florida, high school shootings that killed seventeen people, Bastian made his decision based on Delta's values over politics. He said, ""At Delta, our values are everything. It's the culture of the company. It allows us to be who we are.""

Many stipulate Bastian's choice to punt the NRA was politically-motivated, but it was a socially-conscious business choice nonetheless. ""I really know the heartbeat of our company, I believe, and when you see something that is so polar opposite to what you believe you're required to speak. And our employees expect us to speak,"" said Bastian.

4. They improve the lives of their people.

Over the years, I've been documenting evidence that suggests that the best leaders  motivate, engage, and inspire people through actionable and practical love. This is demonstrated in how employees are treated and cared for by human-centered leaders, which has been proven to improve performance and lead to business outcomes.

It's easy to forget that leadership is about service and making those around you better -- this is how love manifests itself as a business value and transforms organizations.

To assess where you stand against the high measure of a walk-the-talk leader who loves his or her employees, there's one very powerful question you need to ask: What am I doing every day to improve the life of an employee in the workplace?

5. They listen more than they talk.

He told me in a compelling interview, ""I've [created] what I call an 'open door, open ear' policy. I'm available to discuss anything with anyone -- whether a direct report or not -- and I actively practice listening more than I talk. It's not always easy to have this type of policy. It means that sometimes, I must place my own obligations on the back burner to ensure someone else has the space to freely express what's on their mind. But I wouldn't change it for the world. It has given me the opportunity to learn more about the team and business I lead that I never would have discovered otherwise.""",coaching
"Very important, according to one solid study on the topic.

The research, from DDI, found that empathy (the ability to understand and share the feelings of another) is a  ""critical driver of overall performance"" for management.

In the study, ""listening and responding with empathy"" was highly correlated with key management skills including coaching, engaging, and making sound decisions, as well as overall performance.

Despite this importance, the study also concluded that only ""40% of frontline leaders"" were ""proficient or strong in empathy.""

In short, there was a substantive gap between a valuable management attribute and the common possession of that attribute.

No time to be empathetic

Empathy is often regarded as one of those ""soft"" leadership skills (unlike, say, authority, technical prowess, or the ability to present effectively to an audience the size of a small city). But when you consider that effective management is all about accomplishing work through others, it's shortsighted to dismiss it too quickly.

""We know from research that empathy is on the decline,"" says Bianca McCann, the Chief Human Resources Officer at BetterWorks, who has studied the subject. ""That's unfortunate considering it's one of the most critical capabilities needed to lead and drive employee engagement in a diverse, dispersed and constantly changing environment. Having powerful empathetic conversations is a critical piece of being a great manager, and to truly hear the employee, deep listening and suspended judgment are needed skills. Yet in the busy world in which managers are entrenched, both of these skills are a real challenge.""

Having been in Fortune 500 management for nearly a quarter century, I fully understand the typical hard-boiled business person's reluctance to focus too much on empathy. Yep, at first glance sounds like something that belongs in a Psychology curriculum more than an MBA course. It's hard to show ROI on. We want our managers tough not weak. Results not relationships. And so on. I get it. I've lived it.

But on the other hand, the typical hard-boiled business person sure does want employees who are loyal, hard-working and productive. Yet current management at a macro-level tends to be mired in numbers that show only around 30% of employees fully engaged, with the remaining 70% functioning at some level of ""going through the motions"" to indifference to downright problematic. Not exactly a ringing endorsement of overall managerial success.

As a manager I don't believe I ever really thought much about ""empathy"" per se. I was probably too busy trying to keep my head above water to articulate it that way. But I did believe in getting to know my employees individually, and trying (not always successfully) to have some understanding of what was going on in their lives and to gain at least some insight into what motivated them.

And I would definitely say that the most effective managers I knew -- front front-line to CEO -- were individuals who invariably were able to connect with their employees... and did have an understanding of what made them tick

After all, as noted earlier, management is the science of accomplishing work through others. Easy to forget, but always worth bearing in mind.",coaching
"Since I was young, I've noticed that there are people who stand out from the crowd. The earliest role models I admired were grade school teachers that had something more in their eyes. They showed passion in their work educating students, and I wanted to follow their examples.

These were people with something more, something that was beyond my comprehension, but effectively mesmerized everyone around them. There was something magical about it. These teachers had the power to make learning special, and, at the same time, natural.

Later in life, I found that same glint in the eyes from leaders of social movements, environmentalists, and successful professionals.

From observing these great leaders, I discovered the meaning of purpose: passion, a reason behind goals and actions that motivate you to get up every day to do something more than just making money.

Purpose helps you—defining and measuring what true professional success means to you. Though ideals of success exist and society has created those stereotypes, your professional achievement is personal and distinctive.

A fast-paced and stressful executive life can be defined as successful by more competitive types, while it is far from the ideal of a person seeking a more peaceful life, such as an owner of a yoga studio—and vice versa.

Is having a personal purpose the key to professional achievement?

More important than pursuing a great career is chasing what fulfills you. Everything indicates that knowing and accepting yourself as well as discovering and following your passion is the right path for anyone who wants success.

Who doesn’t want to be a successful professional? Find what moves you and move towards that direction.

You are right to believe that taking that direction is not simple. I also realized that it would be too innocent to believe so. However, not all successful professionals carry the same brightness in their eyes. On the contrary, a successful career often comes with a great burden.

So, how is having a purpose different in bringing true professional success?

Certainly, when a person is aware of their personal purpose, their choices are more assertive and their goals clearer. Making a choice is saying no to a host of other possibilities. When you’re clear about your purpose, you can make decisions with the certainty that you’re choosing the best path for yourself.

The challenges and the battles in following your purpose does not make the path simple; it remains arduous, so don’t get discouraged along the way.

Thankfully, there is a big difference in your journey of purpose. It is the way you face universal life challenges and the unknown strengths within you to face each one of them:

The major difference is that the purpose allows you to know what battles you want to fight and which ones are not worth pursuing.

Not everything we do on a day-to-day basis is enjoyable, and sometimes we can lose focus and even fight over things that will not make a big difference for us or where we work. When we know our “why” we can focus our energy easier.

When you know your aspiration and goals, the way to act is coherent to what you believe in, therefore, more natural.

So, especially for women, the purpose helps to have a firmer and more accurate stance in a variety of situations—including when facing somewhat hostile corporate environments.

Unfortunately in the corporate world—especially as a woman—it is common to allow self-limiting where your self-esteem decreases and you silence your voice. But, at times like this, purpose reminds you of who you are and who you believe you should be. It becomes clear that what others impose on you is not in line with your true limitations. You know you are more valuable—and you make yourself heard.

Empowerment in your profession and in your life is the incredible difference of having clarity in your personal purpose. The courage to be who you are allows you to take more risks, take more action, and speak up. Job changes or entrepreneurial adventures become less complex. It makes you understand that when you fall, you just get up and move on. Your purpose gives you the strength to lift your head when wolves try to devour you. It clarifies what you want, but especially what you do not want for yourself.

The magic is in you. In your ability to believe in what you were born to do.

The strength of a purpose does not make the path simpler, but it empowers and equips you to face each obstacle.

You gain strength from being yourself without fear. You begin to have more courage to follow what you want, not what society tries to tell you is necessary to be a successful professional.

You can and should define what success means to you. So, I challenge you to answer these questions for yourself:

Being successful can be as simple as doing small day-to-day tasks that make you feel good about yourself.

"Extended community-connected projects offer at least seven benefits to students:

Patty Alper adds an eighth benefit. She wants every kid to have a mentor and thinks projects are the right place to connect.

Alper explains the role of project-based mentors in her book, Teach to Work: How a Mentor, a Mentee, and a Project Can Close the Skills Gap in America.

Alper is a board member of the Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship (NFTE) where she discovered active learning and power of mentoring.

The opening chapter includes interviews with five companies all looking for employee engagement-willing experts that could support student projects. Mentorship provides reciprocal benefits to mentors and companies. Executives get a chance to give back and companies build the workforce pipeline.

How and Where Mentors Can Support Projects

The Framework for High Quality Project Based Learning (above) articulates six criteria for high quality student experiences. Mentors can play a role in enhancing each of these six areas.

Teachers also can use their own project planning as an opportunity to consider when mentors can enhance their project design. How might a mentor weigh-in on the driving question for a project and add what he/she thinks is relevant for students to be asking? During the inquiry-stage of a project, teachers can incorporate mentors who can help push students and add to their growing body of research.

For over 100 years, Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts have incorporated mentors into community connected learning and growth experiences for young people.

At ACE Leadership High School in Albuquerque, students co-construct projects alongside their mentors. Their mentors are considered partners in their work and are pivotal in making decisions with the students every step of the way. Student projects are often guided by a client or mentor need and are solving a real challenge or problem -- not one that is contrived or made-up. Therefore, mentors play an essential role in providing real feedback, real input and supporting the students so that the outcome not only benefits the student but also their own place or work.

In the same network, at Health Leadership High School the staff solicits project ideas from community health providers. Projects are connected to mentors and partners and every project must have deliverables valuable to the community. Health Leadership students also participate in a paid internship. It gives the school the opportunity to backward map projects from work experiences which makes them even more authentic. Students are prepared to add value right away when they enter their internship.

In rural Arkansas, Cross County High School (a member of the New Tech Network) developed a virtual mentoring program that includes an MIT professor and a scientist from GSK in Belgium.

Seattle nonprofit Educurious connects students to working professionals who serve as subject matter mentors, creating connections between the classroom and the real world.

Extended challenges build the cognitive muscle for the new economy. Adding mentors to the process builds relevance, motivation and social capital.

"You're giving a speech. You make a serious statement. The audience laughs. How should you respond? That's the question that President Trump faced when he addressed the U.N. Assembly this week. After the president claimed that in less than two years his administration has accomplished ""more than almost any administration in the history of our country,"" over 100 world leaders and others in the audience erupted in laughter.

Trump made light of it at the time and later told reporters, ""They weren’t laughing at me — they were laughing with me. We had fun.”

What happened to the president could happen to you, even if you're addressing only a dozen people in your office at a committee meeting. If you follow these three guidelines, however, you'll demonstrate high-character leadership.

Ask The Group, ""What's So Funny?""

When you get an unintentional laugh from your audience, use what journalist James M. Surowiecki calls ""the wisdom of crowds."" The phenomenon of crowdsourcing is based on the idea that a group of people can make better decisions than any one person can.  It's smart, therefore, to seize the opportunity presented to you.

If you're sincere about discovering what prompted the laughter you unintentionally got, asking ""What's so funny?"" can help you grow. Years ago, during a three-year fellowship on leadership development I had, I asked a group of ten or so people why they'd laughed at something I said.

""It's just that you often make jokes when we're together, so I figured you were making a joke just now,"" one of my fellow fellows said.

That was a revelation. I didn't like hearing it, but I had no idea that this was how I came across. I made it a point from then on to be more judicious in making wisecracks, and that has served me well.

It's not always possible to stop and do this kind of investigation on the spot. If you can, however, you'll probably get feedback that will help you become a better leader (and person).

Appreciate The Varieties Of Laughter

Not all laughs mean the same thing. The U.N. Assembly's laughter at President Trump's statement meant, ""We find this hard to believe."" The laughter I provoked during a leadership development program meant, ""We're assuming you're making a joke as you usually do.""

The first example of laughter is a form of ridicule because the group thought Trump's claim was ridiculous. The second example of laughter is a form of sincerity. The group honestly thought I was making light of something, and they responded accordingly.

Since this is a column about humor, I thought it would make sense to get the perspective of a professional humorist. I reached out to Andrew Tarvin, who shows leaders how to use humor effectively in their work.

""Laughter is a form of communication,"" Tarvin told me.

But it takes a certain character trait to react this way, which brings me to my third point.

Humility plays a major role in ethical leadership. I know Tarvin--we're both members of the National Speakers Association and its local chapter--and I have seen firsthand his willingness to accept and even seek feedback.  Like many of us, Tarvin knows that the only way to improve your performance is to listen to valid criticism.

Unlike many of us, however, Tarvin solicits this from time to time, and then he acts on it. He once willingly put himself in one of the most uncomfortable situations a professional speaker can be in: a showcase for other speakers. Even professional speakers get nervous before an engagement, but there is no more nerve-wracking audience than one made up of your peers.

I was greatly impressed by how Tarvin responded to the respectful feedback that his fellow speakers gave.  Although I haven't seen him make a serious statement that others laughed at, I can envision him responding with humility and grace when this happens.

There's nothing better than a hearing a laugh you intended to get. It's frustrating not to get a laugh you were hoping to get. Even more troubling is getting a laugh after you utter something that to you is deadly serious. The next time it happens to you, why not treat it as the gift that it is?",None
"People have hidden biases that impact how they think, react to, perceive or engage with others. Pioneered in the research of Mahzarin R. Banaji and others, the notion of unconscious bias is now widely taught in workshops and seminars across the world. While it is important that more people are aware of unconscious bias—and the harm it does to people and organizations—other forms of bias and discrimination still exist that are not unconscious but overt.  Unconscious bias must not become a catch-all concept. The risk is that we could make dangerous rationalizations by labeling a wide range of discriminatory actions, forms of preferential treatment or acts of stereotyping as unconscious bias. Our default response could quickly become: After all, that’s just how our unconscious minds work, isn’t it?

The recent events at the 2018 U.S. Open Finals, when 23-time Grand Slam champion winner Serena Williams was repeatedly penalized by the umpire and later reflected about her ongoing battle with sexism and racism in the tennis community, is at the heart of this issue. For Williams, what happened to her is not unconscious bias; rather, it represents the outright discrimination based on gender and race that she has faced throughout her career as an elite athlete. As she put it: “There are men out here that have said a lot of things and because they are men that doesn’t happen to them.”

Many agree with her statements. Washington Post Columnist Sally Jenkins stated that the treatment of Williams on the court was ""one of the nastiest and most emotional controversies in the history of tennis, all because [the male umpire] couldn’t take a woman speaking sharply to him."" Tennis icon Billie Jean King tweeted that “when a woman is emotional, she’s ‘hysterical’ and she’s penalized for it. When a man does the same, he’s ‘outspoken’ & and there are no repercussions.” Noted management scholar Adam Grant remarked that “when a man argues with an umpire, it’s passion. When a woman does it, it’s a meltdown. When a black woman does it, it’s a penalty.”

How can we reasonably tell the difference between biases that are unconscious versus outright acts of discrimination, sexism and racism?

As distinguished social psychologist Faye Crosby has noted, “One can discriminate against women and minority groups without having the conscious or unconscious intention of placing them at a disadvantage.” Her research shows that it is virtually impossible to detect discrimination by individual acts because aggregate level data showing a pattern of disparate behavior or differential treatment is required. In other words, merely examining individual acts or behaviors can be misleading. Larger patterns of bias are required to prove that sexism, racism and other discriminatory behavior or practices are at work.

So, is Serena Williams correct in that there is a pattern of bias in sports against women, or is her situation merely a case of individual unconscious bias? The disparity in pay between male and female athletes shows a clear pattern of discrimination. As of 2017, Williams had received $81.7 million in career prize money, whereas the highest paid male tennis player, Novak Djokovic, received $108.8 million in earnings, despite winning less than half the number of titles as Williams. Williams and her sister, Venus Williams, have actively worked to reduce the gender pay gap across all of the major tennis tournaments. However, some critics attribute differences in pay to women tennis stars attracting smaller crowds and thus generating less money for the sport. Explain, then, why the recent Williams match drew 50% more viewers than the men's finals.

What about the differences in how female athletes’ behavior is judged relative to men? My own research shows that judgments of female athletes are consistently biased by dominate beliefs about gender in ways that reinforce gender-specific stereotypes. These judgments can also penalize counter-stereotype behavior exhibited by women athletes—especially those women who are seen as “powerful” versus feminine (aka “pretty”).

The previous action of “banning of the catsuit” worn by Williams is a good example of being penalized for violating stereotypic behavior. She described her outfit as making her look and feel “powerful.” By contrast, a similar one-piece was worn by Anne White during the 1985 Wimbledon tournament; yet, it the clothing was praised for its attractive design, for it was perceived in a manner consistent with the stereotype of women athletes being pretty versus powerful. This pattern of gender stereotypes was also evident when Serena Williams was asked to “twirl” to show off her feminine attire during the 2015 Australian Open.

I argue that we do ourselves a disservice by over-labeling widespread patterns of discriminatory behavior as unconscious bias rather than addressing the reality that systemic disparities persist based on race, gender, class and other demographic or disadvantaged group membership. There is an upsurge in efforts to raise awareness and offer training on how people can “manage” their unconscious biases. These remedies often start with a person recognizing his or her biases and then outlining steps to become more self-aware. One popular strategy involves actively visualizing situations of having positive contact with frequently stereotyped groups as a way to reduce unconscious bias.  However, recent research challenges this approach, suggesting that some types of counter-stereotyping interventions can increase bias, especially in novel or ambiguous situations. Is it reasonable to expect us to successfully erase the impact of discrimination simply by training people to be more conscious of their unconscious biases? Or are larger, systemic changes based on aggregate data required?

Strategies to prevent or undo the negative impact of discrimination will differ substantially based on how we define and diagnose the root cause. While visualizing activities in training workshops may help with individual acts of unconscious bias, they will not erase the aggregate impact of disparities in pay, negative evaluations of performance, fewer opportunities for advancement, inequity in money for endorsements, or unjust decisions in tournaments from umpires that continue to treat women in disadvantaged ways relative to men. We must have policies in place that are reinforced by inclusive leadership that holds individuals accountable for ameliorating data-driven evidence of bias, discrimination and differential treatment.

I suspect Serena Williams would agree. Some forms of biases are not unconscious— they are deliberate.",None
"Sunday MBA provides ideas on running better businesses and succeeding in the modern workplace, this week from HBR Guide to Leading Teams by Mary Shapiro.

Recognition remains one of the top human motivators. It’s relatively easy to recognize the full team for good work, such as meeting goals and hitting deadlines. But it can be harder in team settings to recognize individuals. How can you give individuals their due while fostering the cohesiveness that comes when everyone works toward the same goals and follows the same rules?

“The nail that sticks up gets hammered down,” a Japanese proverb, comes to mind. Sadly, that’s what often happens to individuals who get a lot of praise from their team leader: Other team members might begin competing for the leader’s attention or, worse, sabotaging the work of the “pets.”

But you still need to give recognition to motivate individuals — and certain team members do regularly go the extra mile. Here are some tips.

You can do lots of things to discreetly show your appreciation for individuals’ contributions. For starters, get to know each member personally. Find out about backgrounds, lives outside work, and interests. Does a team member bike for a cancer charity? If so, ask about her latest race and consider donating to the cause.

Learn about career aspirations, too, and pass along relevant articles, blog posts, or other information you come across. Introduce team members to people in your network who can help advance their careers. You might even sponsor them in professional development training or write letters of recommendation for school or fellowship applications.

You can also privately provide feedback, going beyond performance appraisals. One of the most powerful forms of recognition is to help people grow. Assign them challenging tasks, and coach them. Pass on positive comments you’ve heard from others. And give them as much time and attention as you reasonably can.

Written acknowledgments go a long way, too. Send a note of thanks, and copy senior management and human resources.

Make sure the team gives positive feedback in its accountability discussions. Don’t just focus on behaviors that should be added, dropped, or changed. Give recognition about behaviors that people should continue, and occasionally conduct a session devoted just to sharing positive feedback. Ask everyone to say what they appreciate about each team member. Try prompting people to comment on speciﬁc contributions as well as general strengths.

A design team at an engineering company conducted a positive feedback session immediately following a team failure. While the team pondered everything that contributed to this failure, its leader boosted morale by reminding people of the talents and strengths they brought to the new challenge. The appreciation helped team members see that they had the skills to be successful.

Visibility outside the group is another effective form of recognition. Consider having every member sign proposals and reports submitted by the team. Or ask every member to participate in ﬁnal presentations to clients or senior management.

A senior scientist in a pharmaceutical laboratory saw a dramatic increase in individuals’ motivation (and, consequently, their contributions) when she changed how the lab credited employees. She didn’t like that only her name appeared on research reports and academic articles in medical journals. Over time, it became increasingly difficult to get junior scientists and research analysts to meet project deadlines. So she changed the lab’s practice. When team members could claim authorship, their motivation soared.

Think about your interactions with team members as bank transactions: Every time you give constructive feedback or hold someone accountable, you’re withdrawing from your account. Every time you give positive feedback or recognition, you’re making a deposit. You’ll want to be “in the black.” This means making consistent deposits. You’ll get a great return on your investment.",coaching
"For many businesspeople, the last thing you want to worry about (or do) is managing people. You want to get out there and meet customers and create awesome products and bring exciting new opportunities through your front door. But unless you've hired people to take on the task of managing your employees, then you're still on the hook.

The good news is that you can make that task a little bit easier for yourself by remembering these 7 essential leadership keys, and your organization will benefit as a direct result.

The key to leadership success is to learn to effectively delegate both the responsibility for completing assignments and the authority required to get things done. Many bosses feel that they need to control every little thing that their employees do. This is a recipe for disaster. When you delegate work to employees, you multiply the amount of work you can accomplish while you develop your employees' confidence, leadership and work skills.

Every employee needs goals to strive for. Not only do goals give employees direction and purpose, but they ensure that your employees are working towards the overall organizational goals. Set specific and measurable goals with your employees, then regularly monitor their progress toward achieving them.

Far too many bosses communicate far too little. It's often difficult for busy business owners and executives to keep their employees up-to-date on the latest organizational news. Regardless, you must make every effort to get employees the information they need to do their jobs quickly and efficiently.

Above all, leadership is a people job. When an employee needs to talk with you--whatever the reason--make sure that you set aside the time to do so. Put your work aside for a moment, put down your smartphone, and focus on the person standing in front of you.

Every employee wants to do a good job. And when they do a good job, employees want recognition from their bosses. Unfortunately, few bosses do much in the way of recognizing and rewarding employees for a job well done. The good news is that there are many things bosses can do to recognize employees that cost little or no money, are easy to implement, and that take only a few minutes to accomplish.

No matter how difficult the problem, there is always a quick solution, and leaders are happiest when they are devising solutions to problems. The trouble is that, in our zeal to fix things quickly and move on to the next fire, we often overlook the lasting solution that may take longer to develop. Although it's more fun to be a firefighter, the next time you have a problem to solve in your organization, deal with the cause of the problem instead of simply treating the symptoms.

Without a doubt, running a company is serious business. Products and services must be sold and delivered, and money must be made. Despite the gravity of these responsibilities, successful leaders make their organizations fun places to work. Instead of having employees who look for every possible reason to call in sick or to arrive to work late or go home early, organizations work hard and play hard end up with a more loyal, energized workforce.",productivity
"How many goals are in your company's long-term plan? If you have more than three, chances are you are getting in the way of your own success.

Why would that be? Well, it turns out that when we set too many goals, our priorities fight each other for our attention. Too often--both as individuals and as companies--we choose to check the easy tasks off our lists and leave the tough ones until later.

Unfortunately, those tough ones are usually the ones that are most critical to long-term success.

I've heard a great story about Warren Buffett that underscores this point. Apparently, Buffett heard his personal airline pilot, Mike Flint, talking about his long-term goals and priorities. Deciding to weigh in, Buffett suggested to Flint that he conduct the following exercise:

Flint agreed, noting he would focus on the top five goals while continuing to work on the second list intermittently. Buffett stopped him right there. ""No. You've got it wrong, Mike,"" he said. ""Everything you didn't circle just became your 'avoid-at-all-cost' list. No matter what, these things get no attention from you until you've succeeded with your top five.""

In fact, the leadership team at my company, Acceleration Partners, recently met with some business coaches who reinforced this strategy during our quarterly two-day planning session.

We use these meetings to lay out our most important company objectives for the next three months. Typically, we come up with five or six priorities. This year, however, our new coaches really pushed us to select and focus on just three goals. They said that they have found, based on their extensive experience and numerous studies, that when we set too many goals we actually complete fewer of them.

This got me to thinking about how often we all start the day with a list of 25 things to do and end the day with many of the most salient items still on the list. All of us tend to pass over what is most important in favor of accomplishing things that are quicker or easier to do.

Carrying out Buffett's process as an individual, team, or company is a valuable exercise. In addition, here are a few tips to help you and your team stay focused and accomplish your most important, long-term goals.

There is a significant difference between being busy and getting a lot done versus achieving at a high level. If you want to accomplish big things in life, it may be wise to follow the wisdom of the Oracle of Omaha",productivity
"You’re a new manager. Congratulations! Now you seem to be getting advice from just about everyone and one recommendation has intrigued you – that, as a manager, you should have an “open door” policy. You’ve heard of that term for many years, but you’re wondering how keeping your office door open could be helpful. Is it really necessary?

Several reasons to have an open-door policy are to demonstrate to others your accessibility as a manager, to encourage an open flow of communication, to gain fast access to important or just happening situations or information and to maintain closer working relationships with employees.

Four benefits of an “open door” policy:

Accessibility: Managers who demonstrate high levels of accessibility are more apt to have employees who feel comfortable stopping by for a quick chat to bring difficult issues, situations or ideas to the attention of their manager. This gives open door managers a better understanding and “pulse” on what is happening in the department or company on a daily basis.

Open flow of communication: Those with open door policies have easier access to more informal discussions – and these are the discussions that often lead to important insights about the business. Managers who shut their doors a lot may quickly find they are not in the loop with what’s happening in the department and company because a closed door can send the unintentional message that they are uninterested and disengaged in daily activities.

Fast access to information: Open door policies encourage employees to come by and speak up when issues or important situations arise or when employees have creative ideas. In fast-paced industries, quick access to information is key. A manager closing their door often will eventually cut themselves off from fast breaking situations or information because employees stopping by without an appointment will see the closed door and not want to interrupt, even when something is urgent.

Closer working relationships: An open door policy promotes a culture of friendly openness and builds a belief in others that the manager truly wants to be actively engaged with daily activities, thus fostering closer relationships with employees. Closed door activities can generate a feeling of formality in the work environment as well as a feeling of secretiveness, which can negatively affect relationships with subordinates.

When a manager’s door is often closed, over time it can create a barrier between the manager and his/her subordinates. This barrier can negatively affect many aspects of work from creating a formal, secretive environment where employees are afraid to speak freely to building a belief in others that the manager is disengaged from the business or just not interested; even causing subordinates to feel their manager is not trustworthy or that he/she withholds important information.

There are times that managers, even with an open door policy, must shut their door, such as for confidential employee discussions. Where the office environment is a cubicle for all employees and offices for managers, I recommend holding confidential employee discussions in conference rooms instead of the manager’s office.

Why? Because, over time, if subordinates see the manager closing their door mainly for confidential employee discussions, the manager could create a wave of anxiety that sweeps over the department whenever he/she brings an employee into their office and shuts the door.

"Some brands have a perpetual buzz about them. In ‘n’ Out Burger has their secret menu, DoubleTree Hotels has the warm chocolate chip cookie, The Cheesecake Factory has a menu that is close to the size of an unabridged dictionary. Enterprise Rent-A-Car will “pick you up.” Of course, Uber kind of killed that Enterprise message. How do businesses create buzz and get people talking about them?

It generally comes down to some form of a Talk Trigger, which happens to be the name of Jay Baer and Daniel Lemin’s latest book. I had the pleasure of speaking with Baer about the book and what you can do to create talk triggers for word-of-mouth advertising for your business. Baer and Lemin don’t just share anecdotes, but they have performed original research on word-of-mouth marketing.

It’s easy to understand why many feel that word-of-mouth buzz just “happens.” However, great word-of-mouth is best achieved when you plan for it. Competency doesn’t lead to someone spontaneously sharing their experience on social media. You rarely see a post that says, “They did exactly what we expected, and everything was fine.” Rather, it’s the unexpected.

I used to travel frequently to Philadelphia. I spent over 100 nights at the same hotel each year. One weekend, my wife and I decided to stay at the hotel and experience the city. We asked the hotel if we could bring our dog. The hotel staff responded, “Of course. What’s the dog’s name?” I thought what a silly question. Did they need to put the dog’s name in the registry? I shared that the dog's name was Noodles. My wife named the dog. So, please hold your ridicule.

When we arrived at the hotel, the staff greeted us by name, including, “Welcome, Noodles.” Shortly after getting to our room, there was a knock at the door. In walked room-service, asking where they should put Noodles' bowls for food and water. They proceeded to set down a tray with Sterling silver bowls, opened a bottle of Evian water, and filled his water bowl. They then used tongs and removed two biscuits hand-made by the pastry chef from a container and put them in his food bowl. Noodles was in heaven. And we told everyone about the experience.

When our children were very young, we would spend a week each year at a resort in San Diego. The first year of our travel, the concierge contacted us asking about the ages of our children. They were babies at the time. Each year, upon arrival, the unit was filled with age-appropriate products like the correct size of diapers, cribs, and strollers. As they got older, they removed some of the baby-proofing and included tub-paints and age-appropriate activities at the resort. We recommended the resort to everyone who had children.

However, none of this was accidental. Both properties are part of the Four Seasons brand. These exceptional service examples served as talk triggers to share with others. Having great accommodations and expected service might not have sparked stories. But, the extra touches were unexpected and we had to tell people about them.

Baer explained the four criteria for a talk trigger.

Remarkable: Whatever it is, you have to ensure that the experience is worthy of a remark.

Relevant: If the offer or amenity you provide isn’t relevant, then the customer might wonder what it has to do with your brand. DoubleTree wants you to feel like you have arrived at home. So, having a warm chocolate chip cookie reinforces that brand message. If they gave you a tin of sardines, it might not have the same impact.

Reasonable: The cost of the cookie at DoubleTree is reasonable. It isn’t seen as a bribe. And the cost would not throw-off their financial operation. The warm cookie is a nice gesture, without seeming over the top. Similarly, the tub paints are noteworthy, but not too expensive for it to seem reasonable.

Repeatable: If you only deliver an experience to your best customers, then it might not be a talk trigger. I love that Hilton Hotels has special parking spaces reserved for Diamond members at some property types. However, that only applies to a small number of us who qualify. So, though it’s a great perk, it might not be a talk trigger since not everyone is eligible for that benefit. Everyone gets the cookie at DoubleTree, even if you know you should skip the cookie and hit the gym.

Talk Triggers provides a guide to building word of mouth for your business. The authors offer that if you purchase their book and don’t love it, they’ll personally buy you any book you want. I don’t know if it’s reasonable for a purchaser to ask them to buy a medical school book in exchange, but their offer certainly is remarkable, relevant, and repeatable. How can you build a talk trigger into your business?",None
"When is the last time you sat down with a pencil and paper and actually drew something? If you're not a professional artist or designer or an inveterate meeting doodler, then the answer is probably either high school art class or the last time your toddler demanded it.

Drawing, in other words, is something that most of us leave to professionals and children. That's a shame, argues Anne Quito in a fascinating recent Quartz article. Even if you're terrible at art, setting aside time for sketching can help you see the world more clearly and solve problems in innovative ways. And that's in addition to the science that shows drawing -- even if it's just wonky stick figures -- will reduce your stress and bring you joy.

The full article is well worth a read, but here are is Quito's basic case for busy professionals to find more space for drawing in their lives.

Your mind is less likely to wander if you're actively scribbling down your ideas about a problem, explains Quito. ""The process of drawing something helps you somehow to stay connected. I am a slow thinker, and have to spend a lot of time before I can clean up my ideas and make progress,"" she quotes Fields-Medal-winning mathematician and avid drawer Maryam Mirzakhani as saying.

When you look up visuals online, you tend to get a narrow and conventional selection of options. (Anyone who has ever put 'success' into a stock image website and gotten pages and pages of middle-aged men standing on mountain peaks at sunrise will understand.) Drawing, on the other hand, forces you to contemplate all the options and actively select the one best suited to the situation.

""Close observation of almost any particular [which is required for drawing] engages the senses and heightens experience, making the world seem bigger, not smaller,"" writes design historian D.B. Dowd in his book, .

Drawing is undoubtedly hard, but that's not because holding a pencil and moving it across a paper is is difficult. You probably mastered that skill in kindergarten. What's hard about drawing is actually looking at the world and realizing we don't actually know what things look like. Go ahead and try to draw something everyday, like a cow, from memory and you'll see what I mean. (Mine kind of resembles a bear with a tragic belly tumor.)

That's why drawing teaches you a key skill -- intellectual humility. Or in other words, it reveals just how much you don't know, which is the first step to seeing more and choosing better in life.

So go ahead, next time your wrestling with a tough problem and set aside a few minutes to doodle your thoughts. You might be surprised at the solutions that emerge.",None
"All great leaders have one thing in common: The ability to sway an audience so completely that they can't help but follow in their footsteps. Think of Steve Jobs, Justin Trudeau, and Sheryl Sandberg.

These skilled communicators have the power to sway their audiences clearly and effectively, enabling them to succeed as leaders. Apply the following 5 communication habits of really great leaders to up your own leadership skills.

When do you feel closest to another person? Well, usually when they share their stories. Bridging surface-level conversation is an easy way to move into deeper territory and to bring the relationship to a more intimate level. Don't be afraid to share work mistakes with your coworkers. Make extra time to recount the lessons you picked up from your last failed relationship. Draw the other person in and create a sense of genuine trust--so that they feel comfortable sharing too.

Don't overwhelm people with sharp, cutting words--especially when speaking to a larger audience. In general, we tend to shy away from things that sound potentially threatening. So, unless you wish to alienate people away from following you, learn to be patient. And be sure to convey your words in a manner which reflects that sentiment.

An underrated trait of communication in truly great leaders is the ability to listen. Having a person in a position of higher power really hear what you're saying is an amazing feeling. You, as a leader, can give someone else that feeling. When people speak, especially about important and personal things, be sure to remember what they say. Their gratitude for your compassion will definitely pay off in the long term.

Whether speaking to one person or a large crowd, make sure to leave your mark on the interaction. You may be remembered as the bouncy, outgoing leader or the serious, stoic one. What kind of impression with which you leave your audience does not matter as much as the fact that they remember you, so be sure to brand yourself.

There's nothing people despise more than communicating with someone who gives nothing back. Don't shut down the ideas or thoughts of others without first knowing where they are coming from. Remember--everyone has a story. It's your job as a fantastic leader to find out what they are.",coaching
"Ann Rhoades is president of People Ink, which helps companies build values-based corporate cultures using the Values Blueprint principles. She was one of the five founding executives of JetBlue Airways and served as chief people officer at Southwest Airlines. In her book Built on Values, Ann shares in-depth details on hiring and keeping A Players. Ann’s clients range from hospitals, banks and airlines to hotel chains, technology companies, and non-profit organizations.

Rodger Dean Duncan: Your book is about creating and maintaining a workplace environment that brings out the best in people. What have you found to be some of the most common misuses of the idea of values?

Ann Rhoades: Giving only lip service to the values is a common mistake made by leaders. They plaster value statements or words on a wall or brochure but then fail to hold people accountable for the behaviors related to the values. Living a values model is all about behaviors and making the tough decisions around those values. I refer to it as getting the right results the right way! Not just advertising the right values, but putting the related behaviors into action and holding everyone accountable for those behaviors! No exceptions.

A cardiac surgeon in a prominent hospital system we worked with was so well known that the CEO was reluctant to let him go. But he eventually did because the surgeon’s behaviors were the opposite of what the system held others accountable for. The hospital system found that it was one of their best decisions. That decision totally reinforced the principle that everyone would be held accountable, regardless of position or skill level.

Duncan: You served as chief people officer at Southwest Airlines, a company known for its people-friendly culture and its consistently strong financial performance. What’s the relationship between the two?

Rhoades: It has been a long held premise of mine that leaders drive values and related behaviors. This creates the culture and ultimately determines performance. Southwest is a great example of a company that has lived this values model for more than 50 years and has continued to financially outperform their airline industry competitors.

Duncan: Some organizations hire (or promote) leaders who have strong technical skills but who don’t really measure up on the “people stuff.” What advice do you offer on how to avoid this compromise?

Rhoades: No exceptions on hiring people with the right values! At the start of JetBlue, we were required to hire maintenance players and we erred on hiring one particular person with outstanding technical skills but who did not lead or live the values model we had defined as part of our DNA. We soon realized our error and let this individual go. Once we put in a full behavioral hiring model around the values and related behaviors we were able to avoid for the most part these errors on an ongoing basis.

Duncan: “Culture change” is on the minds of a lot of business people. What are the most critical steps for transitioning from one culture to another?

Rhoades: The first step is gaining, through assessment, accurate data on what the “culture” really is versus what you want it to be. Gather feedback from both employees and customers. Then set about developing a change model that incorporates the values and behaviors you want to see throughout the organization. Build a hiring model around the respective behaviors, start communicating the new model for behavior, and set a time to start holding everyone accountable for these behaviors.

Also, build a reward and recognition program around these behaviors and start circulating stories about people living those values. Examples are critical and very impactful. It will take two to three years in a large organization and up to a year in most small companies to see the real results with both your employees and customers.

By the way, at some point the impact should be very noticeable to your customers. The comment and change should be obvious from the top and all around the organization. Treat this emphasis on values like any other well-organized project, with a Values Committee focusing on employees from all levels of the organization.

Duncan: What are some of the keys to sustaining a values-centric organizational culture once it’s established?

Rhoades: The most important key is commitment at the top for the resources and time. Secondly, the values must be lived, and everyone needs to know this is not just some “Flavor of the Month” project. Values must become part of the DNA of the entire organization. That’s when you will know your culture is working to the organization’s advantage.

Duncan: You talk a lot about finding, hiring, and keeping A Players. Tell us more about that.

Rhoades: A Players are the people who genuinely live your company’s values, every day. They’re not always the high-flying world-beaters, and they don’t even have to be part of your leadership team. They could be the front-line employees who smile, who go out of their way to be helpful, who care that things are done right. They are the people who help great companies and great leaders reach their full potential.

The most important positions in your organization are any that directly touch your customers. To your customers, your company is your front-line employees. If you want to attract and retain more customers, you must concentrate on putting A Players there first. Your organization will work as a well-oiled, value-generating machine only if you try, over time, to recruit, hire, train and reward as many A Players as you can.

Bottom line? The most successful companies are those that only hire A Players. They don’t just hire the best of the available applicants simply because they need to fill a position. If they have to, they delay hiring until they find the A Players – those employees who do more than is required, live the company’s values, and truly add value to the organization.

Of course, waiting to hire may mean that you have to delay the opening of a new facility, pay overtime, or be understaffed until you find the right people. A Players aren’t always packaged the way you expect. But when you find them, they help you outperform the competition.",coaching
"Building and operating these businesses has never been a one-person effort. I've hired hundreds of freelancers to help me plan, write, design, and do countless other tasks. Along the way, I observed that some the best people don't ask for raises--ever!

Your best freelancers and team members may never ask you for a raise, but it's in your best interest to give them one. Keep reading to learn why, plus how to determine when someone shouldn't get a raise.

At its core, money is a reflection of value. So it follows that when you offer to give someone a raise, you're showing the person that you value them.

Each person you hire is working to build your business and fulfill your creative vision. They deserve to be honored and appreciated, and giving an unexpected raise is a great way to do so.

Not only does giving a raise communicate how much you value someone, it's also a representation of the person's increasing value to you.

As someone works with you for a period of time and begins to understand the way you do things, they save more time, do a better a job, and create more value for your business.

It keeps up your team's motivation.

As humans, whenever we work really hard on something and achieve success, we like to reward ourselves by throwing a party or treating ourselves to something we wouldn't usually buy. Celebrating wins is important in acknowledging someone's hard work and giving them an opportunity to enjoy the fruits of their labor before diving back into the next project. What better way to celebrate a win than by giving that person a raise?

It's also a way to keep your team excited for the future. Everyone wants to feel like they're moving forward in life. Working for months or years at a time without advancing in your career can feel discouraging, and giving a raise, whether big or small, allows your team to continue to move forward and maintain their motivation to keep doing their best.

It sets you apart from your competitors.

The common understanding among freelancers is that it's difficult to raise prices with an existing client. Following that line of logic, if you want a raise, you should get a new client at a higher price and let the old client go. In companies, too, it can be difficult to negotiate a raise with your boss, and many people end up looking for new opportunities elsewhere.

If you commit to increasing your freelancers' and employees' rates, you'll stand out from other clients and companies in your industry. You'll be the good client that freelancers want to work for, and the good boss that earns the loyalty of their employees.

That said, there are times when you shouldn't give someone a raise.

Yes, giving a raise is extremely beneficial. But it should be given to the right person.",None
"""It doesn't make sense to hire smart people and tell them what to do; we hire smart people so they can tell us what to do."" --Steve Jobs

Steve Jobs was a pretty smart dude (to understate wildly), so it doesn't surprise me he'd have smart things to say about talent management. But I have to say when I came across the above thought yesterday, I felt it was the best single sentence I've ever read about management.

One of the key challenges that smart people, of whom business has many, face in management on a daily basis is subjugating their own ego. Subjugating their own ego so they can get better results for their organization than if they didn't.

Because it's a natural tendency for folks who are expert in one thing to feel they're expert in all things. Which can quickly lead to nettlesome micromanagement - an easy recipe for frustrating up-and-coming talent in its own right. But the best managers know that it's not about their personal accomplishment but about their team's - which involves fully unleashing the talent of the smart people all around them. Which I believe is exactly what Mr. Jobs was saying.

""Tell them what to do, not how to do it""

This whole train of thought reminded me of an old story. A long time ago a very creative, accomplished woman whom I was managing grew weary of my overinvolvement (aka, meddling micromanagement) in her projects. One day to her everlasting credit she took me aside and said to me, ""You know, when you're managing creative people you'll get the best results by telling them what to do, not how to do it."" A little different twist than the Jobs quote, but a similar sentiment. Point being, don't prescribe solutions but let creative people figure things out. They'll find a better way. My direct report was 100% right and I never forgot what she said. In many instances leadership is best served by providing sound strategic direction and then getting the heck out of the way.

Later in my management career at one point I believe I was probably the only person in our company managing two people with PhDs. They knew a lot more than I did about most things, and though I'm sure I sometimes screwed up I did try to bear in mind what the woman noted above told me. As a manager ""it's not about you,"" but it is about optimizing talent.

Which judging by his results Steve Jobs understood a whole lot better than the rest of us.",coaching
"In order to move forward in life, your brain uses two kinds of coping strategies: enabling beliefs and limiting beliefs. Enabling beliefs are what successful people possess in abundance. Such beliefs underlie optimism, reasonable risk-taking and achievement. They are what allow you to fulfill your potential and become all that you are capable of.

On the other hand, limiting beliefs are what hold you back, discourage striving and ultimately result in mediocre performance and prospective failure.

So, if limiting beliefs are not serving you, why do you have them in the first place? Often, their genesis is in previous life experiences dating back as far as early childhood. Interactions with parents, friends and teachers have all had a role to play in the establishment of these deep-seated beliefs. And, it is often said they really do have a beneficial purpose, which is to ""keep you safe."" But I challenge this statement.

You are the one who gives significance to certain events and not enough to others. For example, is it really important that Kathy or Billy snubbed you when you were in the fifth grade? No doubt it's not, but you still carry this around with you as if it means something. Or, maybe your mother was a super role model of how to behave in life, but you ignored her example and simply went on to live your own perhaps not-so-exemplary life.

Your selection of which events you do and don't give significance to is usually haphazard and serendipitous, without order or structure.

But whether your beliefs are enabling or limiting, they are formed based on previous experiences, whether those experiences have been positive or negative. You often don’t even notice how your experiences have led to certain beliefs, and before you know it, those beliefs have begun shaping your life. And, once you have them, the forward course of least resistance is to accept them as true, without challenge.

To prove this, let’s take a statement you might have made concerning a limiting belief, i.e., “I don’t know why I do that.” Haven’t you said that to yourself at least once? I argue that you actually do know why you “do that."" It’s because you have a limiting belief.

To illustrate, take the following examples, each of which is a statement that contains a hidden limiting belief:

1. “I want to find a life partner, but I'm avoiding online dating.”

2. “I want to leave my current job, but I haven’t updated my resume yet.”

3. “My current relationship isn’t working, but I am not doing anything about it.”

Each of the above statements actually does suggest a reason why you “do that.""

In the first statement, you maybe be avoiding online dating because you have a limiting belief that you’re not attractive enough to find a partner.

In the second statement, your limiting belief may be that you’re too old to find a better job.

In the third statement, your unstated limiting belief may be that you’re not capable of finding a better partner.

Limiting beliefs are at the heart of your lack of ability to move forward, and unless you address them, you’re forever going to be hamstrung. They support an inner voice that is not really reflective of who you are or who you can become. By listening to this voice, you unconsciously diminish your own potential.

I believe there is no greater impediment to becoming the accomplished person you want to become than justifying your actions (or failure to act) by relying on limiting beliefs. When you stay in the comfort zone created by these limiting beliefs, you cannot generate the positive creative energy needed in order to follow through and create the desired change. It is up to you to identify your often hidden or unstated limiting beliefs and take action to overcome them. Only after you have replaced your limiting beliefs with enabling beliefs can you achieve, prosper and grow.

This requires that you adopt three preliminary modes of thinking:

1. Understand the need for overcoming and eliminating limiting beliefs.

By challenging each identified limiting belief, you close the gap between your land of limitations and your land of possibilities. You tear down your old roadblocks and create solid building material for the bridge to connect those two lands. Once they are eliminated, you can replace them with enabling beliefs, allowing full realization of your potential.

2. Feel confident that limiting beliefs can be eliminated and replaced by enabling beliefs.

Once you understand all the necessary steps in order to destroy your limiting beliefs, you need to remember that, as a general proposition, they can be eliminated and replaced by enabling beliefs. Thousands before you have done it.

3. Appreciate that you personally have the power to replace limiting beliefs in accord with your personal values and desired outcomes.

Not only have multitudes of people replaced their limiting beliefs with enabling beliefs, but you must know and inherently feel that you can join their ranks. All you have to do is own it.

The enabling beliefs that I challenge you to adopt are not a generic, one-size-fits-all collection. They are your own personal and individual set, tailored by you to fit your life and your goals and aspirations. They incorporate and reflect your unique values. As such, they become powerful handcrafted tools, allowing you to move forward in life with confidence and certainty.

You are an executive driver of your own life. So, once and for all, take the power away from your limiting beliefs and give it to your enabling beliefs. Stop listening to that tiny voice, which has deprived you of the ability to compete in the world.

Do you really believe that guy or gal who got that job or promotion in front of you was hampered by a tiny voice telling him or her that they weren't good enough? Certainly not. Level the playing field and eliminate your limiting beliefs. Be curious about replacing them with opportunity, creating enabling beliefs.

The good news is you have already taken the first step by reading this article. So, the next time you have the opportunity to do so, are you going to accept or ignore the restrictions that your limiting beliefs are placing on you?",None
"Depression, a silent illness of the mind, is all too prevalent in the U.S. When depression is gone untreated, it can result in some very negative consequences. In the recent year we have seen tragic consequences of depression, thus finding a way to combat is of great significance to our society, and the world at large. No one is immune to depression, although some people may be more predisposed to it than others, depression is a condition that can affect anyone in some point in their life. Although it is a condition of the mind, depression is also often accompanied by physical symptoms such as fatigue, inability to focus or perform tasks that were easy before. According to National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), depression one of the most common mental disorders in the U.S., with an estimate of 16.2 million people experiencing depression, and out of those 10.3 million adults had depression with severe impairment.

Adults experiencing episodes of depression tend to shy away from actively seeking help due to what they are experiencing psychologically. NIMH indicates that 37% of adults with depression did not receive any treatment. This indicates that a large number of people may be experiencing grave and severe symptoms, without any help. So a question arises, how can we help diagnose depression in those people who do not actively seek out a professional?

Researchers at MIT found a way to use neural networks to recognize speech patterns in people that are indicative in depression. What is unique about this approach is that the model is trained in such a way as to recognize depression based on normal conversation through text or audio, rather than responses to a pre-set questionnaire. Previously Machine Learning has been able to detect depression from question and answer surveys, however, this is novel in that it uses no question and answer input, rather it is based on free flowing conversations. In order to carry out their experiment, the researchers used a set of text, audio and video interviews of patients with mental-health issues. The data set of 142 interactions was taken from the Distress Analysis Interview Corpus. Their model was trained on this data set, and it found that it accurately predicted depression in adults using a context-free method, meaning a method that does not require to ask certain questions - such as 'are you feeling depressed?' Rather it looked at natural, free flowing conversation, picking up complementary cues coming from two modalities - text and audio, while not imposing a constraint on the type of content that was discussed. The model picks up a chain of words or speaking sequences and sees whether these speech patterns are more likely to be found in people who are depressed or those who are not depressed. In this way, it can determine who is likely to be depressed and who is not. Because the model is generalized and does not rely on specific questions to be asked - the hope is that this AI model can be implemented into mobile apps that will allow people to detect depression through natural conversation and help those who do not actively seek treatment.",None
"There are a few mistakes that happen during job interviews that can hurt your chances of getting the job. The trouble is that most of the time you aren’t aware you’re making them. What three behaviors do you need to look out for?

Telling the interviewer what you think they want to hear.

It can be tempting to tell the employer what you think they want to hear, but this is not the way to get the job. Your assumptions could be entirely wrong and cost you the job. You can never know the words an interviewer is looking to hear, but know that they’re always looking for authenticity and sincerity.

You should prepare for an interview by running through answers to potential questions and having an idea of how you’d answer, but your answers shouldn’t be rehearsed to the point that they become monologues. The key is to prepare the idea or outline of what you want to say, and then fill in the details in the interview. This ensures that you cover the key points you want to make while infusing your voice and personality into your answers.

Let your personality show through in the interview. The interviewer already knows about your qualifications from reading your resume, but what they don’t know is you as a person. The interview is your time to prove that you’re the right fit for the job both in terms of qualifications and personality.

Not asking questions at the end of the interview.

You must have questions prepared to ask at the end of the interview. Asking questions serves as another way to show your interest in the company. You’ll want to make a list of five to ten questions. Having multiple questions prepared helps to make sure you’ll still have a question to ask even if most of them get answered during the interview. It’s better to be overprepared than to be left at the end of the interview with nothing to ask.

If all of your questions have been answered during the interview, you can tell your interviewer that. Don’t stop there though, you’ll still need to ask a question. A great question to ask on the fly is to have your interviewer elaborate on something the told you during the interview. Asking ‘You mentioned xxx, could you tell me a little more about that?’ will show that you were actively listening and are interested in the position. Whether all of your prepared questions were answered or not, this is a great question to ask.

The key is to ask questions that can’t be answered by going on their website or running a quick google search. Asking questions that are too simple will actually hurt your chances of getting the job, as it can make you seem unprepared. All interviewers expect you to come to the interview having done some research on the company and the position itself, so you can always ask questions clarifying something you’ve read about.

Nerves manifest in multiple ways, and body language is one of the most common. You may find yourself shifting in your seat, playing with a button on your jacket, or cracking your knuckles. These behaviors often emerge when you’re nervous, which is why you might do one or all of these things in an interview even if you wouldn’t normally do them.

There are some basic body language rules you must follow – sit up straight, make eye contact, and don’t fidget. Not making eye contact makes you appear less confident and not trustworthy. Fidgeting in your seat makes you seem unfocused. Everything you do in an interview, both spoken and unspoken, makes an impression.

If you find yourself tapping your foot or shifting in your seat, consciously place both feet on the floor. That helps you ground yourself and stay still. The same thing goes for your hands. Fold your hands in your lap to keep them still. This looks professional, and as an added bonus it will also help you sit up straighter.

By going into your interview aware of these potential mistakes, you’ll be far less likely to make them.",None
"With the tremendous increase in private wealth, family offices are multiplying. A substantial number of the super-rich (net worth = $500 million or more) and those somewhat less affluent are setting up single-family offices. “It’s mainly about extreme customization, control, and the ability to generate tremendous leverage,” says Angelo Robles, founder and CEO of the Family Office Association and author of Effective Family Office. “Still, some incredibly wealthy families have opted to go a different way and not set up their own family office.”

For some of the extremely wealthy and those a lot less affluent, single-family offices can prove cost-inefficient compared to other alternatives. Today, high-quality multi-family offices are very attractive to many wealthy families.

According to Michael Gold, president and CEO of Gold Family Wealth, “We’re seeing affluent families across the wealth spectrum who find a holistic approach to their wealth and family lives really appealing. They want the advantages of a single-family office without the expense and possible managerial headaches. Our ability to customize our offerings and being able to deliver the expertise once restricted to single-family offices is what the wealthy want.”

Well-run multi-family offices can indeed match many of the qualities and deliverables of high-functioning single-family offices. That is why many super-rich families, for instance, are choosing to engage these multi-family offices in place of or in addition to their single-family offices. For these extremely wealthy families, the single-family office option is presently not a very good match for their needs, wants, and preferences. If nothing else, the multi-family office proves to be a very good intermediary step if not the optimal solution.

Because of effort, resources including technology and talent that are becoming common among the better-managed multi-family offices, the ability to deliver the results – many times – only available to the super-rich is now available to many more affluent families. “We’ve developed the methodologies and approaches that have helped democratize the power of high-functioning single family offices,” says Ted Byer, managing partner of Premier Lifestyle Services a division of Smolin, Lupin & Co. “We can now provide the equivalent results of a high-performing single family office to entrepreneurs, athletes, and entertainers and do so very cost effectively.”

Single-family offices can deliver outstanding value and attention to their families. However, a single-family office is not the answer for all wealthy families and individuals. Sometimes, the best answer is a multi-family office. And today, many extremely wealthy families and those of less affluence can get the same results, including the same level of service using a multi-family office, as they would receive if they had a single-family office.",None
"Leadership comes with an array of perks and recognition. Embracing a role as a leader entails that you're going to make an impact on a number of people. However, leadership isn't without its drawbacks that often times crushes someone.

With leadership comes added stress, pressure, and responsibilities, But, there is one habit that rises above all and serves as the biggest threat to a leaders success. This habit is the myth of martyrdom. If you buy into this myth, you will be crushed by your own success.

As Kevin Lawrence described in his book Your Oxygen Mask First , the myth of martyrdom is the belief that you don't have enough time to do the things you want to do:

You believe there is literally no time in your life to take proper care of yourself, to indulge in activities that are just for you, and you alone. You believe as a leader, a spouse, a parent, a community organizer--whatever combination of roles you play--that these roles far outweigh your own personal needs. The myth of martyrdom is the dark lie that makes leaders feel guilty for having human needs.

If you're starting to feel lethargic and dragged down by your business, avoid leadership martyrdom by committing to these two habits.

If you're bombarded with questions each day from your team requesting your opinion, asked the same questions repeatedly, involved in numerous small decisions, and regularly get stuck dealing with other people's issues--then you've created a dependency.

As Lawrence describes in the book: ""Your ego loves to answer questions and solve problems, but you're doing yourself and your team a major disservice if this is how you spend your days.""

Handling a plethora of these minor and daily issues eventually takes its toll on your long-term well being. To get your team acting more independently, treat them like entrepreneurs.

To improve the chances of your team buying into this new philosophy, share your companies vision along with what you envision they become throughout the process.

High performers like LeBron James, Serena Williams, Kevin Durant, Richard Branson, and many others aren't succeeding alone. In fact, they have a team of advisors who are contributing to their mission.

"Rather than requiring less short-term information, the key to combating short-termism is to encourage companies to share more information about their long-term plans. Analysis of companies that have done so suggests that long-term plans are not mere marketing presentations or “cheap talk.” Larger capital market reactions for both stock prices and trading volumes during the course of the event suggests that the information presented during the event is new and value-relevant for investors. As such, the long-term plan can be a valuable addition to the investor relations tool kit to enable CEOs to effectively communicate with long-term investors.

Many people have suggested moving away from quarterly earnings reporting as a way to reduce short-termism. But such a change would probably not change how resources are allocated or businesses operate. Rather than requiring less short-term information, we believe the key to combating short-termism is to encourage companies to share more information about their long-term plans.

When asked why companies don’t talk more about the long term, CEOs often complain about the short-term orientation of investors. Similarly, investors complain that companies don’t disclose enough long-term information for them to work with. This conundrum is finally being tackled by the Strategic Investor Initiative of CECP, a CEO-level organization where one of us works. CECP has created a framework for CEOs to present the long-term strategic plans for their companies and hosts CEO Investor Forums in which to do so. To date, 19 CEOs of S&P 500 companies — such as Becton Dickinson, AETNA, 3M, PG&E, and Unilever — have presented their plans to institutional investors representing in excess of $25 trillion in assets under management. Tomorrow, another three companies — IBM, NRG Energy, and GSK — are presenting their long-term plans. The expectations for an effective long-term plan are described in SII’s Investor Letter to CEOs. Signed by leading institutional investors, the letter describes the components of a long-term plan that enables a CEO to address enduring issues of investor interest and help plug an unmet market need for information with a long-term time horizon.

CEOs have shown leadership in presenting these long-term plans; however, to date, we have not had evidence on the capital market consequences that the presentation of a long-term plan may have. We have been asked by presenting companies, those considering presenting, and other stakeholders to demonstrate real-world impacts from delivering these plans — the “what’s in it for me?” argument for why a company should deliver a long-term plan.

Given this, CECP partnered with KKS Advisors, an advisory and research firm where one of us works and the other is cofounder, to explore the information content of these plans, create a framework analyzing the content of the reports, and examine how capital market participants respond to them. Given the limited sample we have to analyze, we consider our results preliminary. However, they provide important early evidence and can be used in the future as an anchor in analyzing even more companies, as well as the long-term effects from the presentations of these plans. We collected all company strategic plans that have been presented at the CEO Investor Forum over the past four events and analyzed the subsequent returns and trading volume to understand whether there are abnormal movements in the market on the day of the event and the three-to-five-day window following the event.

We find larger capital market reactions both for stock prices and trading volume for the three and five days after the presentation of the long-term plan, compared to the typical reactions on other days, suggesting that the long-term plans communicate new information that market participants did not have before. These data also suggest that long-term plans are not mere marketing presentations or “cheap talk.” However, we find no increased propensity for Wall Street analysts to revise their forecasts in response to a long-term plan, consistent with such analysts being primarily focused on the type of short-term financial results typically delivered through the earnings call. Despite the latter finding, larger capital market reactions for both stock prices and trading volumes during the course of the event suggests that the information presented during the event is new and value-relevant for investors — that is, they are acting on it. As such, the long-term plan can be a valuable addition to the investor relations’ tool kit to enable CEOs to effectively communicate with structurally long-term investors.

We have also analyzed the content of each of the long-term strategic plans delivered at the CEO Investor Forum according to an analytical framework based on SII’s Investor Letter to CEOs, hundreds of pieces of investor feedback, and the work of collaborative initiatives, such as FCLT’s 10 elements of a long-term strategy. We then scored the quality of disclosure based on whether there is no disclosure, generic disclosure, backward-looking metrics, or forward-looking metrics for a category. A good long-term plan provides the investor with forward-looking metrics on several issues — not a generic narrative based on backward-looking information. The categories include 22 specific issues grouped into nine distinct themes: financial performance, capital allocation, industry and mega-trends, competitive positioning, risks and opportunities, corporate governance, corporate purpose, human capital, and strategic partnerships for long-term value creation.

This framework helps us analyze the content of each long-term plan presented to date — and gives us the basis for analysis of future plans. For example, plans for Becton Dickinson and Medtronic score at the top of the distribution. They are rich, specific, and actionable. Companies seem to find it easier to disclose more forward-looking metrics on themes such as competitive positioning (long-, medium-, and short-term value drivers), trends (sources of competitive advantage), and financial performance (capital efficiency and profitability). By contrast, forward-looking metrics were rarely provided for issues underlying the corporate governance theme. In fact, 58% of companies provided no information on executive compensation and how it is linked to the long-term, and 53% of companies did not disclose anything on their board composition.

Our analysis suggests that companies disclosing more actionable information around competitive positioning, corporate purpose, and the strategic partnerships in their corporate ecosystem had significantly larger market reactions than other companies when they shared their long-term plans. This suggests that, to an extent, plan content (as captured in our framework) does correlate with the capital market reactions to these plans.

We hope that this evidence will start a much-needed discussion among more CEOs to present their own long-term strategic plans, and kick-start a significant reframing of the way companies report and investors consume and act on information. We will continue analyzing the content of these plans; build a database of long-term plan content as a resource for companies, investors, and researchers; and continue to enable leading CEOs to develop best practices in delivering long-term plans. Every publicly listed company should deliver a long-term plan as part of reorienting our capital markets toward the long term.",None
"They're fun perks. But you're wrong if you think granola bars and coffee are what draws employees to a company. The smartest young workers are savvier than that; the real unicorns are looking for  flexible schedules, a sense of bigger purpose, access to mentors and more. If you want to create the culture that will attract and keep top talent, you have to be willing to meet them where they are.

A startup doesn't get off the ground without hard work. There's no such thing as a successful startup that doesn't entail long hours. As seen with the gig economy which has fueled a lot of the economic growth in the last decade, employees really prefer some flexibility in their lives--dropping off and picking up their kids from school, working from any location, flexible work schedules.

Matt Mullenweg, the founder of WordPress, employs what he calls a distributed workplace allowing employees to work from anywhere. Trying to create some sense of flexibility in your employees can yield great results. Keep in mind that I don't mean employees should work outside of the office all the time. However, when employees have autonomy over their schedules and lives, it results in a greater commitment to your company and culture, longer-tenured and happier employees.

Whether your potential employees are some of the 64 million Americans living in multi-generational households or are just starting out on their own, companies, both Fortune 500 and mom-and-pop shops alike, can aim to offer benefits within their means. As with flexible work arrangements, benefits such as eldercare, adoption, on-site daycare, infertility treatments, and domestic partner benefits go a long way in helping employees who are at various life stages. You want your workers to feel appreciated and respected and recognizing where they are in life is a start.

Investing in your employees doesn't take much effort, whether it's recognizing their work anniversary, providing learning and development opportunities or giving a gift card. Who wouldn't love an additional five days of vacation on their fifth-year work anniversary or the chance to expand their knowledge and skills? Companies are doing really cool things in the learning and development space including online learning courses that don't have to break the company bank.

It's my number-one piece of advice for entrepreneurs, and it should be yours for your employees. For me, when I was starting LearnVest, finding mentors was important because I needed people to tell it to me straight and push me harder by not sugar-coating what I was doing wrong. Lee Barba, former Chairman of Thinkorswim, would push me early on that we weren't focusing enough on our technology strategy. As a result, I made it my number one focus, so that it became where I put 50 percent of my time and energy. That resulted in my company being acquired.

From the perspective of your bottom line, your employees should have a clear-cut avenue for seeking out mentors. And you should help them find those mentors by making the process easy and allowing time for mentor meetings in your employees' work days. The best mentors will give honest feedback that gets results because it comes without the pressure of a boss-employee relationship. If you don't believe your bonus is on the line, you're going to react to constructive criticism less emotionally than if you're panicked about your income for the year.

Oh, and while you're at it, make sure your mentors -- or, as I like to call them, the advisors on your board -- are in place, too. No business will grow and thrive without them.

5. Hire the Smartest and the Best

Nothing is more powerful or important than what Netflix once dubbed stunning colleagues. When you're surrounded by smart and talented people, you feel as if you're learning and growing every day at work. And, there's nothing like creating an environment of excellence where employees feel they can thrive.

Take this advice a step further -- and hire people who are even smarter than you are. Entrepreneurship isn't an ego boost; in order to succeed, you need to accept, expect and cultivate criticism. Make it clear to your employees that they can tell it to you straight and that ""yes"" isn't the answer you're always looking for.",communication
"If you're a  billionaire who owns Virgin Airlines, it may seem like you don't need to spend too much time working. That is especially true if you own your own private island.

For Richard Branson, that's just his life. Plus, he's often said he loves what he does so much that it doesn't feel like work at all.

The same can't be said for Branson's views on other people's work habits, especially those of employees. Compared to many vocal entrepreneurs, he has a pretty liberal view of the workweek. Branson believes in the ""less is more"" approach when it comes to work hours, recently explaining that most people would be better suited to invest less time in their job, in favor of having more overall flexibility.

However, in Branson's view, it's not about hours worked but the quality of those working hours. And with modern technology, working remotely and putting in fewer hours is becoming more possible than ever before.

His thoughts on how to make employees more productive and happier: give them a three- or even four-day weekend. Do I agree? Of course. Who in their right mind would disagree with this?

Where I disagree is who is responsible for this. It's not the company's responsibility. Employees should be responsible for making themselves happier and more productive.

The more it's built into the culture, the more your team will do it all on their own, without waiting around for a manager to notice they're burning out. Here are three ways you can make that happen, starting today:

1. Teach your employees how to say no.

There is value in instilling a Branson-inspired rule. However, not many people would follow it. They'd still work on Fridays. They just won't tell anyone.

It's kind of like in college, where that one really smart kid who says he doesn't study is the one in the library until 3 a.m. every night. Your employees own their schedules, not you.

The best leaders encourage employees to stand up for their own happiness and say ""no."" Make sure your team knows they won't get reprimanded for standing up to their workloads.

2. Give your team less work and more direction.

The best managers I've ever worked with gave me very specific direction on what they wanted me to achieve, and when they wanted me to achieve it. They praised me on the quality of my work, not the quantity of my work.

They were also great at not assigning random stuff to do every morning. Fewer emergencies meant more time to do better work. You know what happened if they did give me too much work? I literally promised to do less work, and they appreciated it.

It's hard to remember every single thing you did last week. Do you think your boss knows what you did all week? Not a chance.

All she knows is what you promised you'd do, and what you actually got done. See where I'm going with this? If your team members promise less, they will actually get more done.

3. Have your team plan for six hours of work a day, not 10.

It's amazing that you can look at your checklist in the morning and think it's all doable, but by the time its 5 p.m., you're only 20 percent of the way there. The office distractions easily get in the way.",wellness
"September 18th, 2018 was just another game day in a long season for the Baltimore Orioles baseball team. But for some fans it was a groundbreaking moment they will remember for decades.

The Orioles are located in Baltimore, which is also home to the NFB. If you aren't immediately aware of what that acronym stands for, don't worry, you're not alone. The National Federation of the Blind (NFB) moved to Baltimore forty years ago.

They became the first team in professional sports to wear braille jerseys, include braille roster cards, and to even televise their home team starting lineup entirely in braille.

While fans weren't able to actually touch the jerseys, this statement made a heartfelt and touching moment for many of the blind fans who were honored at the game.

Aside from being incredibly courageous and helping to raise awareness for a great cause, this gets to a deeper truth on how companies can do similar activities to build their brand as well as reach more audiences. After this move, the Baltimore Orioles now have a new cheering section, even as the worst team in baseball this year.

Not only is this a genius move by the Orioles, but something all business owners and entrepreneurs can learn from. Here are a few.

The best businesses don't always follow the money.

The idea that blind fans can only experience the game via radio broadcast makes them fringe customers at best. They definitely aren't a major contributor to the Orioles' box office numbers.

However, this was an ethically motivated and altruistic move that I think is going to pay off in the long run for the Orioles. For longtime fans of the team, it reinforces their loyalty and the reason they love them in the first place. For fans new to the mystery inside Camden Yards, former home of legend Cal Ripken Jr., this is just one more reason for them to support the team.

Even more widespread, this is a good look for Major League Baseball, who's fans now have access to bid on the signed game-used jerseys for between $300-$1,000.

It's not always about how great your product is.

I run into so many entrepreneurs who can't stop talking about how great their product is or why their clients need them, but they gloss over the culture of the company and the positive impact it can have on how their customers view them.

As our culture seeks to raise awareness and inclusiveness for great causes, it's important we give recognition to people who are different than ourselves, even if we don't mention our product in the process.

The reality is that talented musicians, skilled lawyers, professionals, academics, mothers, fathers, sons, and daughters are blind. By rallying around this cause, the impact reaches far wider than just baseball fans. It's a win-win for everyone involved.

Stand up for what you believe in and the customers will follow.

Nike's Kaepernick marketing campaign is a great example of a company that stood up for what it believed in. Of course, it was a calculated decision, but the employees behind the campaign truly believed in the cause, and business skyrocketed because of it.",None
"Tuition costs continue to soar, outpacing inflation in most categories over the past few decades, but some colleges are finally making higher education more affordable.

St. John’s College, a private school with campuses in Maryland and New Mexico, is the latest to make such a move, slashing tuition by $17,000 a year. The school plans to make the money up through fundraising. According to a news release, St. John’s will lower tuition from $52,000 to $35,000 by raising $300 million to offset the revenue loss. The plan is set to go into effect in 2019.

“This is highly relevant to the trending topic of the tuition crisis, and St. John’s is taking a stance on prestige pricing, saying that enough is enough,” the college stated in an email announcing the plan.

A college official said the move was made because students and families have been stretched to the max on what they can afford to pay for an education.

“We believe the days when students and families could pay exorbitant tuition prices are gone and they aren’t coming back—nor should they—and we are placing philanthropy at the center of our financial model rather than student-derived revenue to ensure we remain strong financially as a college,” Mark Roosevelt, president of the St. John's College system, told Inside Higher Ed.

The price break is an anomaly in a higher education environment where costs keep climbing. According to a 2013 U.S. Government Accountability Office report, tuition and fees rose by 89% from 2002 to 2012.

While unique, St. Johns is not alone in scaling down tuition. In August both Robert Morris University and Oglethorpe University announced price-matching programs in an effort to compete with state flagship schools. Robert Morris is competing only with Pennsylvania schools for state residents, while Oglethorpe is open to all, meaning students can expect to pay anywhere from $18,499 to $5,500, depending on where they call home.

Others include University of the Cumberlands, which is trimming tuition by 57%; Elizabethtown College, which is cutting costs by 32% percent, Stephens College, and Elmira College, just to name a few.

A University of the Cumberlands official told local newspaper the News Journal that the move would ease the burden of student debt for graduates of the institution.

“As someone who speaks to students each day about college finances, including student loans and managing that debt beyond college, it is exciting to think of the opportunity our students and families have with this tuition reduction plan,” Larry Rector, director of Financial Aid said. “From this point forward, this university can send college graduates into the world with the financial peace of mind not available to many of their peers.”

Elizabethtown College President Carl Strikwerda said the tuition cut will attract more students who would not previously have considered the school based on the costs.

“They don’t even apply because the tuition is so high,” Strikwerda told Lancaster Online.

While tuition resets are rare, the flurry of recent announcements detailing plans to do so, suggests that the strategy is gaining in popularity. Similarly, last fall also saw a number of small, private colleges scaling back costs.",None
"In today's economy, you would be hard pressed to find a business owner who doesn't experience some level of anxiety surrounding the fate of their business. But for many entrepreneurs, anxiety can be a real hurdle that makes growth and progress difficult.

Take for example Joaquin (name changed to respect his privacy), a business owner with a consumer products company. When we first started coaching Joaquin, he struggled with terrible anxiety. His business was growing quickly, but his uncertainty and fear had really begun to get in the way of his growth. He was regularly turning down contracts for fear of production backlogs and he was beginning to experience physical and mental burnout.

Our first session together, he showed up in a wrinkled button-down shirt and fidgeted constantly. He looked tired and overworked. His ideas were all over the place, and he struggled to focus for more than a few minutes at a time throughout the hour-long session. It was clear that he needed help.

1. Take control of your business.

Like many business owners, Joaquin played an active role in his business. He had his hands in almost every job function and struggled to delegate tasks to his employees.

So we began the process by having him write down every single thing he did over the course of a week. We then looked for places where he could free up his time by creating a series of processes and systems and delegated tasks, where appropriate.

As a consumer goods manufacturer, Joaquin struggled with production and operations. So the first set of systems we set up were:

Once these were in place, he was able to take his focus away from the ""what ifs"" and fine-tune the process until he felt comfortable taking on new contracts.

Now, Joaquin already spent a lot of his time thinking about what could go wrong in his business. So we addressed the elephant in the room surrounding some key decisions that he was putting off, with one simple question:

He was going back and forth about whether to buy a $500,000 piece of manufacturing equipment that would triple his productivity. So I challenged him to think about the worst-case scenario.

He paused for a minute and then replied ""Well, yes.... As long as we take care of the machine, I should be able to sell it for about 90 percent of what I paid for it new.""

Last but not least, we made self-care a priority for Joaquin. Now, this isn't about spa days and shopping sprees, it's about taking time out for your own mental and physical growth.",None
"Getting your morning office routine off to a productive start is often the most challenging part of the work day. For most of us, it is the critical difference between getting that ""to do"" list done or feeling the stress of undone tasks.

Benjamin Stall and Michael Xander, the cofounders of My Morning Routine and authors of My Morning Routine: How Successful People Start Every Day Inspired, recently chronicled the habits of successful executives ""referencing the time between waking up and either leaving your home, or transitioning to the next part of your day.""

It's counter-intuitive, but often that golden hour that gets your day off to the right start, especially for working moms, is at the office and not at home. No matter your role within the workplace, especially when balancing a busy personal life, those first moments can be critical.

Besides the obvious musts of getting up early, organizing your day, placing urgent calls and answering critical emails, five founders, many of whom are working moms, shared key habits that help them de-stress and manage their day better in a highly digital world.

Transition And Breathe. Shirin von Wulffen, cofounder of Bastide, the beauty and lifestyle collection inspired by the wellness philosophy of Provence and founded on a commitment to clean, toxin-free living shared that ""just getting comfortable, sipping a warm drink, and arranging my desk so it feels good to me."" helps her settle in.  Then von Wulffen checks her schedule, her husband's and the kids' schedule to make sure she has all loose ends covered while staying away from email and social media for the first 20 minutes so that she can plan her day before it just comes rushing at her.""

Von Wulffen added, that her ""Favorite hack for starting the day on the right foot, comes from my good friend and yoga instructor, Hannah Casey. She always tells me 'to smile inside and send a wave of gratitude through your body'. I know it sounds silly but it really works!""

Connect And Disconnect. This might seem old school but it is actually an important trend in our increasingly demanding digital world. Joanna Griffiths, founder and CEO of knix, a brand that’s reinventing intimates for real life with multi-tasking bras, underwear and other first layer pieces that directly address real women’s needs, starts her morning work routine by first ""saying hello to the team."" Griffiths' mentor encouraged her ""to set the tone for the office and be sure to start the day off right and be a friendly face to the team as its one of the most important things you can do.""

After that, Griffiths carves out at least 30 minutes of alone time to map out her day and ideally get one or two pressing things crossed off the list. She tends to do the most mentally intensive work at the start of the day when her brain is fresh. So whether it's reviewing a contract or making a pricing decision, Griffiths likes to get one to two big things done.

If you travel a lot in your work, it is equally important to stay connected. Bouchra Ezzahraoui, co-founded AUrate in 2015, disrupting the traditional fine jewelry model by offering modern, essential pieces made from ethically-sourced high-quality materials at an accessible price point. Along with many executives, she is often on the road and away from the office.

Bouchra Ezzahraoui follows a similar model as Griffiths of knix. The first thing she does when she in in the office is talk to her team. Ezzahraoui shared that she often travels with cofounder Sophie Kahn, but ""when we're here, it's all about personal interaction. In fact, in this digital day and age, the only reason you even really need an office anymore is for the human component— to see and feel how the team is doing, look people in their eyes, feel the atmosphere, have the tough talks or the fun talks, and then work together. That's what the office is all about for me.""

Set Priorities And Stay Focused. Anu Duggal, founding partner of Female Founders Fund, an early stage investment fund that invests in startups with female founding members, starts every morning with a quick mental review of the three most important things that need to get done that day. Their mission is to promote the growth of female entrepreneurs by bringing together founders, CEOs and industry experts to raise money and time for companies with exceptional female talent. For Dugal, ""Answering emails, taking meetings, and unexpected phone calls are all part of her day, but making sure that she stays focus on three key objectives for the day enables Dugal to focus and prioritize her time in the most productive way.""

Eunice Byun, cofounder and CEO of Material, has created a new category of tasteful kitchenware, designed and curated for modern home cooks which is on a mission to create beautiful, well-designed tools that inspire beautiful memories in the kitchen, around the table and in your home. Byun has a similar approach to her day.

Every morning, Byun physically writes out the five most important things she would like to accomplish. Elaborating on her routine Byun explained, ""There's something about writing it out that helps me focus and prioritize, so that regardless of whatever pops up throughout the day (of which there are many items when you are running your own company), I can ensure those five things get done before I call it a day. I also find that it forces me to keep thinking through our strategic priorities as opposed to simply focusing on task after task, since checklists can get long and unwieldy.""

Multi-Task And Pivot. Finally, not everyone has an office routine especially when you're in a retail or operational role, being out in the marketplace is a critical part of what you do. Christina Stembel, is the founder and CEO of Farmgirl Flowers, the e-commerce flower company that promotes sustainability and minimizes environmental waste by changing the way flowers are purchased by offering fewer, better options and providing a superior customer service experience, has a completely different routine.

When Stembel gets to work she spend 30 seconds taking out her hair rollers in the car and then heads into the warehouse to do a quick check in with the operations managers to make sure there aren't any fires brewing or issues have already been resolved. Next, Stembel checks her email and spend 30 minutes responding to the most urgent ones. Then the day's meetings start and she doesn't check emails again until the end of the day or on quick breaks in meetings.

One last caveat Stembel might just be the most important habit to embrace before plunging into your workday. Stembel shared ""Not checking my e-mail until I get into the office is a newer habit. I find it helps me be less stressed out in the morning in general - it feels almost luxurious. That's the time that no one gets me the whole day.  I get to wake up, get ready and drive in without worrying about the to-do list that's growing in my inbox. It's counter-intuitive, but my commute time is my relaxation time.",None
"Absurdly Driven looks at the world of business with a skeptical eye and a firmly rooted tongue in cheek.

You'll never hear all the stories about everything that goes on within airlines.

If even half of the ones I've heard are true -- and I fear 90 percent of them are -- you won't want to hear at least half of them.

The latest -- and weightiest -- to fly across my firmament involves American Airlines.

One of the airline's pilots believes that the airline is flying people to Hawaii, but then is unable to fly all those people back again.

In a recent edition of the internal airline Q&A known as Crew News -- reported by View From The Wing's Gary Leff -- a pilot said this to American's president Robert Isom:

From my understanding, we leave people in Hawaii every day because the Airbus can't make it back to Phoenix with a full load. Is that our plan to take people somewhere where we can't bring them all back?

The issue involves weight restrictions imposed on airlines for twin-engined planes that spend a long time over water.

Bigger twin-engine planes such as the Boeing 757 don't have a problem. Indeed, Isom explained to the pilot that the airline will keep some of these older planes precisely for the purpose of trying to not leave passengers behind.

I asked the airline whether it really is flying people over to Hawaii and leaving them there.

Weight restrictions do not occur each day, but can be based on temperature and if the runway is wet. For example, on extremely hot days in Phoenix, we could take weight restrictions as well.

Ah, so those who complain that passengers are bumped for weight reasons -- the plane's, not theirs -- may be telling the truth?

We also compensate for this [potential weight issue] by reducing the number of seats we sell. For example, on LIH-LAX [Kauai's Lihue Airport to Los Angeles], we are only selling 137 seats even though the aircraft has 165. This way, we ensure we don't have to remove passengers and reroute them back to LAX another way.

The mere thought that there might be seats that aren't being sold must make them recoil like snakes encountering an especially large mongoose.",None
"There are thousands of mentoring programs in this country, yet no one has challenged business leaders to individually mentor the nine million youth who have no caring adult in their lives. That's a call for nine million of America's business leaders to step up and lead where it counts.

I'm not talking about mentoring junior employees. I'm talking about low-income inner city high school kids. They need help getting to and through college. They need help getting a skilled credential leading to employment. Help, and you will lift someone out of poverty and change the trajectory of their life. I know firsthand, from my 22 years as chairman and CEO of a foundation that works to level the playing field for underserved youth, that mentoring is a guarantee in terms of effective interventions that can and do make an impact. Young adults who are at risk for falling off-track but have a mentor are 55 percent more likely to enroll in college.

Mentoring is one of the best investments in your company that you can make, too--because your employees will follow suit. Offer opportunities for them to engage in socially-responsible mentoring programs and watch their engagement and job satisfaction, which are top predictors of high performance, productivity, and profitability, soar. Multiple researchers have shown that when organizations offer corporate social responsibility opportunities like mentoring, they are more likely to have employees who work cooperatively within their own company, have a greater sense of identity with the company they work for, are more likely to remain with the company, and perform better.

As Bob Stiller, founder of Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, has said, ""I've learned that people are motivated and more willing to go the extra mile to make the company successful when there's a higher good associated with it. It's no longer just a job. Work becomes meaningful and this makes us more competitive."" Creating a mentoring opportunity for your employees will create a culture that not only attracts new talent but gives them a reason to stay.

And what if your company's future talent pool included candidates pulled from a more diverse pipeline, one that included more first-generation graduates who had been helped to and through college by a mentor much like yourself? This, you know, is also in your company's best long-term interest. We can't afford to let any talent lay undeveloped and untapped.

If you think you don't have time, you are wrong. Everyone has time for a text, email, or phone call and, believe it or not, that is most often what I have found a mentee needs: someone to be available and responsive. The content of your response is, of course, important but you have years of experience and a perspective that helped to get you where you are today. That will be enough for starters. When I have not known enough about an issue or a concern raised by a mentee, I did what you, too, have done in your business career and sought the guidance of others more knowledgeable than me.

I've mentored numerous students over the course of my career. The most successful mentorships have been those in which our expectations are agreed upon from the start. I help with college essays, resumes, elevator pitches, and interview techniques. My mentees are expected to communicate with me regularly about their lives and, specifically, their challenges.

Those challenges can be big, but they can also be small. Consider Isabella, a shy inner-city high school student attending a residential summer enrichment program at a private college. She only has one outfit to wear. The problem? Her jeans are always damp. She washes them in her sink at night but the coin changers for the dryers in her dorms are out of change. She has never been to a college campus and is scared to ask for help. She's at risk of dropping out of the program over something like this. But she has a mentor. She texts her mentor for help. Within minutes, the mentor locates a bodega within walking distance to the dorms, where Isabella will feel comfortable asking for change. Yes, it can be that easy to help your mentee overcome barriers.

Mentoring will lead to opportunities for your own personal growth that you can't possibly foresee, to experiences and rewards you can't anticipate. The essence of a mentorship is constancy and trust. It's a commitment to care about another person enough to be an ear to listen and a guide to advise them. It's about providing advice and stability in a world that often lacks both.

There are multiple ways to seek out a mentorship role. There are young people you will find along the way who you can naturally take under your wing. There are also programs that will match you with students. Try one of these:

If your company doesn't yet offer a corporate social responsibility program, start one and seriously consider grounding it in programs that facilitate mentoring low-income youth. You should do this, and you can. Do it for yourself, for those who look up to you to lead, and for those who will be lifted out of poverty by your hand.",communication
"Great managers consistently engage their teams to achieve outstanding performance. They create environments where employees take responsibility for their own -- and their team's -- engagement and build workplaces that are engines of productivity and profitability.

But not every team is led by a great manager. That's why managers account for at least 70% of the variance in employee engagement scores across business units, Gallup estimates in the State of the American Manager: Analytics and Advice for Leaders.

This variation is in turn responsible for severely low worldwide employee engagement. As Gallup has reported, only 30% of U.S. employees are engaged at work, and a staggeringly low 13% worldwide are engaged. Worse, over the past 12 years, these low numbers have barely budged, meaning that the vast majority of employees worldwide are failing to develop and contribute at work.

Gallup has studied performance at hundreds of companies and measured the engagement of 27 million employees and more than 2.5 million work units over the past two decades. No matter the industry, size or location, companies are struggling to unlock the mystery of why performance varies from one workgroup to the next. Performance fluctuates widely and unnecessarily in most companies, in no small part from the lack of consistency in how people are managed.

Companies can attack this problem by measuring what matters most. Gallup has discovered links between employee engagement at the business-unit level and vital performance indicators, including customer ratings; higher profitability, productivity and quality (fewer defects); lower turnover; less absenteeism and shrinkage (i.e., theft); and fewer safety incidents. When a company raises employee engagement levels consistently across every business unit, everything gets better.

To make this happen, companies must demand that every team in their workforce have a great manager. After all, the root of performance variability lies within human nature itself. Teams are composed of individuals with diverging needs related to morale, motivation and clarity -- all of which lead to varying degrees of performance. Nothing less than great managers can maximize them.

But first, companies have to find those great managers.

If great managers seem scarce, it's because the talent required to be one is rare. Talents are innate and are the building blocks of great performance. Knowledge, experience and skills develop our talents into strengths, but unless people possess the right innate talents for our job, no amount of training or experience will lead to exceptional performance.

Gallup's research reveals that about one in 10 people possess high talent to manage. Though many people are endowed with some of the necessary traits, few have the unique combination of talents needed to help a team achieve excellence in a way that significantly improves a company's performance. These 10%, when put in manager roles, naturally engage team members and customers, retain top performers and sustain a culture of high productivity.

Gallup has also found that another two in 10 people exhibit some characteristics of functioning managerial talent and can function at a high level if their company invests in coaching and developmental plans for them. In studying managerial talent in supervisory roles compared with the general population, Gallup finds that organizations have learned how to slightly improve the odds of finding talented managers. Nearly one in five (18%) of those currently in management roles demonstrate a high level of talent for managing others, while another two in 10 show a basic talent for it. Combined, they contribute about 48% higher profit to their companies than average managers do.

But companies miss the mark on high managerial talent in 82% of their hiring decisions. This is an alarming problem for employee engagement and the development of high-performing cultures in the U.S. and worldwide.

Yes, every manager can learn to engage a team somewhat. But without the raw natural talent to individualize, focus on each person's needs and strengths, boldly review his or her team members, rally people around a cause, and execute efficient processes, the day-to-day experience will burn out both the manager and his or her team. This basic inefficiency in identifying talent costs companies billions of dollars annually.

Conventional selection processes are a big contributor to inefficiency in management practices; they apply little science or research to find the right person for the managerial role. When Gallup asked U.S. managers why they believed they were hired for their current role, they commonly cited their success in a previous non-managerial role or their tenure in their company or field.

These reasons don't take into account whether the candidate has the right talent to thrive in the role. Being a successful programmer, salesperson or engineer, for example, is no guarantee that someone will be adept at managing others.

Most companies promote workers into managerial positions because of tenure or performance, rather than talent. This practice doesn't work. Experience and skills are important, but people's talents -- the naturally recurring patterns in the ways they think, feel and behave -- predict where they'll perform at their best.

It's important to note that finding great managers doesn't depend on market conditions or the current labor force. Large companies have approximately one manager for every 10 employees, and Gallup finds that one in 10 people possess the inherent talent to manage. When you do the math, it's likely that someone on each team has the talent to lead -- but chances are, it's not the manager. More than likely, it's an employee with high managerial potential waiting to be discovered.

The good news is that sufficient management talent exists in every company. Leaders should maximize this potential by choosing the right person for the next management role using predictive analytics to guide their identification of talent. Specific tools such as talent audits and talent assessments offer a systematic and scientific method for finding those employees who have the natural talent to be great managers.",coaching
"In our hyper-connected working world, work-life balance is crucial to employee engagement and career development. The term ""work-life balance"" was first used in the U.K. in the 1970s and later used in the U.S. in the 1980s. When work takes up too much of your time and effort, you’re more likely to experience burnout. On September 26, 2018, Adam Grant tweeted the following in his Wednesday Wisdom:

Perhaps, like me, you’ve also heard the term work-life integration and work-life blend. Like Jeff Bezos, I tend to prefer the term work-life harmony.

Whatever you want to call it, the concept is something that we all have to define for ourselves because there’s no doubt that we need work-life balance. Comparably, a compensation, culture and career-monitoring site, conducted an anonymous survey to determine the best companies for work-life balance. For the companies featured in their ""Best Work-Life Balance"" list, employees were asked a series of questions including: are you satisfied with your work-life balance, how long do you take for lunch breaks and on average, how many hours do you work per day?

The best large companies (500 or more employees) for work-life balance:

The best small to medium size companies (less than 500 employees) for work-life balance:

We still have a way to go. From the top 25 companies, 20% of employees are not satisfied with their work-life balance.

When employees work half an hour less at 8.5 hours as opposed to 9 hours per day, individuals feel that they have greater work-life balance.  A recent survey from Randstad shows that employees also heavily value paid time off. The survey found:

Employees from the top 25 companies in Comparably’s findings average a 47-minute lunch break compared to an average of only 44 minutes for all other employees. It may seem like a small difference, but as Comparably notes, three more minutes on your lunch break equates to more than a day off or 10.5 hours per year.

How can employers apply lessons from the study?

An introspective look at work-life harmony

If you’ve answered yes to more than two of the above questions, or you feel that, as a leader, you can do a better job following suit on Comparably’s best companies for work-life balance, then there is support in the form of coaching, training and speaking. I’m not sure how well we’ve become acquainted, but if you’ve taken a few peeks at what I do, you’ll have sensed a deep commitment and love for all things career-related. As you may have gathered from my other Forbes stories, I’m also keen on asking thoughtful questions. The consequences of burnout are an estimated $125 billion to $190 billion a year in health costs as well as other associated costs such as talent acquisition, engagement and productivity.",wellness
"When I told my team that I wanted us to produce sunscreen, I’m sure some people thought I was crazy. After all, we were a successful beverage company. What did any of us know about the skincare business?

Former first lady Rosalynn Carter once said, “A leader takes people where they want to go. A great leader takes people where they don't necessarily want to go, but ought to be.” Entering a new market took everyone at my business out of our collective comfort zone, but it forced us to learn new things, expand our skill-sets and eventually launch a great new product.

I believe that it’s my duty as a leader to ensure my team spends enough time in a state of “optimal anxiety.” This is a psychological term used to describe how getting out of cruise control and feeling under pressure can increase performance. Anyone who has played competitive sports will know that you need a certain amount of nervous energy to be at your best.

If you want to stretch your team and take them where they may not want to go, here are my five tips.

Optimal anxiety is the sweet spot for better performance, but you have to be careful: too much stress can have a detrimental effect. That’s why it’s good to start small and test how each individual steps out of their comfort zone.

Ask someone to take charge of an internal meeting that you would usually lead. If a team presents a tried and trusted plan, have them explore new ideas to push their strategy further. Nudge people to go against their usual instincts, like urging a naturally cautious person to consider a riskier option.

By starting small, you’ll discover who copes well with new challenges and may be ready to go even further next time.

Last year, I completed the 13.8-mile climb of The Base of the Towers in Patagonia’s Torres del Paine mountain range. It was a real challenge that took me completely out of my hiking comfort zone, but as each step got harder and harder, the simple goal of just getting to the top kept me going.

When people are clear about the end goal of a challenging project, it’s easier to motivate them. A fuzzy purpose can be demotivating when the going gets tough and leave them wondering if it’s worth all the anxiety and pressure.

Setting clear and simple targets will help people visualize the end result and stay focused on what they need to do to get there.

My company’s mission is to make products that satisfy and delight consumers while enabling them to be healthier and happier. Making this clear to the people who work for me gives them a greater sense of purpose than simply selling bottled water. It also helps make sense of us producing a sunscreen and gives my employees additional impetus to overcome the challenges involved.

When people are passionate about what they do, they’re more willing to push themselves into areas where they’re not comfortable. My own desire to make a difference in the world helps me remain in that state of optimal anxiety without tipping over into completely stressed-out.

Give your team a sense of purpose and that mission will sustain them when they’re outside their comfort zone.

When people are first out of comfort zone, they’ll usually need a lot of help and encouragement. Whenever I take my team where they may not want to go, I make sure not to abandon them there by having regular check-ins and prioritizing their emails and messages.

But the extent of your support is also a balancing act. You’re not properly pushing people if you continually give them all the answers. I try to provide guidance and moral support without completely solving my team’s problems.

Make time for support in the beginning, and your team will eventually get to a place where they don’t rely on you as much.

It’s always great to cook that family favorite you’ve prepared a hundred times before. There’s a reason it’s called comfort food! But it’s also fun to play around with new ingredients and techniques, even if it may occasionally result in an inedible mess and a phone call to your local take-out restaurant.

You can’t meet every challenge, especially not the first time. When you’re pushing your team, it’s important they know that failure is not the end of the world. Otherwise, the perceived consequences of not getting it right can turn optimal anxiety into stress and ever-diminishing returns on performance.

By accepting that people will occasionally fail when they try something new, you’ll allow them the freedom to win big.

An optimal mix of comfort and anxiety

Being in your comfort zone isn’t inherently bad. It’s good to dip back in there regularly, so you’re not living in a constant state of anxiety. Not everyone thrives with anxiety, and that’s also ok. Every business needs steady, dependable performers as well as risk-takers.

But to achieve greatness, you need to lead enough people on your team to where they may not want to go. It won’t be easy, but when you achieve that state of optimal anxiety, the results are worth the effort.",None
"At least, every time I'm packing to go to speak at the next conference -- roughly once a week -- I have a secret smile as I leave a spare bit of room in my carry-on for whatever interesting ""swag"" I'll see to bring home with me.

I know I'm not the only one. There are unboxing videos on Youtube and threads on Instagram dedicated to conference giveaways. For some, attending a conference is only worth it for --in the words of The Office's Michael Scott -- the ""Stuff we all get.""

As a business owner, promotional items are a golden opportunity to get your brand into the wild. Finding a product that fits your budget, matches your style, and fits your customer's needs enough for them to use frequently is the holy grail of marketing opportunities.

In the early days of Evernote, we often quipped that we were a t-shirt company instead of a SaaS platform because we spent as much effort on getting our high-quality, limited-edition shirts out into the wild and being worn by people around the world as we did on developing the product. This early awareness campaign worked beautifully though, and we were able to see relevant upticks in usage in each location where we sent the shirts.

Of course, our results were not typical; most companies are unable to see this kind of return from their promotional marketing effort. Additionally, most businesses have no idea how to measure the results they are getting.

Here is how you to fight through the crowds and become the swag everyone wants to get:

Every few months, someone posts a list for marketers of the top 10 promotional items of the season. As far as I can tell, this means that everyone with a budget will go down the list and order something from it. This means that you'll be at a conference with a one in 10 chance that your item will be there with someone else's brand on it.

If someone has limited space in their suitcase, they'll usually take the first one they see - and you'll have lost the opportunity to have your brand in their daily life.

Do you need a stress ball? How about a highlighter with a flashlight? Or how about some stickers? For most people, even though they pick them up from the conference, the actual answer is no.

Instead, think about the things you personally would use on a daily basis. Water bottles, phone charger cables, power banks, etc are all things that I've seen people stand in line and even fight for.

What goals are you trying to reach with your promotional item? Is it to build awareness? Are you trying to convert new users? Or is this a thank-you gift for existing customers?

Depending on what you're trying to accomplish, you can find the right product to fit any budget-- including using a company like Spreadshirt or Printful to create an on-demand shop for people to purchase logo items (instead of you giving them away.)",None
"If asked to identify the most telling signs that an employee is about to quit, many managers would list behaviors like wearing interview attire to the office, or leaving a resume lying around. According to Gardner and Horn, however, the cues are much more subtle. They identified 13 key behaviors that employees typically exhibit before they quit. While no one factor is indicative of turnover, Gardner and Horn found that the more an employee exhibited pre-quitting behaviors, the more likely he was to leave an organization within 12 months. Being able to recognize these 13 behaviors is an essential skill for managers and employees considering leaving their current positions. Managers should use this information to try to retain star employees or put a plan in place for an eventual departure. An employee on the job market should be cognizant of how his behavior may affect his co-workers.

Despite a century of speculation by managers and scholars, we know very little about whether certain cues or signs exhibited by employees can predict whether they’re about to quit.

To help managers and companies identify employees at risk of quitting, we investigated this very question and uncovered a set of behavioral changes exhibited by employees—what we dub pre-quitting behaviors—that are strong predictors of voluntary quits in the 12 months after they are observed by managers. Our inquiry was inspired by a study by evolutionary psychologists David Buss and Todd Shackelford showing that romantic partners give off cues that indicate whether they are committing infidelity. A series of classic studies by psychologist John Gottman supports this, identifying how certain verbal and nonverbal cues expressed by married couples during brief videotaped interactions can forecast their eventual divorce.

But the romantic realm isn’t the only place where cues can take place. Poker players give off “tells” that reveal the strength of their hands, while American football players read their rivals’ behaviors to decide how they will act after the ball is snapped. And research shows that criminals have become savvy at identifying informants or undercover officers in their midst.

To understand how tells might play out in the workplace, we first sought to identify a large set of behavioral changes employees exhibit that signal their future turnover. We asked nearly 100 managers to answer the following question: Think for a moment of the peers and subordinates who have voluntarily quit your organization in the last two years. How was their behavior different in the months prior quitting that might have told you they were on their way out? We also asked 100 employees to describe their own changes in behavior before leaving a previous job. These inquiries yielded over 900 different pre-quitting behaviors. The survey respondents reported relatively odd behavioral changes (e.g., “stopped caring about their personal appearance;” “became aggressive toward other employees”) as well as many common ones (e.g., “less willingness to volunteer for special projects;” “decreased attendance at staff meetings”).

For the next phase of the research, we edited and pruned the list of 900+ behaviors into a structured 116-item questionnaire. We administered this provisional survey to three additional samples of managers. The first set of managers rated how often previous leavers enacted these behaviors before quitting. Half of the 116 behaviors were eliminated because they occurred infrequently (e.g., “They asked co-workers for contacts at other companies;” “They exhibited sudden and frequent changes in their mood”). We then circulated this reduced survey to another group of managers who rated how often their current subordinates exhibit these actions. We next analyzed these ratings and isolated a cluster of 13 highly correlated behaviors that best represent employees’ proclivity toward near-future voluntary turnover. Finally, we double-checked this finding by asking one more group of managers to describe their employees’ behaviors with the final 13-item survey.

The pre-quitting behaviors that made the cut are below:

The most interesting take-away from this second phase of our research were the behaviors that did not survive our screening process. Note that the 13 key behaviors do not include “wearing dressier clothes to work,” “leaving a resume on the printer,” or “missing work for doctors’ appointments more frequently than usual.”  These and many similar behaviors, which have entered into managers’ folklore of key signs of impending departure, were rarely observed or did not statistically hang together with the core behaviors representing a general predilection to quit. Such behaviors may predict future turnover, but not as consistently as the 13 core pre-quitting behaviors across a wide range of jobs, industries, and geographies.

In our final study, we investigated how accurately the 13 core pre-quitting behaviors predicted future voluntary turnover. In January and February of 2014, we asked a large sample of managers, all employed with different companies, to use the 13-item survey to describe recent behavioral changes by a randomly selected subordinate. Then, 12 months later we contacted the managers again to see if these employees were still employed or had voluntarily quit. After statistically controlling for various employee attributes that might predict future turnover (age, tenure, education, etc.), as well as managers’ personal expectations of whether or not the employee would quit in the next 12 months, our scale still predicted an employee’s voluntary turnover. The more an employee exhibited the 13 pre-quitting behaviors, the more likely she was to quit.

More specifically, when they rated an employee based on each behavior (1 = strongly disagree; 2 = disagree; 3 = neither agree nor disagree; 4 = agree; 5 = strongly agree), those with an average score of 4.2 or higher had an expected probability of turnover two times the typical employee. Other factors can affect whether someone leaves an organization, of course, but a score this high suggests the risk of turnover is high enough to warrant attention.

The next logical question is what you should do when someone you manage is exhibiting these behaviors—or how you should think about them if you yourself are looking for another job.

For managers, our advice is to focus on retaining star employees in the short-term. Typically, organizations handle a turnover problem with large scale interventions to improve departmental or firm-level commitment, job satisfaction, and job engagement. These strategies may work, but they take time to design and implement. Thinking in terms of the turnover risk of specific employees allows you to invest your time and resources into those employees who create the most value and are actually at risk of leaving.

There are many ways to invest in employees you fear may be looking: pay increases, promotions, special projects, etc.  One technique is to use what are called “stay interviews.”  Instead of conducting only exit interviews to learn what caused good employees to quit, hold regular one-on-one interviews with current high-performing employees to learn what keeps them working in your organization and what could be changed to keep them from straying.

It’s also worth noting that employees in the midst of leaving often take customers or proprietary product information with them. And as most of us know, a quick departure can leave a hole in company operations that creates long term harm. While it’s important to realize that there is no guarantee that employees exhibiting pre-quitting behaviors will definitely leave, those identified as flight risks should be monitored for unsavory behavior. Succession planning for their departure may prevent damages arising from unexpected quits.

And if you’re in the market for a new job? Hiding your own pre-quitting behaviors may prove difficult. Given the negative consequences of turnover, know that your managers and peers are likely watching for obvious and subtle changes in behavior—and that no single action is a dead giveaway. Instead, patterns of behavior over time that may seem subtle to you might tip off your boss. We suggest that you stay engaged with your work, continue to show enthusiasm for the mission of the organization, and project a consistent level of relational energy to the members of your work team.

The basic tenet of managing turnover is that everyone eventually leaves. But the “when” can feel like a mystery. While our research shouldn’t be considered the only way to identify an employee on the verge of quitting, it does point to a set of behaviors that, taken together, can provide a clue—and it discounts behaviors that have mistakenly been seen as tells. So the next time you have an inkling about whether someone is about to leave, know that you may be onto something when you take the right indicators into account.

"A few years back Cuba Gooding Jr. was in his empty house, he looked around and one thought went through his mind: get creative. The Oscar-winning actor had already written three screenplays. But he was juiced about the opportunity to stretch his chops even further. So when he was asked to direct his first film he felt the courage to take that big leap. “I had just gotten separated,” he shares. “And I accepted the job as director because it was all-encompassing.”

Gooding Jr. got busy. He made his directorial debut with the crime thriller Bayou Caviar and also co-wrote the script. The Oscar-winning actor plays a former boxing champ trying to recover his success in this tale of sex, murder and revenge. “It’s a story about good people who get caught up in a bad incident,” explains Gooding Jr. who stars with Richard Dreyfuss, Famke Janssen, Katharine McPhee, Ken Lerner, Gregg Bello, Sam Thakur and Lia Marie Johnson. “Like Crash and Pulp Fiction there are visually upsetting moments in the movie that people will never forget, specifically with alligators. But it is a timely story that people will also enjoy,” he says.

For Gooding Jr. directing was completely intoxicating. It offered control of his creativity he didn’t have when acting. “As an actor you interpret and become a character, but then you surrender your character to the director. You leave, come back a year later and hope the director understood what you were trying to do,” explains Gooding Jr. “But as a director, you influence everyone’s performance and get to make a statement in the editing room.”

This month is a busy one for Gooding Jr. In addition to Bayou Caviar which opens October 5th, he is also performing in his first Broadway musical. (He first appeared on Broadway in 2013 in the play The Trip to Bountiful.) On October 6th, Gooding begins his run as slick lawyer Billy Flynn in the beloved long-running show Chicago. He already played the high-style razzle dazzle criminal defense attorney last spring on London’s West End and is reprising the role at the Ambassador Theatre in New York. “The orchestra is on stage with you, so you hear that music as it blows through your body and informs your performance. It moves your soul,” says Gooding Jr. who spent months and months working with a vocal coach to prepare.

Also, the themes of Chicago's classic John Kander and Fred Ebb songs resonate so deeply with him. “It’s about women’s empowerment and the issues that we deal with today. The musical is still relevant. And it’s cool to be a part of that,” explains Gooding Jr. “My energy has always been borne out of the excitement for these charismatic, boisterous characters like Rod Tidwell in Jerry Maguire. Billy Flynn is another one. He’s got street cred.”

Jeryl Brunner: What is it like for you to sing and dance in a high voltage musical like Chicago?

Cuba Gooding Jr.: I played ice hockey for 25 years. For as many years I have been boxing with professionals in gyms across the country. But nothing is as hard as singing and dancing eight shows a week. I remember when I was doing the show in London. Sunday was my one day off. I once slept 17 hours in one day. I tell people when you're doing an organized sport, you are always taught to breathe. When you are dancing and jumping around on stage, your vocals are taking your breath. So your body isn't getting the oxygen it needs. It's a full body workout, but so rewarding. The excitement of the audience dictates your performance. The more they're into it, the more you're into it. The sweat is just jumping off of me, just from the concentration of doing each number. It’s pretty amazing.

Brunner: What is some of the best advice you received early in your career?

Gooding Jr.: I wish I would have listened to Cameron Crowe. He told me “work with only great directors.” I didn't listen to him. It's advice that I now give. A good director will protect your performance which you surrender over to that person. The director has the big picture. The arrogance of my twenties told me that I could take a great role and turn that into a great movie. But it doesn't matter how good your performance is. If the director is not using the right takes or nuances or they’re not manipulating you in the way that tells a story in service to the picture, you're just spinning your wheels.

I also tell people to write. Writing is the best way to understand a character and the trajectory of that character's journey and story structure. It all informs your performance.

Brunner: You have played so many eclectic roles, is there a part you're aching to play?

Gooding Jr.: I was always a fan of the western. And there are a lot of great stories of African Americans in western history. If I find a story someone has that I can direct and be a part of, I would probably do that. I competed in black rodeo for a while in team penning cutting horse competitions. So I am pretty good on the back of a horse.

Brunner: Do you have any kind of writing rituals?

Gooding Jr.: When I finish a screenplay I leave my hotel and walk through SoHo to the Writers Guild of America. I register the script, walk back and have a coffee. That is my ritual.",None
"The chances of losing an employee within their first year of employment are higher than you would think.

One common strategy to address and mitigate this is a structured and systematic onboarding process. After implementing, you can measure the effectiveness of your program by tracking your new employee's ""time to productivity""--the point at which they're contributing to the organization.

But there's a problem. Depending upon the complexity of the job, establishing ""productivity"" could take anywhere from six months to two years. If employees are turning over as quickly as the stats suggest, then focusing solely on contribution levels doesn't work. Even the best managers and onboarding programs fail at yielding max productivity in this short window.

My theory is that new employees are basing their decision to stay or leave on emotional factors. The organizations that address these four factors are able to beat the odds:

I don't mean physical or financial safety. Let's assume you provide a safe work environment and a competitive offer. I'm talking about emotional security--a concept best understood by putting yourself in the shoes of your new hire.

It's day one of your new job and you're driving to the office. All of a sudden, you're hit with a wave of emotions and doubt.

Questions like, ""Did I make the right choice?"", ""Will people like me?"", and ""Will I like my manager?"" are coursing through your mind. Even though the new job seems better than the last, the truth is, you took a chance and left a stable environment based on hypothetical promises.

These questions make new employees apprehensive. The best thing we can do is to be mindful of these insecurities and reaffirm our new employees of their decision to join the organization.

Be prepared for their arrival, make introductions, schedule regular meetings to discuss their experiences and feedback, and help them establish a professional identity. More than anything else, make sure you deliver on the promises you made during the recruiting phase.

This comes from understanding how things work, which requires transparency and inclusion. According to SDT (Self-determination Theory), autonomy/control is an essential psychological need that results in increased initiative, energy, performance, and persistence.

Allow them to have a voice, be a part of the process, and have a sense of ownership from day one.

We're inherently social creatures--there's a reason solitary confinement is used as a form of punishment. We naturally seek out friendships and connection, just as we do food and water. So it makes sense that our happiness at work would depend on our ability to develop meaningful relationships.

Great relationships are built on trust, respect, open communication, and vulnerability. The most important relationship for our new employees will be with their manager. Managers aren't going to like this, but developing a relationship takes time.

We've all been in conversations where the other person seems distracted, rushed or just plain inconvenienced. It doesn't feel good. It immediately sparks feelings of frustration and inspires insecurity.

Finding your spot in the pecking order is a struggle. Job titles and org charts are supposed to be black and white. But, reality tends to be different when you factor in the acknowledgment of opinions, needs, and feelings. This is where the real sense of status comes into play--people's ability to be relevant and feel helpful.

The sense of status is also why we have to be careful about performance reviews and evaluations. The problem isn't that employees can't handle feedback. It's the natural tendency that we all have to take it personally. It's dealing with the idea that our sense of status and relevance just dropped.",coaching
"I use to be in a cycle where I was always ""on."" It took me a long time to realize that being in this mode was not healthy or productive. I had no balance in my life. I was stressed and unhappy, and ultimately my quality of work suffered.

How did we end up here?

It is quite easy to get into this always-on mode. With the constant grind of projects and client requests, the task list becomes never-ending. Couple this with constant interruptions by phone, email or messaging, and there is always something to distract.

We tell ourselves that in this always-on world, we have more freedom. We might be able to leave work at 4 p.m. with our new ""flex"" schedule, but at the same time, we feel pressure to respond within minutes of receiving an email, whether 4 p.m. or 4 a.m. This always-on grind starts to play with us mentally. We believe everyone is always expecting something from us. If we let one thing drop, the entire house of cards will fall.

I played in this constant grind mode for a long time until one day I decided to call it quits. I didn't quit my role as a CEO, or quit my family, or quit my obligations -- I just quit thinking I had to be always on, all the time.

The stress had become too high, and the burden on my mental and physical health too great. Many times we don't even realize we work in this mode. We consider it normal.

We can stop this grind mentality and still do good work. You might think it isn't possible, but usually, the only thing limiting you is you. Here are some of the first steps I took to take my life back and how you can, too:

Believe it or not, no one really notices if everyone still gets what they need from you. I used to tell myself that if everyone else was responding in minutes, I would be letting people down if I didn’t respond in the same manner. How could I have different expectations than my clients do of me?

Stepping back, though, I realized there are few times that an immediate response is needed. And if the situation calls for it, I can still respond quickly. The key for me was realizing that 99% of what was coming in didn’t need an immediate response; it just needed a timely response.

No email, no work. Friday at 5 p.m. until Monday at 8 a.m. are mine. Life doesn’t stop. There is always something going on around you -- something adding to your task list. You can’t ever finish that list. It isn’t meant to be finished, so working a little extra on the weekend doesn’t “free” you up. It just makes you busier on the weekend. I had to ask myself what I was racing against. The wheel of life is always turning. I just decided not to run on the weekends.

Make sure your vacations are work-free.

Turn your devices off, check out, recharge. There is heavy societal pressure to make you think that in our always-on world, you are not allowed to truly check out. If you don’t live up to those expectations, you may believe that you are failing yourself and everyone around you.

But it's important to realize that you're actually failing yourself when you don't a take vacation for what it is: a vacation. Life is not about working all the time. Don’t steal away those precious vacation days being plugged into work. Just enjoy. The world will keep moving, but you don’t always have to be spinning with it.

Set aside 15-30 minutes a day for yourself.

We all waste at least this much time every day doing something that doesn’t serve us. Be intentional about it. It’s what you do with this time that is most important. I use this for meditation, but any activity works. Intentionally setting aside time for something that brings you joy and happiness relaxes your mental state. Incorporate it into your life and don’t compromise making your well-being a priority.

Everyone needs some mental downtime. Don't feel guilty about it. Own that time for you. Stop making every day heroic. Peace of mind starts with a peaceful mind.",wellness
"The pioneering researchers of the Hawthorne Studies, which started in 1924 and published in 1939, discovered that employee participation improved job satisfaction more than short-term incentives. As organizations began to understand the benefits of employee satisfaction and teamwork, some fields of work began a shift away from the common assembly-line model to organizational structures that took advantage of the highly productive team environment.

In their paper ""A New Vision,"" Professors Michel Anteby and Rakesh Khurana point out that “the Hawthorne researchers came closer to outlining an integrated theory of human behavior than any other perspective before them and to describing a humanistic vision for workers inside an organization at precisely the time when industrial capitalism needed to be reconnected to addressing human concerns.""

Marilyn Sawyer Wesner, author of A Journey of Change: The History of Team Building in Organizations, 1900 to 1989, explains, “The frequency of teambuilding training in organizations rose significantly between the beginning of the 1970s through the end of the 1980s."" “Teamwork” became a buzzword, and team workshops became all the rage. Unfortunately, in many corporations, it was treated by upper management as a fad to be weathered. Once the workshops were over and the teams were invigorated and fired up, upper management often reverted to the comfortable top-down management style, which only served to further disenfranchise the employees and left them to return to business as usual.

Despite these initial setbacks, it has become increasingly apparent that the productive harnessing of the power of a team is here to stay. It’s never been more important than in today’s lightning-fast, idea-oriented organizations to emphasize collaboration rather than control.

Achieving effective teamwork is not much easier today than it was back in the days of monolithic, slow-moving corporations. Although one might argue that working in teams is the natural and instinctive state of humanity, our life experiences in this fast-paced, competitive life tend to produce individuals who can be more interested in self-promotion, self-protection and working independently off-site. We become overly concerned with protecting our territory and devolve into self-interest. Our level of success and level of authority become measuring sticks.

In reality, it has been proven that in the long term, teamwork is much more productive than having a few high-level managers dictating direction without any input from the people who actually perform the work.

With all the management advice available today, it can be confusing to decide on a path to follow. The advice of one expert may contradict the advice of another. However, there isn’t anything especially perplexing about successful teamwork. There are a few effective steps to keep in mind when shaping a powerful team.

Teamwork and trust go hand in hand. It’s very difficult to have one without the other. Open communication is consistently pointed to as the main facilitator in building effective teams. Relationships are built on conversations. Individuals telling personal stories weave a connection of empathy among the participants. Discussing both private values and company values is an important way team members can bond.

It is essential that colleagues feel safe and comfortable sharing honest opinions about problems or issues with others, including both team members and management. It is equally important for people to actively listen to others and involve them in team actions and team decisions. If a team feels unthreatened by resolving conflict, they are more likely to confront challenges within the project or the team itself.

The power of a team is exponentially increased by their openness and diversity. When multiple members of an organization come from varying backgrounds, whether the differences are in culture, age, sex, skill sets, talents, education or even their roles in the company, these numerous perspectives allow them to leverage their experiences to solve even the most challenging work issues.

Another key component in a successful team is the ability of the individuals to carry their own weight in a workgroup. If even one member is inconsistent in following through on commitments and promises, there will be problems with the entire group. Trustworthiness is important in the team being able to follow through and coordinate their efforts more efficiently.

One way to encourage individual follow-through is to be clear when setting expectations. What needs to be done by specific individuals, and what are the time frames for completion? Which tasks need to be completed collaboratively by the entire group? Assigning specific milestones is essential for making productive and consistent progress in any project.

An agile team requires an adaptable culture, not only in a specific division but from the entire company. Being inflexible in the face of today’s ever-changing business environment is tantamount to actively encouraging failure at multiple levels. When everyone collaborates, from the leaders of the organization to the individual associates, business solutions can be arrived at in a prompt fashion. Successful teams and successful organizations involve everyone in finding actionable answers to overcome obstacles.",coaching
"Flannery is out as GE’s CEO and Culp is in. Certainly the surprisingly poor results hurt. Certainly the misleading numbers at the Power Units hurt. But the reason Flannery didn’t make it past 14 months was his inability to make the board believe he and his team could deliver better results faster.

As I've said throughout this series, executive onboarding is the key to accelerating success and reducing risk in a new job. People generally fail in new executive roles because of poor fit, poor delivery or poor adjustment to a change down the road. They accelerate success by 1) getting a head start, 2) managing the message, 3) setting direction and building the team and 4) sustaining momentum and delivering results.

On CNBC’s Squawk Box this morning, David Faber reported that GE’s board was frustrated with the “pace of change” and Flannery’s “lack of concrete decision-making.” Others chimed in that his ousting was not driven by the turbine issues, which occurred under Immelt’s tenure, but by the board being “unsatisfied with execution.”

GE has to be at a point of inflection. Flannery had to lead that. Accelerating through a strategic point of inflection requires a change in strategy, culture, organization and operation all in sync and all at the same time. No one expected Flannery to turn the company around immediately. But they did expect him to lay the ground work for change.

He failed. He’s out. (December 14, 2018 update: Good, but sad history of GE's ""burn out"" in today's Wall Street Journal.)

Onboarding into a new role at any level, you need two plans. You need a personal onboarding plan and a business plan. And you need to communicate those plans and your progress against those plans to key stakeholders on a regular basis.

Your personal onboarding plan is your 100-day action plan. Not to denigrate Michael Watson’s The First 90 Days in any way. It’s a seminal work laying out an important and generally applicable approach to onboarding. But in some cases it’s not practically action-oriented enough. Your 100-day action plan has to drive better results faster.

Get a head start so you can hit the ground running. Prepare in the weeks or days or hours before you start by putting together your personal plan, by having pre-start conversations to jump-start key relationships in advance, by learning as much as you can, by getting set up.

Manage the message, choosing and guiding what others see and hear, and when they see and hear it, rather than letting happenstance or others make those choices for you.

Set direction. Build the team. Use your first 100-days to put in place the basic building blocks of a cohesive, high-performing team. As a team leader at any level, your own personal success is inextricably linked of the success of the team as a whole.

Sustain momentum. Deliver results. Although the first 100 days are a sprint to jump-start communication, team building, and core practices, it’s all for naught if you then sit back and watch things happen. You must evolve your leadership, practices, and culture to keep fueling the fires you sparked and deliver ongoing results – faster.

Your business plan is what everyone else is going to do to accelerate through a point of inflection. This comes out of the tactical capacity building blocks of a high-performing team:",
"When you hear the term inspirational leader, you may get images of someone who’s achieved considerable success, or is a brilliant strategist able to amass a personal fortune. Or perhaps you consider someone who gives rousing motivational speeches worthy of a TED talk – an iconoclast who changes the national dialogue. While at first blush we may think of inspiring leaders as those that perform grandiose actions, more than five years of research into what really inspires others has led me to believe the opposite.

What truly inspires people is actually in reach of your average manager in any organization: a personal, authentic, one-on-one connection.

A study by Dale Carnegie Training revealed that nearly three-quarters of employees are not fully engaged at work. Of those who are, the number one factor that contributes to employee engagement is their relationship with their immediate supervisor. This mirrors what Gallup research has shown for decades – personal relationships matter the most. (In the Carnegie study, belief in senior management and pride in the company also topped the list, which are driven by similar concepts of connection and communication.)

If you want to be a great manager who inspires others to greatness, you don’t have to don a new outsized personality or break a mold. You simply have to choose to communicate, connect, and bring your full presence to those you lead.

Here are five strategies that continually come up in my research for how to be a leader others want to follow:

Trust is the gatekeeper to connection. A great manager doesn’t sugarcoat bad news, evade the facts, or attempt to spin. She respects her employees enough to give them the truth, even if it’s not the most palatable thing to hear on a Monday morning. Great managers inspire their team by being authentic, direct, and honest.

Not only does being honest foster trust, it also encourages an open culture that’s good for business. According to a 2010 study by the Corporate Executive Board (CEB), “firms whose culture encourages open communication outperform peers by more than 270% in terms of long-term (10 year) total shareholder return.”

A straightforward style also leads to efficiency, as it decreases rumor and misinterpretation which thwart productivity.

When you get to a leadership level, you lose your ability to gripe – especially to those at lower levels. You become a representative of the company. The company’s policies need to be aligned with your own personal values.

You can’t just pay lip service to management decisions but must actually believe the value in what you’re proposing. This means being reflective and aligning yourself behind the corporate direction, and finding a way to credibly and honestly represent it.

The opposite – so often on exhibit in companies – is a cancer. If a manager constantly complains about corporate policies, they lose followership and their employees lose hope.

Put the right people in the right jobs.

Writing about the thesis of his bestselling book, Good to Great, author Jim Collins argues that leaders of successful companies differentiate themselves by starting “not with where but with who. They start by getting the right people on the bus, the wrong people off the bus, and the right people in the right seats.”

Gallup research shows that people are happiest and most engaged when they apply their strengths to their job. Instead of changing people to fit the job, great managers try to put the right people in the jobs in which they can perform well.

Most managers know the importance of scheduling regular one-on-ones with direct reports – some companies even require it. Yet, these are often poorly organized, frequently rescheduled, and largely ineffective.

Great managers prioritize their meetings with directs and honor the importance of that time. As Susan Scott says, “the conversation is the relationship.” Schedule one-to-ones with your direct reports weekly or biweekly and keep to your established schedule. Have a format to optimize each meeting as I discuss here.

If you use these meetings well, the upfront time investment will more than pay off with increased efficiencies.

Successful managers don’t avoid the issues—they face them, head on.

The reality is that sometimes employees don’t work out, projects fail, turf wars launch, and tough decisions have to be made. When you’re able to successfully manage during these trying situations, you serve as a role model for your team, thereby inspiring accountability and decision making in your employees.

If you’re a manager who hates conflict, figure out how to manage it. Conflict is a constant when people are involved, and it’s simply impossible to avoid it without damaging your leadership capability. Employees want a leader who stands up for them, clears a path, and makes it easier to do their jobs. Avoiding conflict is no longer an option.

"Squarespace: How We Went From a Dorm Room to Making $200 Million

"If you want to attract clients and investors by being a thought leader, be bold and provocative like Elon Musk. But unlike Elon Musk, do not make the tragic mistake of going too far.

The Securities and Exchange Commission has settled charges with Musk, alleging he committed securities fraud with false statements about plans to take the company private. He will remain as CEO but pay a stiff fine. This is a cautionary tale for all thought leaders.

As a journalist, let me tell you Musk is a great interview. A few years back he spoke for me at a conference that I organized and I wrote a magazine article on him. (For full disclosure my cousin works for Tesla, but I am avoiding the subject with him.)

In the trade we say he makes great copy. Musk is charismatic. He dreams big about electric cars, space exploration and colonizing Mars. He is quotable. Great lessons for thought leaders.

I was sad to read the AP wire story that the SEC filed a complaint that Musk falsely claimed on Twitter that funding had been secured for Tesla Inc. to go private at $420 per share. That provocative tweet meant it would be a substantial premium over the stock price at the time.

Promotional talk by a bold CEO or stock manipulation fraud? A caution to us all.

If you write or speak about publicly traded stock, you need to know the rules. I once had to fire someone because he wrote a press release with good news for a client and bought stock before the release went out the next day. Later he asked me for a job reference. Unreal. Now that is a cautionary story too.

Storytelling is a passion of mine. In literature a cautionary tale is typically a tale told to warn of a danger. Some say there are three parts to a cautionary tale: a taboo, a dangerous act, and then someone who disregards a warning. Plus, an unhappy ending, of course. Tragedies like Othello, Macbeth and The Godfather are cautionary tales. A more recent reference would be the TV series Breaking Bad.

Bragging about your company is a norm today, but there is a taboo about manipulating stock. Tweeting about the stock is a dangerous act. Musk has a huge celebrity status with more than 22 million Twitter followers. That is a huge bully pulpit and should be treated with respect.

When you write a book, an article, an annual report, heck even a website, you get many eyes on it. Was Musk warned about his tweet? Does he run tweets by anybody?

So there is an unhappy ending here for Musk and Tesla. As part of the settlement, Musk and the company will pay $20 million each, and the billionaire will step down as chairman of the board but will remain as CEO.

Now that is a strong cautionary warning that all thought leaders should not disregard.",None
"Being a CEO for many businesses and working 15–20 hours a day every day for years helped me learn what is truly important: sustaining long-term health and happiness. As a young entrepreneur, it was easy for me to think I could push myself forever. But even if you're strong mentally, your physical body can start to break down, and your mental health can follow eventually. People who keep demanding schedules work hard every day so they will be able to enjoy a comfortable retirement. But this is why you should focus on your health at all times -- so you don't have to spend your retirement focusing on fixing your health.

Here are some basic strategies that will not only help you enjoy your days more but also help you live a long life, which, in the end, is the most important thing. You may only start to think about your health once it's already declining, but you should focus on it at all times to prevent it from declining in the first place. This advice is for everyone, but especially for entrepreneurs who are working themselves to death.

• When you wake up, make sure not to dive into work right away. Take 2–3 hours for yourself to set your mood for the rest of the day. This will not only help you have better interactions with your clients and partners, but you will also feel better.

• Make sure to exercise. The gym isn't for everyone, but you might like to run or play sports. These are great ways to help with stress and also stay healthy. Even just going outside and taking in fresh air helps to relieve stress.

• Make sure you make time to hydrate yourself and eat at least three meals per day. Basically, make sure you're not sacrificing your basic nutrition for more work time. Doing so will not only make you less effective but is also bad for your health.

• Sleep is probably the most important element of your health to stay on top of. Most of us entrepreneurs only sleep a couple of hours per day, and sometimes little more than that in a week. It's taxing on your body: Not only does a lack of sleep cause stress and anxiety, but it is likely to lower your patience and ultimately make you less productive. Everyone is different, and it's perfectly okay to test your limits. Just find what works best for you, and make sure your schedule is not negatively affecting you.

These are some basic tips I've discovered through my own experience and watching other successful CEOs throughout the years. There are more advanced tips, but the main point that applies for everyone is the longer you live, the better your chances of achieving everything you want to. There's no point in working yourself into the ground and losing your quality of life at an early age. If you have a couple more decades, that's more time you can spend enjoying the fruits of your labor. Time is valuable, so maximizing it should be everyone's end goal.",wellness
"Most young people who are completing their educational degree today think they will have learned all they need for their career ahead. Unfortunately, based on my own extensive experience in business, I have to tell them in my talks that most of what they know now will be obsolete in a few years.

The rules of business and technology are changing rapidly, and the pace of change is only accelerating. The facts, as well as what motivates your peers, customers, and business leaders are changing daily.

Only those of us who learn to practice continuous learning will survive and flourish as we move forward into an unknown business world where more and more intelligent machines and software will do most of the work we know in business today.

The question is how we develop our future role and potential, while satisfying all the business and personal demands on our time today.

I saw some good insights on this challenge in a new book, The Expertise Economy, by Kelly Palmer and David Blake. Their focus is on how the smartest companies today already create and use learning to engage, compete, and succeed.

I believe these insights can and must be extended to you and your career, in line with the following guiding principles:

1. Make your interest in learning your competitive advantage.

Keeping your priority on learning is a mindset that we all need to build. It's obvious to peers and employers when you have it, from your questions, proactive actions, and interests in new challenges.

For example, an aggressive career-minded professional today likely needs to set a goal of advancing to a new role or new job every two years, rather than traditionally staying in the same role for a lifetime.

You need a plan on how to train yourself, or be mentored, for each step along the way.

None of us can keep up on every new thing in this knowledge abundant world. Don't wait for someone else to send you back to class, or push you to change.

Most people learn best from other people, yet we don't always focus on how we can learn from our peers and tap into the knowledge and experience of those who have already mastered a skill we need.

5. Explore new technologies and innovative new approaches.

Technology is making new things possible in learning and skill building. I understand that change can be difficult, because not everything works, but you never get anywhere unless you take a chance.

6. Evaluate your skills regularly and update your inventory.

Keep your skills inventory visible to yourself and everyone around you through modern online profiles, including LinkedIn and Facebook. If you haven't updated your online profiles and resume for a year, you are definitely falling behind your peers and your future career aspirations.

7. Constantly market your skills and expertise to employers.

You also need to change your company mindset, from always looking outside for change, to developing a culture of learning and career development for current employees. It's a win-win situation for success.",None
"If you don't love your job, be happy -- you are not alone. If you want to know the most common reasons why people are unhappy at work and what to do about it, read on.

The survey discovered widespread employee dissatisfaction -- 79 percent of respondents felt that they were not paid what they deserved, 56 percent said that skilled employees were not given recognition; only 36 percent and 34 percent of respondents felt that they could rely on supervisor and colleague support, respectively.

The hard part is that if you are silently stewing in a job you don't love, it's up to you to initiate change. The solution could be finding a new position in your current firm or more radical options -- like finding a new employer or starting your own.

Here are the three most notable reasons people are unhappy at work and what you should do about each one.

1. The company does not reward your strengths

2. Your boss and/or your colleagues are toxic.

In a large company, odds are good that your boss will change many times. I found it a pleasure to work with some of the ones I had and terrifying to work with others.

When my boss thought the way I did and was teaching me things I wanted to know, I felt great. When another boss gave me objectives and let me do them without interference, I felt OK -- but not very stimulated; and when I had a boss who avoided me and seemed to tell others in my group to do the same, my stress levels rose.

If your boss is not toxic, your peers might be. In many organizations, there are many people competing for a small number of slots for promotion. That can mean your peers might be pleasant to your face and saying nasty things about you to your boss when you're not around.

There are a few ways to deal with such workplace stress. You could wait out your current boss and hope for a better one the next time, you could try to transfer to a department known for supportive leadership -- but that might not be possible at your company.

Or you could do what I did -- which was to realize that when you are working for someone else, you are always at risk of being in a toxic environment as the players change over time.

And that could lead you to start your own company -- where you'll call the shots and have the power to choose supportive and productive people. Of course, starting your own company yields different stresses that some are better able to cope with than others.

3. You don't feel engaged with your company's mission.

A third reason you might be unhappy is that you lack engagement -- which is the feeling of being committed and involved in your organization's values and goals.

Many of the most successful startup CEOs I've interviewed work hard to insure that the people they hire are engaged. In those companies, you would not even get a job if you were not engaged.

But many other companies lack clearly defined values and their goals are often hard for employees to help achieve. For example, many large companies tell investors about quarterly growth and earnings targets -- but they don't break those goals down to the actions of individual departments.",coaching
"More than ever, a leader's job is to do more than shout orders from a corner office. Today, leaders must work hands-on with their teams, understand each person's unique strengths, and finally, have an engagement strategy in order to keep everyone motivated.

We asked members of Forbes Coaches Council to weigh in on just how to do this. Here's what they said.

1. Know Your People And Their Talents

Even the best collaborators need the opportunity to showcase what they bring to the table to strengthen the team. Know your people beyond prior work history and current responsibilities. Understand what makes them feel important. Leverage those talents in new ways to keep them inspired, engaged and performing at a higher level. The entire team will benefit and become motivated to do the same. - Jen Kelchner, Broadwell Group Inc.

When is the last time someone asked you how you were doing, looked you in the eye and listened with every fiber of their being? If it wasn't recently, then it probably doesn't happen. Ask questions like, ""What would motivate you to get X project done in X amount of time?"" Listen, acknowledge and treat them with care. Their response may surprise you. - John O'Connor, Career Pro Inc.



3. Take It Outside

There are team-building activities and programs that not only encourage team collaboration but also have a charitable component to them. When teams work together for an outside cause and feel like they've had an impact on others' lives, they are motivated to put in that same effort towards a common work goal. - Michelle Riklan, Riklan Resources LLC

How many times have you heard what you're doing wrong? Probably a million. How about what you're doing right? Probably a fraction of that. It's amazing how far a compliment can go. A simple email (or even better, a card!) stating that your employee is doing a great job can have the most amazing impact. Add to that a Starbucks or Amazon gift card (just because) and your team will want to produce! - Charmaine Pocek, PhDc, MS, CPRW, PRC, MyImprovedResume

Be candid about how your team's efforts contribute to an important business objective, and acknowledge each team member for the value they bring to the team. Let them know what their efforts mean to the long-term health of the team and how their engagement will be rewarded. Share information about account status, new business and blind spots to create accountability for each team member. - Barbara SafaniCareer Solvers

If you are motivated, your actions will reflect that, and your team will pick up on your energy. While pep-talks and team meetings can go a long way for morale, the proof is in the pudding. When your team can see and feel your motivation, they follow suit. Like attracts like. Be the source that starts the ripple effect of motivation through your own energy and actions. - Jenn Lederer, Jenn Lederer, LLC

Instead of thinking of those you employ as a group, think of them as individual people. People want to be valued, appreciated and made to feel important. Listen to them and genuinely value them as people first, and you'll have little problem motivating them to be the best employees they can be. - Pat Rigsby, PatRigsby.com

Each member of your team will be motivated by different things. Entertainer personalities will be motivated by public praise and recognition. Fighters, or drivers, will be motivated by plaques, trophies and awards. Have each of your team members take a personality assessment as soon as they're hired, and keep it as a reference for how to motivate them in a way that resonates with them. - Elyse Archer, Six Figure Sales Coaching

9. Set Them Up For Success

Present assignments in a way that team members will have a greater likelihood of achieving success. Perceived success strengthens feelings of competence, which will improve motivation. Define the task, plan the desired outcome and set up milestones and check-ins. People don't need to be successful every time, but it helps if opportunities are provided in a way that will improve their chances. - Lianne Lyne, PLP Coaching, LLC

It's difficult to lead if those who follow you are not excited by where you're taking them. Do you have a clear, compelling vision that your team is excited about, that they can see themselves working toward, and that leverages their strengths and skills? Do they have a stake in the vision? If not, you run the risk of demotivation, disengagement and alienation . - Lisa Downs, DevelopmentWise Consulting",coaching
"As a manager, you have an important responsibility to maintain the morale of your team. They want to feel seen, heard and appreciated.

But this isn't always possible if you believe that your leadership role exempts you from serving your team — or if you can't even maintain your own morale to begin with.

We wanted to know how a manager could effectively inspire their team, so we asked members of Forbes Coaches Council for ideas.

You can't pour from an empty cup. Be honest with how you feel about the culture and take time to apply your lessons in an action plan. Inspire others with your goals, progress and observations to allow yourself to join you on your journey. Find your preferred communications method: blog, social media or emails to ask your team how you can help them. Don't aim to be inspirational, aim to help! - Meredith Moore Crosby, Leverette Weekes

Ditch the open-door policy and be intentional about reaching out to your team. It's a leader's responsibility to engage their team, not the other way around. Learn about your team member's aspirations through one-on-one meetings and work with them to create a plan to achieve their professional goals. Be engaged in regular team meetings. Be open to new ideas and follow up to gain your team's trust. - Erin Urban, UPPSolutions, LLC

One of the most devasting experiences at work is to feel unseen and underappreciated. Let your employees know you care by getting to know their vision for success. Grab lunch and ask them what they're passionate about. What strengths do they want to leverage? What kind of growth opportunities are they seeking? What challenges are most energizing? What gets in the way of them being their best?  - Stella Grizont, WOOPAAH

Everyone accepts business is increasing in complexity and complicatedness at an alarming rate. Therefore, businesses must adapt quarter to quarter to optimize results. Yet many leaders are using the same leadership style they used over a decade ago. Leadership principles are timeless. Leadership styles have expiration dates. Make sure your leadership style is meaningful, relevant and timely. - Dean Miles, Bridgepoint Coaching & Strategy Group

Too often, managers maintain a hierarchical role in the company, but by stepping into a role where they are leading from the front and modeling servant leadership by putting their employees first, they can build bridges of connection and improve morale in the workplace.  - Billy Williams, Archegos

The leader should reveal what he/she is feeling in a personal way (preferably in live forums). Executives/leaders start their journey with a bias of demagoguery and alienating superiority. Coming before employees while being vulnerable, even asking for advice, turns this problem into a rare and excitingly fruitful opportunity to connect, likely resulting in a better landscape than when the issues began. - Laura Berger, Berdeo Group

The best strategy a manager can implement to foster employee engagement and high morale is to communicate with their employees regularly that they are valued, respected and competent. By creating a culture of gratitude and trust in their ability to perform their duties well, a manager can gain the respect needed to inspire most employees to do great work. - Shelley Hastings, Synergy Empowerment Coaching, LLC

If people don't feel valued, they won't feel engaged. When struggling to connect with employees and maintain morale, it's critical to spend time with staff to help them share your vision, know you care, and realize you want to value their opinion, expertise and insight. Just the simple act of listening can make someone feel that they truly matter. Feeling valued will make someone more productive. - Laura DeCarlo, Career Directors International

Think of interaction as a dance. Emotion is the music of the dance. The fastest way to change the dance is the change the music. You can't teach people to dance the waltz if there is tango music playing. Change the music through emotional connection. Learn the how to tune into other people's emotions, recognize that people want to be connected, and change the music by sharing how much you care. - Lola Gershfeld, PsyD, Level Five Executive, Inc.

One of the best ways to connect with employees is for leaders to be their authentic selves in the workplace. When leaders demonstrate that they are “human”—that they aren’t perfect, that they have a “life” outside of work, that they experience emotion—it makes them more relatable. Such authenticity builds trust and loyalty with team members. - Lisa Barrington, Barrington Coaching

Leaders are valued for their decision-making and problem-solving skills. These are important skills, however, they need to be reinforced and balanced by a deep commitment to listening intently, understanding and empathizing with employees. Be more inspirational by honoring that employees deserve to be accepted and recognized, and demonstrate your commitment to the growth of all in your workplace. - Alexandra Salamis, Integral Leadership Design

Hosting a one-day retreat with a motivational or inspirational team builder can help build the morale of your team. If this is not a strength of the leader, hire a professional to facilitate the day and consider working with a coach to build your personal skill set so that you can maintain the morale. - LaKesha Womack, Womack Consulting Group",coaching
"“Mindfulness” has entered our lexicon in the past decade as an effective solution to stress and expectations of round-the-clock work availability, as well as the constant distractions of modern life, including social media, texting, and a relentless news cycle. Studies suggest that practicing meditation, breathing, or simple awareness of the present moment while on the job can not only help us feel more relaxed, but also increase focus and attention span, expand working memory, and enhance our connection to others.

As the founder and CEO of Simple Habit, a platform dedicated to mental wellness, Yunha Kim is on a mission to help bring mindfulness into people’s everyday working lives. Simple Habit gathers the world’s leading professionals in meditation, therapy, and coaching into one place in order to provide bitesize audio content to help individuals cope with work stress and the rest of life’s challenges.

Her dream to build Simple Habit was born from her personal struggles with work stress, says Kim. While creating her first startup, Locket, she found herself working long hours, which led to problems focusing and sleeping. She decided to try meditation, and it changed her life. She was better able to focus at work and sleep at night. Generally, she felt more present and happier.

However, Kim noticed there was no existing platform where she could get mindfulness and wellness content from a variety of world-class experts. “I set out to create the Spotify for meditation, focusing on five-minute meditations that busy people can use for any situation or mood,” she explains. “As we’ve learned more about our users, our vision at Simple Habit has evolved to be even bigger. We’ve learned that beneath the desire to meditate is an even greater human desire to manage stress, improve well-being, and feel happier.”

Kim can find it challenging to stay grounded and balanced while running a startup. Due to limited time and financial resources, and the incredibly fast pace of the modern business environment, she says work can feel like a roller coaster. For Kim, resilience is key. She builds that resilience through engaging in the very mindfulness practices her platform promotes.

Kim offers these seven tips for building a mindfulness and meditation practice at work:

It’s a common misconception that to meditate, you need to sit for long periods of time. That’s not true. You can meditate anytime and anywhere, even while commuting, during your lunch break or before giving a presentation.

Whenever you are faced with a challenging task ahead, such as talking to a difficult boss or employee, take a moment to pause, breathe and clear your mind first. Don’t just jump into it.

Even as little as one week of brief, five-minute meditations each day can bring about improvements in your attention and energy, and can also lower your stress. Giving yourself this time will help prevent major burnout. As you build a meditation habit, you will start to become more aware of when stress is bubbling up and what you can do with your mind, body and breath to manage it in the moment.

Like any great habit, consistency is key. Put five minutes of mindfulness into your calendar every day and set a reminder! This is especially helpful when you’re stuck in auto-go mode or when your schedule becomes overwhelmed with a million meetings and to-dos.

I used to use our office couch to meditate and encouraged our team members to do the same. But some of our employees prefer to use one of our conference rooms to have more privacy and stillness. Find the space that feels comfortable for you. This could be at your desk, in a meeting room, or even at a nearby park. Ask your office manager to help you find a set space for your new daily habit.

Meditation is proven to help reduce stress, sharpen focus, and improve productivity. Set up a daily time and invite your team to join you in group meditations. You can also start your weekly team meetings with a one-minute meditation. By incorporating meditation into your team’s schedule, you can help foster a happier, healthier, and more productive environment for the whole office.

Leaders have an opportunity to make workplace meditation more commonplace simply by opening up about their own practice. Take time to meditate at work and share about your experience. This will help some of your employees to feel more comfortable (even inspired) to do the same.

Kim feels that with Simple Habit, she has tapped into her life purpose. “I love that our company is on a mission to help everyone live better, every day,” she says. “I believe everyone deserves access to experts that offer advice and techniques to improve daily well-being. My career is solving the very problem I had in my own life. The greatest reward has been impacting human lives in a positive way.”

To other people looking to align their career with their life purpose, Kim offers this advice. “Mission is very important. If you’re looking at a new company, ask yourself if you’re passionate about the company’s mission. Hard days are inevitable, but believing in your work makes them worth it.”",None
"As humans we want to feel motivated and to find meaning in the things that we do. It’s a part of our biology. In fact, there’s a part of our brains called the seeking system that creates the natural impulses to learn new skills and take on challenging but meaningful tasks. When we follow these urges, we receive a jolt of dopamine, a neurotransmitter linked to motivation and pleasure, which make us want to engage in these activities even more. And, when our seeking systems are activated, we feel more motivated, purposeful, and zestful. We feel more alive. Exploring, experimenting, learning: this is the way we’re supposed to live and work. The problem is, too many workers aren’t able to partake in these activities because the way our organizations are run is preventing them from doing so. To help employees become more motivated, leaders need to work on three areas: making employees feel comfortable about expressing themselves, creating an environment in which experimentation is valued, and helping employees feel a sense of purpose.

At some point, every leader has dealt with a person — or, worse, a group of people — who has lost motivation. It’s frustrating, isn’t it? As much as we’ve been there ourselves, sometimes it’s hard to sympathize with others who are disengaged from work and unproductive as a result. Sometimes, we view their unhappiness as a bug in their mental makeup — and, therefore, we think they should be able to suck it up and snap out of it.

Although it’s easy to fall into this mindset as a leader, this type of thinking is counterproductive and it ignores the underlying reasons why people lose their passion for what they do (or never find it to begin with).

In order to get at the crux of the problem, it’s crucial to understand that as humans we want to feel motivated and to find meaning in the things that we do. It’s part of our biology. In fact, there’s a part of our brains called the seeking system that creates the natural impulses to learn new skills and take on challenging but meaningful tasks. When we follow these urges, we receive a jolt of dopamine — a neurotransmitter linked to motivation and pleasure — which make us want to engage in these activities even more. And, when our seeking systems are activated, we feel more motivated, purposeful, and zestful. We feel more alive.

Exploring, experimenting, learning — this is the way we’re supposed to live and work. The problem is, too many workers aren’t able to partake in these activities because the way our organizations are run is preventing them from doing so.

Take Tom, a website developer whom I met on a consulting assignment at an accounting firm. When Tom was hired, fresh out of college, he was excited because he had been told that there were opportunities for learning and growth. But the honeymoon didn’t last long. “I soon found out my supervisor had no time or patience for experimenting,” he told me. “He was more concerned with protocol than personal development. It’s like he’s afraid of me trying new things because it might not go exactly as planned. It doesn’t leave me much room for learning.”

At first, Tom wasn’t deterred. He worked to improve some processes and tried to inject some personality into his work. But since Tom’s boss was under pressure to meet a number of website metrics, she didn’t have the flexibility to implement his ideas. As the weeks turned into months, Tom’s work became routine and boring, and he shut off as a result.

We shouldn’t blame Tom for his reaction — because he reacted the way we’re all designed to react. Shutting down is our body’s way of telling us that we were meant do better things. To keep exploring and learning. This is our biology — it is a part of our adaptive unconscious to know that our human potential is being wasted.

They key for leaders is to find ways to activate employee’s seeking systems. But how do you do it? If you’re like Tom’s boss, there are likely organizational roadblocks in the way — many of which are probably beyond your control. It’s not often possible to ignore performance metrics or overcome policies and bureaucratic red-tape.

Despite these difficulties, it is possible for leaders to activate their employees’ seeking systems without a large overhaul to organization-wide policies and culture. And, in my experience working with leaders across the globe, you can reach business objectives while improving the lives of employees. There are three small but consequential nudges that trigger employees’ seeking systems: encourage them to play to their strengths, creating opportunities to experiment, and helping them personalize the purpose of the work.

Philosophers have been telling us for millennia that people have an innate drive to show others who they really are, yet somehow organizational life often runs afoul of the human desire for self-expression. Even today, when we extol the virtues of creativity and innovation, we still see bureaucratic job titles, inflexible roles, and standardized evaluation systems that generate anxiety instead of excitement and self-expression.

None of us wants to just perform pre-programmed behaviors again and again. We have a deep desire to use our unique skills and perspectives to make our own decisions about how to help our teams succeed. When people are prompted to think about their best traits, their seeking systems are activated. Research shows that when people identify and use their unique strengths, they feel more alive.

Leaders can help employees be their best selves without changing the frames of their jobs. For example, in a study I conducted with colleagues, we found that asking new hires to write down and share stories about times they were at their best made them feel more comfortable about being themselves around co-workers, and that their unique strengths were valued. Results showed that newcomers onboarded this way made customers happier and were much less likely to quit in the future.

Employees want to be valued for the unique skills and perspectives they bring to the table, and the more you can re-enforce this, and remind them of their role in the company at large, the better. And it doesn’t take much. At both Make-A-Wish and Novant Health, for example, leaders encouraged employees to create their own job titles, a move which prompted people to highlight their unique contributions to their teams.

A second way to activate people’s seeking systems is to create an experimental “safe zone” that includes play and supportive social bonding. Play not only stimulates the seeking system, it also pushes anxiety and fear back into its place.

Positive emotions are important in their own right, of course. But it’s not just that play “feels good.” Experimental safe zones create intrinsic motivations, which are much more powerful than extrinsic motivations because they unleash creativity. Firms are more agile when they encourage employees to think up new approaches and try them out, and then get feedback about how the environment responded to their ideas.

The research is clear that framing change and innovation as a chance to experiment and learn is better than framing it as a performance situation, which makes people anxious, risk-averse, and less willing to persist through difficulty. For example, employees in a white-goods manufacturing plant in Italy learned about lean manufacturing by playing with Legos rather than cooktops. They then experimented with transforming their own production line using the new techniques. In two weeks, the production team made lean manufacturing their own, reducing internal defects by 30% and improving productivity by 25%.

The feeling of purpose doesn’t only come from curing diseases and improving the world. The feeling of purpose also ignites when we can see the cause and effect between our inputs and our team’s progress. For example, sense of purpose soars when we can offer insights to our team about the environment and what might work better. Likewise, we feel a sense of purpose when we can experience firsthand how our unique contributions help other people and allow the team to progress.

For example, when leaders brought scholarship students into a call center to thank the fundraisers for the money they raised, the fundraisers became more persistent and made a lot more calls on their shifts. And, because they were more personally connected to the why of their work, each call was substantially more effective — they raised an average of $9,704.58 versus $2,459.44 for fundraisers who did not talk to a scholarship student.

Keep in mind that instilling a sense of purpose doesn’t work when it is a “one-off.” It can’t just be a speech by senior leaders who speak during town hall meetings about why their products help customers. Purpose works best when employees get to interact directly with the people they are affecting with their work. For example, employees at Microsoft are encouraged to spend time out with clients, understanding their problems and issues first hand. One account manager spent a week out on the street with police officers, for example, trying to understand when and where remote data could help them. Another account manager spent two days in a hospital to understand what it would really mean to become paperless.

It doesn’t take much to light up our seeking systems. For leaders, the upshot is the potential is already flowing right under the surface. And it doesn’t take charm, or motivational speeches to tap into that energy — all it takes is a concerted effort to infuse self-expression, experimentation, and personalized purpose into all that we do.",coaching
"You may recall hearing those words from Sheryl Sandberg, who is as famous for leading a charge for career women to “Lean In” as she is advocating for some semblance of sanity in her own life by juggling breast milk pumping during conference calls with a strict policy of leaving the office at 5:30 p.m. to be with her family. At the time, Sandberg confessed that she kept the habit of “leaving early” under wraps and made up for it by letting work bleed into her home life by sending emails late at night and early in the morning. Since Sandberg made this admission over two years ago, formal workplace flexibility programs have sprung up in companies both large and small. Eighty seven percent of human resource leaders say that staff working periodically from home has boosted employee satisfaction so much that nearly 7 out of 10 hiring managers use workplace flexibility programs as a recruiting and retention tool, according to research and HR membership service Workplace Trends and CareerArc, a global recruitment and outplacement firm. Nearly a third (29%) spent over $40,000 implementing a flex-time program last year, and more than half say they’ll invest more in those initiatives this year. Unfortunately, flex time isn’t working as well for employees, according to the 2015 Workplace Flexibility Study, which surveyed 1,087 professionals, both employed and unemployed, in addition to 116 HR professionals, nationwide. If top management regularly logs 60-80 hour workweeks, the expectation is that lower-level employees will do the same. The results showed that while 67% of HR professionals believed their employees have a balanced work-life, almost half (45%) of employees and 35% of job seekers are still wanting more time each week for personal activities. That one in five employees surveyed spent over 20 hours working outside of the office on their personal time per week indicates that some are going well above and beyond the call of duty. Why is there such a disparity? The answer is likely in your hand.

Thanks to the proliferation of smartphones and accessible WiFi, work doesn’t need to be left at the office. The survey found that the majority of workers–65% of employees–say that their manager expects them to be reachable outside of the office. That squares with the 64% of employers who expect staff to be on call when they are officially off the clock. 65% of employees say that their manager expects them to be reachable outside of the office. There are other reasons for these differing expectations. “This is happening because HR, in most situations, isn’t servicing the customer directly like IT, customer service, and sales, so there’s less demand for them to do work around the clock,” posits Dan Schawbel, founder of Workplace Trends, a coauthor of the study. He also notes that informal expectations for employees to be receptive to emails and phone calls outside of the office has further eroded boundaries. “For most organizations, the work of the company takes priority over the life of the individual,” says Cheryl Palmer, the owner of coaching firm Call to Career. “Human resources takes the position that work needs to be done regardless of the impact on the employee’s personal life.” This is at odds with employees who want a distinction between their work lives and their personal lives, she says, and by virtue of leaving the office, leave the cares and commitments behind. This is exacerbated by company cultures that support workaholism, not a balanced life, says Palmer. “If top management regularly logs 60-80 hour workweeks, the expectation is that lower-level employees will do the same.”

Palmer’s theory is supported by the ghost of the economic downturn. Rodd Wagner, employee engagement expert and author of the book, Widgets: The 12 New Rules for Managing Your Employees As If They’re Real People, argues that fear created by the recession and long term unemployment still lingers. “Once it became so simple to have everyone be on call around the clock, they were,” Wagner says, changing expectations changed across the board. “Companies, afraid of losing a deal or dropping the ball for a customer, have passed the pressure on to employees,” he explains. Some place the responsibility squarely on the shoulders of the staffers themselves like Emily Hunter, assistant professor of management in Baylor University’s Hankamer School of Business. She says, “Balance is in the eye of the beholder and it depends on how much importance you place on each domain.” Hunter says whether its a 70/30 work/life split or a 40/60 split it is difficult for employers to apply policies that satisfy everyone, and a reason that many HR family-friendly offerings like on-site childcare and referral programs are often underutilized. “Research suggests that people differ when it comes to their preferences on separating or integrating work and family,” she maintains. Bringing both management and staff to meet in the middle of this issue should just be a matter of talking it out. Robin D. Richards, CEO of CareerArc advises, “There needs to be open and welcome communication between HR and managers, and managers with their employees so that there aren’t any assumptions being made about time being spent working outside of office hours.” If an employee spends more than 20 hours working outside of the office on their personal time, Richards says, “Learn from employees what it is they are working on during those hours, and determine if the company needs to revisit workplace flexibility practices or if managers need to set more clear guidelines for what is expected or not expected from employees.” Over at Hubspot, cofounder and CTO Dharmesh Shah, thinks that the notion of work versus life is misguided, and the company has baked in a three-word policy “use good judgement” designed to give employees autonomy, in hopes that each individual will strike their own personal balance. “We know that people are often working even when they’re not at work,” he tells Fast Company, “So, we accept that reality and offer our employees unlimited vacation, flexible work schedules and other things that reflect that in today’s modern workplace, happy productive employees want work-life harmony.”",wellness

Here’s a confession: For the last week or so I’ve felt a little drained. Low energy, low motivation, a sense that something is a little off. It’s nothing serious, but one of those passing phases we’re all familiar with when things feel overwhelming.

As an old editor of mine used to put it: My mojo is a little off.

There are countless reasons we get in these funks, ranging from tough deadlines and scheduling conflicts to problems with co-workers or new stressors at home. Sometimes there isn’t even a reason and you’re just having one of those weeks. (Read more: How to Recognize Burnout Before You’re Burned Out.)

It’s normal to go through these phases. According to a recent study, one in five highly engaged employees is at risk of burnout. “Quite honestly in America we glorify stress,” one professor told us. “And that’s another thing that leads people to be quiet and shut up about some of the stressors they’re facing because they don’t want to be viewed about not doing their best.”",wellness
"Early this year in the sun-streaked offices of Spring, a handsomely capitalized shopping start-up in Manhattan’s Flatiron district, Octavian Costache, the company’s chief technology officer and one of its founders, claimed a spot near the bright new kitchen to make a speech at a weekly all-hands meeting. For several months, I’d been working as a consultant to the company, and, though this was my last day, it was the first time I’d heard Costache address the team. I was excited. Costache, a 34-year-old Romanian with a dimpled, affable face, previously worked at Google, where he helped build Gmail’s multiple-inbox capability and various features of Google Maps. He commands rapt attention at Spring. But on this morning, Costache didn’t want to talk about software. He wanted to talk about meetings.

Specifically, he wanted to talk about meetings as thieves: of joy, of productivity, of mental freedom. Citing a distinction first made by Paul Graham, the prominent venture capitalist, Costache told the room that some people thrive on meetings. These he called Managers, people who require a weekly calendar splotched to saturation with hourly changes of venue and cohort. But there are Makers, too — poetic souls whose well-being can be shattered by an ill-timed ‘‘sync,’’ ‘‘brand lab’’ or ‘‘share-out’’ in a conference room. Makers can’t live like Managers. They require ‘‘Maker hours’’ — long, unspoiled afternoons to muse, contemplate the verities, build digital things and play stress-relieving games of Carcassonne. They need rich, solitary, germinative time. In Graham’s formula, Makers flourish in four-hour stretches, which absolutely must — on pain of inhibiting a company’s growth — be kept unblemished by meetings.

To illustrate Graham’s idea of ‘‘Manager’s schedule,’’ Costache put a riotously mosaicked Google Calendar week on the monitor. Then, as he described the needs of Makers, he summoned to his screen a stunning new Google Calendar week, awash in puffy clouds of white space. It looked like heaven.

The room was enthusiastic. Maker hours blend childhood summer-day vagueness with a thick coat of artistic entitlement. But by the time the team dispersed, we’d faced facts: We were Managers or Managers’ minions, most of us, ineligible for stretches of solitude, destined for lives of video conferences and call-in codes. And indeed, only the product, design and engineering teams at Spring — today’s nobility — were now slated to enjoy one full day a week of Maker time. The Maker’s schedule was the privilege of the elite builders of code and apps, and the scope of makable things was not going to include casseroles, movies and corn-husk dolls anytime soon. We were to return to days chopped, like hot dogs for toddlers, into meetings.",productivity
"Differentiation and value creation are tenets that should inform more than your business model. If you want to build a team of high performers, these ideals should also be applied to how you identify the champions within your organization. Are you applying forward thinking to how you select KPI's, but still using outdated employee evaluations? Are you measuring performance based on generic goals or metrics that are often irrelevant within a month? Are your innovation goals reflected in your practices?

A ""value first"" ethos can help you create a culture that is inclusive of diverse voices, recognizing the members of your team that offer substantiated ideas and deliver quantifiable results. To meet the demands of a global economy, you need a team made of leaders that easily adapt to change, demonstrate initiative, and work in the spirit of collaboration. When looking for the high achievers in your company, ask yourself these 5 questions:

1. Who champions your mission but challenges your thinking?

For many organizations, your customer base is reflected in your workforce. Why not champion diversity of thought? Be open to the transformative impact of fresh perspectives and unique approaches to driving customer and brand value. Harnessing constructive ideas could be the key to staving off irrelevance or lack of differentiation. Celebrate those associates who constructively challenge business as usual.

Encourage the associates that apply evolutionary thinking to problem solving. A mark of leadership is knowing when to abandon efforts that have a diminishing probability of success and instead adapting your approach to create desired results. Ask yourself, who on your team makes the best use of increasing levels of autonomy? Who is demonstrating skills and capability beyond expectations to get the job done?

2. Who are the early adopters?

Industry disruptors and an ever-changing competitive landscape can directionally impact your business. Your champions should demonstrate that they are malleable and fluid to change. They aren't espoused to the basic requirements of a job description. They rise to the demands of a role. Your champions aren't just the go-to problem solvers, they also encourage their direct reports and their peers to adapt to change. The early adopters that will grow and evolve with your organization are often those seeking to expand their own skills - either through personally sought or company-led training.

3. Who is delivering value?

Working hard is an unequivocal ingredient of success. However, hard work has to result in tangible benefits to achieve and sustain success. While being the first to arrive and the last to leave is an appreciated and commendable effort, creating value supersedes working long hours without quantifiable results. Establish clear metrics of success for each team and team member, and work with them to set realistic goals that align to business requirements. Examine internal processes and standing meetings to ensure they have clearly defined outputs, and are in line with the goals set for each team member. By defining clear objectives - and regularly monitoring progress and providing feedback - you'll not only set your teams up for success, but enable your high performers to understand and demonstrate the value they create for the company at large.

Office politics can be a common hurdle and navigating perceived threats can take a toll on productivity and morale. Take note of your associates that demonstrate professional maturity and only display emotional contributions that add value. If you want to cultivate a thriving workforce, recognize and reward the associates that display a willingness to collaborate towards the success of the organization - not just personal or departmental success. Leadership teams should set the tone for the organization by displaying healthy discourse with an overarching goal of reaching consensus. Leadership's example will permeate your organization.

Healthy competition and accountability can be a fantastic byproduct of encouraging an entrepreneurial spirit among your teams. When seeking status updates, are you taking note of those that can speak to the value produced and not just the effort behind the work they or their teams have completed? Equally important to establishing an ownership mentality is sharing credit where appropriate and congratulating peers when success is achieved. Are you observing who balances sharing praise and taking accountability? Lastly, seeking help may seem counter to taking initiative but it can be a demonstration of wisdom and discretion. Raising your hand after exhausting all other avenues to solve a problem can be a more valuable use of time and resources.

Create the culture you want by objectively identifying and celebrating your top performers and greatest company champions. If you don't see enough of the above attributes being demonstrated across your teams, or your organization requires strict methods of employee evaluation, use these tips as a point of reference for training and promoting the capabilities most useful to your organization. Nurture the leadership qualities of your champions. Even if they aren't leaders in title just yet, they are influencers and will play a pivotal role in sustaining the company culture you're working to cultivate.",coaching
"Forty-four hours of meetings per week. Forty-six average attendees per meeting. Twenty-two hours of e-mail per week.

These numbers are not a dramatization; they are the actual year-long averages for a large technology company’s vice president. And at the managerial level, things don’t look much better: One IT manager, for example, spends 35 hours a week in meetings, sends emails during 85% of those meetings, and interfaces with an average of eight different teams each day.

There are so many initiatives, goals, people, customers, and vendors competing for our time that it’s extraordinarily challenging to just simply focus. While most would agree this overload negatively affects performance, it’s also something that’s notoriously difficult to measure. This is changing, however – just think about how many companies are utilizing sophisticated social intelligence algorithms to create a deeper understanding of their customers’ patterns and behavior. The next step is turning these analytics inward - harnessing the massive amount of e-mail, calendar, and messaging data a company already has - to diagnose surprising inefficiencies that exist at an organizational level.

Equipped with this information, companies can make decisions about how to better allocate what a recent HBR article (using VoloMetrix data) called their “scarcest resource:” time.

People analytics is not one-size-fits-all, as there are about as many ways to apply it as there are types of organizations themselves. But here are a few examples of how it’s helped managers better align their workforce with their business goals:

One fairly easy way to start analyzing your own company’s data is around what we call time fragmentation. This is based on the idea that making any real progress on thoughtful work requires more than a 30-minute increment of time, and that it takes 15 minutes to return to a productive state after an interruption. So when meetings and other workplace realities (such as email, hallway conversations, phone calls, bathroom and coffee breaks, etc.) are taken into account, a two-hour time block realistically equates to one-hour of productive work.

At one large software company, for example, we saw the average manager had only eight of these two-hour blocks of unfragmented time. That’s 16 hours available per week, which equates to about 8 useful hours. These same managers spent an average of 20 hours per week in meetings. After taking this into account, and assuming a 45-hour work week, managers were each left with nine lost hours per week because of fragmentation and too much context switching (45-16-20 = 9). That’s over 450 lost hours per year, per manager.

One solution could be a 20% reduction in meeting load through initiatives aimed at encouraging smaller, shorter and fewer meetings. We’ve found that a change like this can free up even more time for productive, unfragmented work than is saved on paper because people are less frequently interrupted.

While people analytics can be incredibly powerful for revealing patterns, I want to caution that it is not a panacea. In the end, effective management still requires the perspective of an experienced leader to ensure the data is viewed in context, taking into account factors like changing market conditions or the learning curve associated with a new initiative. In addition, companies that use people analytics should factor in a period of adoption, as people determine how they can best use the data and define the value of the analytics for their specific organization.

But by more closely tracking how you and your employees are spending your time, you may find new approaches to time management that go beyond individual attempts to work harder.",productivity
"Even in what many consider volatile economic times, executives around the world are spending prodigiously on marketing their businesses. According to a 2018 CMO survey by Deloitte, Duke University, and the American Marketing Association, marketing budgets are expected to grow in the next year and reliance on marketing analytics is up by 30 percent.

Not every company has consistent revenue though to cover all those marketing costs. Many startups and even medium-sized companies don't have a ton of cash coming in, so they need get creative.

If anyone should ask you what you do, know how to give a condensed 30-second speech about your business. Include who you serve -- and ask what you can personally do for them.

2. Engage with influencers in your niche.

With social media use at an all-time high -- take advantage. Find in your niche and engage with their content. Their followers will come to know you -- through them. It'll help you form relationships with the influencers themselves.

They may remember your engagement -- want to work with you -- and give you a shout-out when you approach them about your business.

According to data from Cisco, about 82 percent of worldwide internet traffic will involve video by 2021. Smartphones easily record videos that you can post on platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter -- for free. To take it a step further, record longer videos for YouTube and place them on your website.

"There's a legend about a Greek hero who defeated a sphinx by producing the answer to a now-famous riddle: What walks on four legs in the morning, two legs in the afternoon, and three legs at night?

Like the hero in the story, entrepreneurs' success often depends on their ability to solve riddles. Where is the funding going to come from? Who is the right hire for this position? How do we solve this impossible problem? Most of all, the question that looms over every startup founder is an existential one--am I doing enough?

Like a human--the answer to the ancient riddle--a business develops in stages. Understanding what stage your organization is in can help provide insight on whether you're taking the right actions for your company at the right time.

Based on my own experiences, and those of countless other entrepreneurs, here are the three basic stages that every startup passes through:

Most companies are born in a surge of energy and enthusiasm. One or more people have identified an internal passion or need in the market and set out to take on the world. The sky is the limit.

For the first time, you feel like a real company. Your title in the ""C-suite"" becomes meaningful. You are building a scalable foundation for future growth--and you actually start doing it! Everything seems to be going well.

The most common cause in my experience has been over-enthusiasm during the honeymoon stage. In the delirious rush of experiencing your first success, it's easy to miss subtle warning signs. Your growth indicators were probably never quite as good as you thought they were.

You have to have uncomfortable conversations with the team. You are constantly trying to keep up energy and momentum in the face of doubt and fear.  You're going to have to start cutting costs. Maybe even personnel.  You lose your best client.

Jason Bliss, co-founder of Healthy Living Network, is a serial entrepreneur and venture capitalist. He's been through the startup cycle enough times to know when one phase is transitioning into another--and the importance of hanging tough during adversity.

""If you don't run into serious problems after a few months of operation, you probably aren't growing fast enough,"" he says. ""Great entrepreneurs are like prizefighters. They learn how to absorb punishment without buckling because the winner is the one who's still standing after all the punches have been thrown.""

The adversity stage either makes companies or breaks them. It either welds the team into a perfect unit or fractures it irreparably. The companies who survive are the ones who are flexible enough--and desperate enough--to adapt and survive at any cost.

The uncomfortable fact about the adversity phase is that it never really stops. There is no calm after the storm. What happens instead is that companies learn how to drive cash flow despite adversity.

You find new customers to replace the old ones. You fill holes in leadership with better talent. The initial adversity becomes part of your identity--your core team stuck together through a bad time and it's something you can all be proud of.

Now that your confidence is anchored in experience, rather than expectation, you're in the growth stage. You deeply understand the business landscape you operate in and your projections are tempered by reality. You're beginning to fill a solid niche in your industry, expanding slowly and steadily.",None
"Which group would you rather join?

In 2008, a group of psychologists from Carnegie Mellon, M.I.T. and Union College began to try to answer a question very much like this one. ‘‘Over the past century, psychologists made considerable progress in defining and systematically measuring intelligence in individuals,’’ the researchers wrote in the journal Science in 2010. ‘‘We have used the statistical approach they developed for individual intelligence to systematically measure the intelligence of groups.’’ Put differently, the researchers wanted to know if there is a collective I. Q. that emerges within a team that is distinct from the smarts of any single member.

To accomplish this, the researchers recruited 699 people, divided them into small groups and gave each a series of assignments that required different kinds of cooperation. One assignment, for instance, asked participants to brainstorm possible uses for a brick. Some teams came up with dozens of clever uses; others kept describing the same ideas in different words. Another had the groups plan a shopping trip and gave each teammate a different list of groceries. The only way to maximize the group’s score was for each person to sacrifice an item they really wanted for something the team needed. Some groups easily divvied up the buying; others couldn’t fill their shopping carts because no one was willing to compromise.

What interested the researchers most, however, was that teams that did well on one assignment usually did well on all the others. Conversely, teams that failed at one thing seemed to fail at everything. The researchers eventually concluded that what distinguished the ‘‘good’’ teams from the dysfunctional groups was how teammates treated one another. The right norms, in other words, could raise a group’s collective intelligence, whereas the wrong norms could hobble a team, even if, individually, all the members were exceptionally bright.

But what was confusing was that not all the good teams appeared to behave in the same ways. ‘‘Some teams had a bunch of smart people who figured out how to break up work evenly,’’ said Anita Woolley, the study’s lead author. ‘‘Other groups had pretty average members, but they came up with ways to take advantage of everyone’s relative strengths. Some groups had one strong leader. Others were more fluid, and everyone took a leadership role.’’

As the researchers studied the groups, however, they noticed two behaviors that all the good teams generally shared. First, on the good teams, members spoke in roughly the same proportion, a phenomenon the researchers referred to as ‘‘equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking.’’ On some teams, everyone spoke during each task; on others, leadership shifted among teammates from assignment to assignment. But in each case, by the end of the day, everyone had spoken roughly the same amount. ‘‘As long as everyone got a chance to talk, the team did well,’’ Woolley said. ‘‘But if only one person or a small group spoke all the time, the collective intelligence declined.’’

Second, the good teams all had high ‘‘average social sensitivity’’ — a fancy way of saying they were skilled at intuiting how others felt based on their tone of voice, their expressions and other nonverbal cues. One of the easiest ways to gauge social sensitivity is to show someone photos of people’s eyes and ask him or her to describe what the people are thinking or feeling — an exam known as the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test. People on the more successful teams in Woolley’s experiment scored above average on the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test. They seemed to know when someone was feeling upset or left out. People on the ineffective teams, in contrast, scored below average. They seemed, as a group, to have less sensitivity toward their colleagues.",coaching
"Using artificial intelligence to streamline the hiring process is a wonderfully smart move for business leaders. But what's the use of paring down candidates only to find that the candidates the A.I. picked still don't have the skills you're after?

Enter Vervoe. Unlike other A.I.-based hiring systems, Vervoe focuses on using A.I. to automate the grading of skills-based assessments. Candidates get a chance to show off their talents and knowledge through real-time tests that mimic what they'd really be doing for you. The system helps you evaluate their performance and predict how well that result would translate to the candidate's ability to meet your needs.

""The challenge [...] is that this looks at hiring as a pure volume problem. Vervoe takes a different approach, focusing on the actual screening and decision-making process that is inherently flawed by human bias and making it more insightful.""

Eubanks says that, in a 2017 study, his firm found that both candidates and employers agree that work simulations and skills tests--the heart of Vervoe's system--are the best predictor of how somebody actually will do on the job. And he says that, while candidates despise tests that seem disconnected from the tasks they'll really have to handle, they actually want to participate in skills assessments to display what they're capable of.

Accessible to everybody, ideal for SMBs

Vervoe's CEO and Co-Founder, Omer Molad, says that employers can test candidates for any skill, and that the A.I. can analyze any test. That makes the system relevant for virtually any company. But employers who are still growing might find Vervoe especially helpful.

""Hiring managers in smaller companies are often faced with the task of filling roles they are not necessarily experts in,"" he explains. ""High-quality hiring technology may also be out of reach for SMBs. We're changing that by democratizing candidate evaluation and making A.I.-powered skill testing with expert content available to small and growing businesses.""

And the testing process is fast. Molad says most customers start hiring immediately and have candidates who have completed skills tests (Talent Trials) the same day or within 24 hours. The tests typically don't take candidates more than 20-40 minutes at the first stage, although more advanced testing later on in the hiring process can take longer.

Molad's team claims an accuracy rate of 83 percent (this can get better every time you manually grade an assessment to teach the A.I.), and every candidate gets a chance to interview. And so far, 4,000 companies--including global brands like Allegis, Naspers and AKQA--in over 70 countries have put Vervoe to use. The system has earned $4.5 million from job platform SEEK and prominent angel investors.

""The accuracy level [of Vervoe] depends on the quality of the data,"" cautions Molad, ""so it's still important to ask candidates the right questions. There is a risk that, if employers create their own evaluation content, the candidates might be asked to perform the wrong tasks or answer the wrong questions. This can happen if companies try to replicate their old 'interviewing style' process on Vervoe rather than putting candidates through real-world scenarios.""

""One of the prerequisites for having a successful A.I. implementation is data--without significant data on hand, businesses simply can't leverage what A.I. has to offer. [...] With the right approach, the insights around skills can help power smarter, A.I.-enabled practices. A few of the firms I've seen tackle this include Nexus.ai or Catalant.""

""We are currently learning which questions and tasks predict performance most accurately. We will use those learnings to feed an A.I.-powered Talent Trial creator that automatically creates evaluation content. This will give employers even more confidence in their hiring decisions because their evaluation will be based on best practice and supported by science.""

Vervoe still leans on looking at every single candidate, allowing everyone to interview. This promotes a fair process. But even though tests don't take that long, if you've got tons of prospective hires, you'll need time to make the system work. If experts can find a way to create A.I. systems that can focus on quantity while successfully addressing common bias problems, Vervoe could pair with those options as a more end-stage tool to provide both efficiency and quality. If you're just getting your company off the ground or starting to scale and have fewer candidates, Vervoe might be just fine as a standalone option.",None
"Company culture is the engine that drives a business — and accelerating growth requires regular maintenance. Ensure your company’s longevity by transforming culture into continuity with these tips:

Early-career entrepreneurs are focused on one goal: growth. Bigger is always better, right? In reality, rapid-growth can’t — and shouldn’t — be the long-term goal. Don’t get me wrong, growth is vital, but there is a learning curve. As founder of an Inc. 500 company, I’ve navigated the challenges that come with scaling a new business during rapid growth. At some point, entrepreneurs must redirect their resources to sustaining a steady, predictable level of growth and retention. Rapid-growth demands a lot of an entrepreneur. It also helps prepare us for the next step.

Consider your breakeven point as the foundation. Achieving sustainability means you can redirect your attention from that foundation and build upward, making room not only for economic stability but also the day-to-day focus. Once you’ve achieved this stability, you can start planning for steady, long-term growth. As an entrepreneur, it’s worth the extra effort to prevent burnout — and an often overlooked starting point is right in front of you. The key to a healthy, sustainable business model lies in an ethos of employee engagement.

Maintaining your business is easier said than done, but the first step is communication. Want to know what will keep your employees motivated? Just ask. Listening to team feedback and addressing employee needs takes effort but can boost retention of your top talent.

Developing a foundation of trust belongs at the top of your to-do list. This starts with showing employees that they are safe to voice their needs and that they will be heard. Keep in mind that you can’t please everyone, but you can carefully consider each request. Changes won’t happen overnight, so consider this an ongoing project. Keep in mind that your employees’ needs will evolve as your company grows and changes.

Telling employees you have an open-door policy isn’t always enough; sometimes, they need to know you really mean it. One way I’ve created an environment that encourages shy employees is by establishing biweekly company-wide meetings. I invite all staff members — from interns to senior leadership — to share company news over coffee and donuts. What started as a brief check-in grew to an empowering opportunity for employees to demonstrate professional development and share in a sense of community. It also brings different departments together to connect over recent successes, prepare for any upcoming changes and learn about company news firsthand.

While an entrepreneur’s schedule is often tight, that only emphasizes your commitment to your employees. It also helps them contextualize their role in your vision for the company. This big-picture context can motivate employees. By making an effort to be transparent and accessible, you are setting expectations for the company. These expectations are always in flux and the best strategy is to invite conversation. Practicing an open-door policy lets your team bring you their concerns while you determine which pivots take priority. Then, you can restructure current company culture to best accommodate your team and support the continued growth of your business.

Entrepreneurs are passionate about their business ventures. It’s kind of our thing. While our teams may not match our level of passion, they can — and should — still be invested in the company. Show them you’re invested in their personal and professional well-being by scaling your benefits and perks with your growing company.

Developing genuine engagement is an ongoing goal and, in this case, the work pays off. According to , keeping your top talent happy in their roles can lead to up to 27% higher revenue for managing positions. For business leaders, investing in employee satisfaction doesn’t just make the workday more bearable — it creates tangible effects on return on investment, too. The numbers in may be bleak, but this room for improvement means companies with an engaged staff are even more attractive to potential talent.

As your company grows, talent acquisition and engagement take on a larger role. I recommend supplementing your human resources department with best practices that focus on talent and culture. Hiring a pro to go above and beyond will exceed employee expectations and keep them connected. My agency’s in-house manager of talent and culture ensures clear, effective communication that works to find flexible solutions and accountability across all levels. She facilitates connections between employees and the company, from recruitment to retention.

When choosing to expand your benefits, don’t just think of new and interesting perks. Look to the long-term for benefits that will provide your employees with the purpose, motivation and accountability it takes to stay dedicated to the continued success of your business. As growth triggers change in your business, you’ll need to keep company culture flexible. By letting employees lead necessary shifts, time at work becomes more enjoyable, returns continue to increase and your company can establish longevity.

Recognize that the needs of your team are constantly evolving and dynamic, just like your business. While sustainability starts with revenue and profitability, we as entrepreneurs must step back and remind ourselves that these benchmarks only happen when our teams are working efficiently.",communication
"Visionary insights are timeless, but when they’re more than a hundred years old, it can be easy to dismiss them as outdated. As denizens of a digital world armed with advanced marketing strategies, we can mistakenly think of the century-old AIDA model as a quaint artifact of an age that bears no relevance to our own.

First articulated in 1898 by the advertising pioneer E. St. Elmo Lewis, AIDA is an acronym for the dynamics that drive all human pursuits and life processes, as well as a simplified road map of points along a purchase journey, or phases of what can also be thought of as a brand-consumer “courtship”:

The genius of the AIDA model is that it is broad enough to illuminate almost any subject of human inquiry, and for marketing purposes, it offers a framework for understanding, coordinating, and capitalizing on different phases of a purchase journey or brand-consumer courtship. By being attuned to these different phases, marketers can adjust their strategies to maximize and seize the opportunities inherent to each. In this way, marketers fulfill the role of trusted guides and match-makers, facilitating mutually beneficial relationships between consumers and brands.

But because the AIDA model is as much a meta-view of human nature as it is a point of reference for understanding consumer behavior, it continues to hold value for the digital age. When reconceived for today’s connected consumers, the visionary insights of the AIDA model not only stand the test of time but help us clarify and refine our role as marketers in the brand-consumer relationship.

Though the principles of AIDA are timeless, they were first conceived in a simpler setting when consumer behavior was more predictably linear. If nothing else, the digital age is characterized by non-linearity, and to leverage the visionary insights of the AIDA model, it must be reconceived in terms of a complex-systems perspective. What this means in practice is that we need to look at the phases and places articulated by the AIDA model as:

For example, a connected consumer might find themselves tagged in a social media post linked to a brand that a friend has liked and simultaneously find their attention recruited and their interest captured. Likewise, a connected consumer might land on a website that is so personally compelling to them that the distance between the courting of their desire and the commitment of their purchase action may be mere seconds.

In good postmodern fashion, today’s connected consumer might even bypass significant portions of the desire/courtship phase of the purchase journey and go straight to the action/commitment phase. In fact, this is the paradox that titans like Amazon are banking on with offerings like Prime Wardrobe that further turn the linear purchase cycle on its head.

Marketers with the creativity and sophistication to reconceive AIDA in non-linear terms (as Amazon has done) stand to innovate the brand-consumer relationship and deploy strategies that not only leverage existing markets but actually create new ones.

Putting AIDA to work for the connected consumer

How would AIDA look on the ground? Here are some touchpoints for reconceiving AIDA for the connected consumer:

Attention can be recruited through any channel, digital or otherwise, and it’s not necessarily a good thing if you’re reaching the wrong people or dealing with the viral effects of a brand mea culpa. Optimize your audience by tracking reach and engagement and continually calibrate content for maximum attentional recruitment.

Connected consumers’ interest rests increasingly on the perception of brand authenticity, which in turn rests on a two-way relationship of trust between the brand and the consumer. Though today’s connected consumers resent being “pitched” and tend to respond by quickly changing channels, their interest is meaningfully captured by compelling stories. Marketers who capture interest through authentically told stories rather than through sales pitches will earn the trust that is perhaps the most valuable currency of the digital age.

Brands sell experiences, not products or services. However, the desire for particular experiences is intimately tied to personal values and the promise of their fulfillment. Critically, value in the digital age can no longer be adequately understood in the narrow and reductive terms of ROI. Marketers must adopt more complex, nuanced metrics for measuring value as well as new mindsets capable of redefining value altogether and courting the consumer accordingly.

The digital landscape in which connected consumers find themselves is one of dizzying choice and intrinsic uncertainty. This has introduced levels of commitment anxiety into the purchase journey that were unknown even a decade ago. Marketers who can recognize and respond to opportunities for mitigating or eliminating this anxiety will inspire an enduring commitment to the brands that restore the connected consumer’s confidence in the purchase journey and brand-consumer relationship.

To dismiss the AIDA model as inherently outdated is a sign that one’s mindset can stand to be updated. Far from being a quaint artifact of a bygone era, AIDA holds visionary insight for those with the creativity and sophistication to strategically reconceive it for the age of the connected consumer.",None
"Success rarely happens overnight; significant work, risks, missteps and even rejection lay the foundation for super-stardom. The challenge once hitting it big is often staying true to yourself, remaining authentic, even as your profile secures the spotlight.

Adam Rippon and Esther Povitsky, panelists at the Forbes Under 30 Summit 2018, recently shared their views from the unique vantage point of being superstars in their respective categories—one an Olympic medalist in men’s figure skating and one a star in her own TV show—on how years of quietly toiling on their careers preceded their fame and how they’ve managed to retain authenticity in their personal brands. In “Owning Your Brand: Authenticity And The Fame Game,” they explained that success is fed by failure and that overcoming the fear of embarrassment is table stakes for achievement.

“You hold your rejections almost as if you hold a trophy or a prize,” actress and comedian Povitsky said. If you fail, she said, “you just keep going. My strong suit is handling rejection.”

And fear of embarrassment is a common and expected experience—and one that must be overcome to move on. “I remember being so embarrassed and ashamed of times I came up short,” Rippon said. “Later I owned failure very proudly, because I learned from it,” and decided to never make the same mistakes again, he said.

Setting a clear vision of what you want to accomplish at the outset is critical for personal success and building a personal brand. Not unlike product and service brands, articulating and owning a reason for being is a necessity.

Of course, the goal of being a pioneer, of simply breaking barriers for the sake of breaking barriers, shouldn’t be the primary driver of success.

“Because of people who have come before me—they’ve laid the groundwork. To break barriers you can’t go out there with the only goal to break barriers. You break them by accident,” Rippon, heralded as one of the first openly gay U.S. Winter Olympians, said. “My goal was just to go to the Olympics. I was focused on the right things, which is why I’ve been able to have great opportunities.”

And how can both people and brands have the confidence to be honest, to stay authentic, even as they capture fame?

“When I go on stage, all I have is the ability to talk about myself,” Povitsky said. “When I started standup, people said, ‘you have a voice.’” That’s how she stays authentic—by simply presenting what she knows best--herself.

“The one thing I have tried to do is [this]: Stay connected to the people you’ve known forever who know you very well,” Rippon said.

And in the end, it’s only through true drive and unstoppable desire that success will flow. “If you want it so bad, you will get it,” Povitsky said. “If you really want it, I believe it will happen. Most people are lazy. If you’re not lazy, there’s a good chance that you’ll figure it out,” she said.

And don’t go it alone. “The hardest thing to do sometimes is ask for help,” Rippon said. “It’s hard to say you don’t know the answer. If you don’t know, say, ‘I don’t know.’ If you need help, ask for help. You can’t be afraid to ask for help. In my skating career I didn’t get far until I started asking for help,” he said. “Once you think there’s nothing to lose, that’s when you’re pushed to your greatest potential.”",None
"I invited them to share which side of the spectrum they fell on. Some said making an impact, others said savoring life. But, the vast majority said they fell somewhere in the middle and were struggling to achieve their desired balance between both.

The Struggle Is Real Because You Aren't Clear On What ""Impact"" Means

As a career coach for the last 15 years, I can tell you the internal struggle to find the balance between meaningful work and enjoying your life is incredibly common. After years of research, my team and I have determined the problem lies in the fact most people don't get clear on how they prefer to make an impact. As a result, they can't achieve career satisfaction because they haven't defined what it takes to earn it. Want to be happier both at work and outside of it? Then you need to understand how you like to create value for employers. That way, you can pursue job opportunities that better align with your internal motivation for work.

"In a post earlier this week on incrementalism, I expressed disappointment in thought-leaders that espouse idealistic goals of tackling tough social issues without offering practical solutions to affect change.

So today, I offer an example of one organization that’s changing its very structure in an attempt to unify would-be corporate competitors in creating collaborative, socially-focused campaigns.

The Ad Council, a 75-year-old institution dedicated to changing attitudes and behaviors for the better, announced that going forward it will be convening corporate coalitions to fund and support individual campaigns. The Ad Council has been experimenting with this model since 2015 when it created the Emmy Award-winning Love Has No Labels supported by Bank of America, Budweiser, The Coca-Cola Company, Google, Johnson & Johnson, PepsiCo, P&G, State Farm, Unilever and Wells Fargo.

This new approach will result in more campaigns being funded than the old model which relied entirely on NGOs or federal agencies to provide substantial money for any campaign to be created, explained Lisa Sherman, CEO of The Ad Council.

“Brands are inherently placing a greater emphasis on brand purpose and recognizing their critical role in enacting social change,” Sherman explained. “Brands are now leaning in to social impact and purpose marketing as they never done before.”

Sherman is optimistic that as The Ad Council takes on new issues, an ever larger group of corporate partners working in tandem will see the wisdom of putting aside “market share goals” to work collaboratively ing funding smart, public-facing campaigns tackling important social issues.

There can be subtle, but impactful, benefits for corporate coalition partners built into these efforts such as creative that shows company involvement. For example, the recently-launched She Can STEM initiative, funded by GE, Google, IBM, Microsoft and Verizon, is designed to encourage women towards careers that involve science, technology, engineering and mathematics.   Each company in the coalition has “amazing women,” said Sherman, and each has one of their employees profiled in the effort. That should make it clearer to campaign watchers that the company cares about attracting and supporting women in STEM.

Nearing her fourth year at the helm of The Ad Council, Sherman is no stranger to the debate on the role of business in creating social change. How does she deal with the criticism that business is part of the problem instead of the solution?

“I am an optimist by nature,” she told me. “I fundamentally believe that corporations see a role for themselves to fill a gap that governments and NGOs alone can’t tackle.”

I agree. Our multi-stakeholder system that has representatives of many sectors pitching in to create change is full of good players. It is deeply flawed, to be sure, but working within the system we’ve got in an attempt to tweak it toward better outcomes and organizing and consolidating efforts like The Ad Council is a practical, tangible step toward a brighter and more just society for us all.",None
"As the leader of a boutique business consulting firm, I've been a student of the influencing and persuasion game for a long time. This is mostly because I almost never have any formal power or authority to get people within the companies my business consults with to do what we want or need them to do on the initiatives we are contracted to help them with. We have to do everything through influence and influence alone.

It's a daunting task. The good news is there are a lot of tools out there to help, from scientific research on persuasion by industry leaders, to research on how to use logic and emotion together to make your biggest impact, to strategies and tactics for storytelling and how to understand your audience's needs so you can tailor messaging in a way that resonates and addresses pain points.

In addition to all of those strategies -- which are well documented and which I personally use on an almost daily basis -- there is also some great practical advice I got from a seasoned partner at Deloitte Consulting, where I started my career. Here's what she told me while we were in the middle of a complex and contentious client project:

You may be the expert who did all the work, but the wrong person to lead the influencing charge.

At the time I got this advice, not only did I not fully understand it, but I was just slightly annoyed by it. What exactly did that mean? Does the person who does all of the hard work (in this particular case, that person was me) not get to be the person who presents the case for change? Or have the conversation with whoever it was that we were trying to influence?

At first, I misinterpreted this as a hierarchical power play. I was younger in my career and wanted the limelight to be the presenter or influencer because I thought it was important for my career trajectory. Many of us want this -- even if we might not be the right person for the job at the time.

What I came to learn over time is that what matters most is the success of the influencing effort itself, not the desire to be the one doing the influencing.

It can be a hard pill to swallow. At the time, I didn't have the right relationships and the right skill set to expressively engage the stakeholders we were trying to influence. All too often, though, many of us think about it the following way:

To that end, we've all suffered through death by Power Point, where a potentially very knowledgeable expert bores us to tears by reading 53 slides word for word. Ironically, in many cases, that person who is killing us softly is also the smartest person on the team, the one who really does know everything. But he or she is absolutely the wrong person to be conveying the message.

Sadly, the influencing effort fails, and we all lose. The real strategy around influence is finding the right person to convey the right messages, even if that person isn't you. In my situation, that person wasn't me. Had I tried, we might not have gotten anywhere.

Get the right ""frontman for the band.""

For me, at the time I got this advice years ago, I was also moonlighting as a musician in multiple bands. I thought about one of the bands I played in and wondered what would happen if we had let our bass player become the frontman. Our frontman at that moment-- though a bit egotistical, as many frontmen are -- was very engaging with the audience. Our bass player, on the other hand, had said about three words in the three years we had played together. He was a great bass player, though, and had even written a lot of the songs.",None
"Midsize enterprises don’t often get the individualized attention they deserve from tech vendors. Lumped in with small businesses under the broad category of small and medium enterprises, their unique technology needs are often ignored. As a result, midsize enterprises often settle for solutions that are simply just “good enough.”

Sometimes, that amounts to a cheaper, scaled-down light version of a product that was created with larger enterprises in mind. Other times, it means a limited functionality application that was intended for the more narrow needs of smaller companies. Either way, there has been a gap in the midsize enterprise tech market for far too long.

In reality, midsize enterprises are in a class of their own, with distinct challenges and opportunities. They need tech products that are more robust, but without the price tag of those meant for industry giants. As enterprise tech companies start to recognize this gap — note Slack’s recent acquisition of Missions to facilitate feature customization among non-IT staff — the landscape shows signs of improvement. For tech to empower the midsize enterprises, there are a few generalities that need to be understood about what makes this level of businesses unique:

While it’s true that midsize enterprises don’t have the resources of their behemoth competitors, they also aren’t simply looking for the cheapest solution. Unless they absolutely have to as a last resort, they would rather not settle for a slimmed down version of an expensive product. Instead, they’re looking at which vendors can offer solutions with a clear return on investment.

To win the business of a midsize enterprise, come to them with a clear demonstration of value. How will a particular product solve a specific problem? How much time will it save them? How, specifically, will it cut costs or add to their revenue? These questions, along with meaningful statistics, are the ones that are driving decision-makers at midsize enterprises.

While small businesses’ competitive advantage depends on intensely personal, customized interactions with customers, midsize businesses need the tools to manage customer relationships on a larger scale (full disclosure: I am the CEO of Insightly, the CRM). Without the vast armies of customer representatives that larger companies can mobilize, the best way for midsize companies to compete with their peers on both sides is by utilizing tech shortcuts.

The next generation of customers, according to research by Gartner, is looking for a reciprocal relationship with companies, including regular engagement mirroring a real-world relationship. With the right tools, midsize enterprises are well-positioned to execute relationship management at scale while still staying closer to their customers than large enterprises can. Tech vendors should help them find effective resources to get to this sweet spot.

Midsize enterprises often identify more strongly with their industry affiliation, not their size affiliation. Therefore, a universal solution targeted at all midsize enterprises is unlikely to go over well. Instead, most of these companies are looking for tech solutions that are either aimed at their specific industry or that are highly configurable to adjust to the nuances of their needs.

With that in mind, enterprise tech solutions should both develop and promote their products as they can apply to different business areas. They should also offer the ability to easily create and deploy customized applications from within the product, allowing businesses themselves to tailor the product to their precise needs as they fit into the larger picture. That may make product development more difficult, but if done right it could pay off in winning over new markets.

Since midsize enterprises don’t always have the tech expertise on staff that large enterprises do, it’s incredibly important for new tools to be able to easily integrate with their existing operating systems. This sometimes includes legacy systems as well. After all, midsize enterprises can’t be expected to overhaul their entire tech suite simply to accommodate a new product. Many are unable to make the investment.

Tech vendors should therefore develop their platforms to be compatible with as broad of a  range of business applications as possible, as well as common productivity suites such as Microsoft’s Office 365 and Google’s G-suite. The more compatible a new platform is with a midsize enterprise’s existing technologies, the more likely it is that midsize enterprise will become a loyal customer.

One way that midsize enterprises keep ahead of their smaller, more personalized competitors is by having a formal system in place to capture and analyze customer data. From product use data to customer relationship maps, midsize businesses should be using tech tools to inform their operating practices and make better, fact-based decisions.

There is a clear market opportunity for tech vendors that keep these factors in mind and tailor their products accordingly. Empowered by the right tech tools, midsize enterprises can take advantage of their strengths and develop meaningful customer experiences that drive growth time after time.",None
"Inc.com columnist Alison Green answers questions about workplace and management issues--everything from how to deal with a micromanaging boss to how to talk to someone on your team about body odor.

I have been interviewing for a position that I would consider my dream job. The interview took place over two days and I spent 5-6 hours in total with them, plus time exploring the organization.

Overall, I think I did very well and connected with the employees. However, I definitely flubbed two questions and it leaves me wondering how perfect prospective candidates need to be in order to get the job. If all else went great and there was a feeling of cultural fit, how important is it to answer every question perfectly? What do hiring managers think when the candidate does 90% excellently, but 10% poorly?

It's hugely dependent on what the questions and the answers were. There's no formula here, because it's so context-dependent.

Some questions are probing deeply into the substance of what's needed in the role, and flubbing those would count heavily against you. Some questions don't matter nearly as much or don't have ""right"" answers or might give an interviewer pause without being a deal-breaker. On the other hand, a particularly bad answer to a minor question could trump everything else if it were bad enough.

Keep in mind, too, that there are different definitions of ""flubbing"" an answer, and they all count differently. Using imperfect wording, getting off to a stumbling start, or not organizing your thoughts perfectly are usually less important than an answer where the substance of what you're saying is off-base.

So there's no formula. And even when an objective observer would say you answered all the questions well, you still might not get the job -- because your perfectly good answers might be different than what the hiring manager is looking for, or another candidate is just a better fit. And even when you think you didn't interview well, you can sometimes end up getting an offer -- because your assessment is off or because the hiring manager cares about different things.

It's very hard to predict this stuff, and so in general you should stay away from trying to estimate how an employer thinks you did. The best thing to focus on is what you learned in the interview about the job and the employer: Is it somewhere you want to work? That's the part that you're 100% in charge of assessing, and it's the primary thing you should be mulling. After all, do you think your interviewer is spending a lot of time second-guessing their own performance? Nope. They're focusing on whether you're the right match. And you should be doing the same.",None
"Job burnout is a unique type of stress. It’s a state of exhaustion, either emotional, mental, or physical, coupled with uncertainty about the value and confidence in your work. Two critical components of career burnout are the loss of energy and enthusiasm. Once you've identified what's fueling your feelings of career burnout, you can address the issues. Are you experiencing burnout because of a lack of sleep, negative thinking, stressful relationships, overwhelmed at work or career boredom? A 2013 Harvard Medical School study found that if you’re a senior leader, you have a 4% chance of not feeling burned out. Over the years, I’ve noticed those most at risk of occupational burnout also tend to identify with one or more of these statements:

1. Work and your career are the primary sources of happiness and value in your life.

2. You have a phlegmatic personality type and tend to be a people pleaser.

3. Your job is monotonous or chaotic. Being in a stagnant role can also lead to feelings of boredom.

4. You work in, what career theorist John L. Holland calls, a social profession. Jobs such as doctors, human resource professionals, social workers and social advocates all fall into social professions.

5. You feel you have little or no control over your work.

There are several ways we can address career burnout, but an ancient Japanese concept can help. According to the book, Ikigai: The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life, the term is described as one’s reason for being. The four concepts that intersect and form one’s Ikigai are mission, passion, vocation and giving to others.Let’s take a look at how you can gain clarity in each area and avoid burnout.

Purpose and mission are synonymous. They’re unique ways of defining what you want out of life. If your mission encapsulates the main facets of your life: work, relationships, self and, for some people, spirituality, then you’re less likely to feel the blow if something goes wrong at work or in your career. A mismatch in your and your employer's values can also take an emotional toll and impact your productivity. Questions to figure out your mission:

• What do you value?

• How do you see the world, and how do you see yourself in it?

• What is the meaning and purpose of life?

• What do you want to give to the world?

The “Workview Reflection” section in Designing Your Life: How To Build A Well-Lived And Joyful Life by Bill Burnett and Dave Evans, has some useful questions to help figure out how work fits in with your values. Here are a few of them:

• Some people work to keep their brains and bodies healthy; others work for purpose or lifestyle. Why do you work?

• What does money have to do with work?

•What do experience, growth and fulfillment have to do with work?

You Are Great At It: Passion

I have several passions: early years education, health and wellness, art and design and professional development, but they all lead to my purpose in life, which encompasses my work, relationships and self-care. I fell into the trap of passion when I picked my graduate degree. Later, I realized that passion and work don't necessarily go hand in hand but can complement each other. The intersection of mission and passion is powerful. Deloitte has found that passionate workers “focus on their own learning and achieving more of their potential rather than on preset metrics or external rewards.” Useful questions to ask yourself to figure out your passion:

• What problems would you like to solve if you were given a three-month sabbatical?

• What do your friends say you do well?

• What tasks, conversations and/or actions make you feel most energized?

The World Needs It: Vocation

Let your mission and passion drive you to innovate and improve your industry. Brigette Hyacinth is an example of this. She’s passionate and on a mission to improve the hiring process. It can be hard to think of ways to improve your work if you feel you have no say at work, control or lack energy. Connecting with individuals and following the work of those sharing a positive voice can be an encouragement. Useful questions to ask yourself to figure out what the world needs:

• What skills does the World Economic Forum say will be in demand by 2030?

• What three things give your industry a bad name?

• What are global research firms, like McKinsey, saying about the future of work?

You Get Paid For It: Profession

Tom Rath’s research shows that the odds of being fully engaged in your job increases by more than 250% if you spend time doing meaningful work. Meaningful work makes us feel energetic, and energy is a defense against burnout. Think about the environments and work conditions that affect your productivity and how you like to get engaged at work. Questions to help reflect on your profession:

• What would help you achieve greater work-life harmony?

• Is there anything you can suggest to make your work less monotonous or chaotic?

• Do you need a fresh understanding of the needs of your manager, director or CEO?

Can you see how discovering and developing your Ikigai can be a starting point in helping you beat burnout? I hope so. As the Japanese would say, “sayounara (goodbye).” Until next time.",wellness
"Many CEOs don't know that there is a philosophical battle occurring in the ranks of their company's managers. On one side are the performance-oriented managers who try to help their team perform at high levels by focusing their management activities -- such as conversations and development meetings -- on the team's objectives, goals, and desired outcomes. On the other side are the engagement-focused managers who try to help their team perform at high levels by focusing their management activities on creating an engaging environment that energizes and motivates employees and teams.

So in this philosophical war, which side is right? Should a manager focus on performance or on engagement?

To answer this question, Gallup asked more than 8,000 employees about their relationship with their manager. Can they approach their manager with non-work-related issues, talk to them about anything, and get prompt responses to requests? We also asked them questions about how their manager inspires performance and accountability. Does their manager know what projects or tasks they are working on? Does he or she help set work priorities or set performance goals and hold them accountable to those goals?

What we discovered is that managers don't have to choose between creating strong, positive teams or focusing on high performance and accountability. High-performance managers do both. They are strengths-based, engagement-focused, and performance-oriented. They develop deep interpersonal relationships with their employees and focus on performance. Managers who emphasize one approach while ignoring the other risk alienating their team members, lowering engagement, and damaging performance.

Performance-oriented managers help their employees identify and focus on their most important objectives, goals, and desired outcomes. They wholeheartedly agree with the Walt Disney quote: ""Of all the things I've done, the most vital is coordinating the talents of those who work for us and pointing them toward a certain goal.""

High-performance managers create an engaging work environment that promotes peak performance in three primary ways:

High-performance managers are involved in their employees' work lives. They don't subscribe to a laissez faire approach to management, and they don't ignore their employees. When employees strongly agree that their manager knows what projects or tasks they are working on, they are almost seven times more likely to be engaged than actively disengaged. However, when employees strongly disagree with that statement, indicating they are largely ignored by their bosses, they are 15 times more likely to be actively disengaged than engaged. Ignoring your employees, it seems, is one of the worst things you can do to their engagement.

High-performance managers help employees set goals and prioritize their projects. Employees who work for a manager who helps them set performance goals are 17 times more likely to be engaged than disengaged. In contrast, employees who strongly disagree that their manager helps them set performance goals are almost seven times more likely to be disengaged than engaged.

These data demonstrate an important point that's overlooked too often: Most people want to succeed in their jobs. They want to strive for big goals and accomplish great things. But they need great managers to support and guide them.

One of the main reasons managers keep their distance from their employees is because they fear being intrusive or being a micromanager. But there is a distinct difference between micromanaging and being involved in your employees' work lives. Micromanagers take control of the process and the outcome. Great managers support employees by helping them define the right outcomes, then letting them use their unique talents to choose the process that works best for them.

High-performance managers hold their employees accountable for performance. It is not enough to be involved and provide direction. Great managers also ask their employees to take ownership of their success or failure. High-performance managers don't allow a culture of excuses or poor performance; no one thrives in such a culture. When managers don't hold employees accountable for performance, about seven in 10 employees (69%) are actively disengaged; only 3% are engaged.

One of the easiest ways for managers to start promoting engagement through performance is to establish regular meetings with their employees. On hearing this advice, many managers push back -- and perhaps rightly, because meetings aren't what many companies do best. However, our analysis shows something surprising: Regularly scheduled meetings with a manager are critical to an employee's engagement. On average, only 15% of employees who work for a manager who does not meet with them regularly are engaged; managers who regularly meet with their employees almost tripled that level of engagement.

And regular meetings and involvement pay dividends in performance and engagement. Employees who meet regularly with their manager generate higher performance for their immediate team and company and are more likely to report that they regularly receive recognition and praise, that someone cares about them, and that they know someone cares about their development. So for managers, the first step to creating a culture of performance and engagement is the easiest -- set up a regular meeting with your team members.

Engagement-focused managers increase productivity and success by creating an environment that energizes and motivates employees and teams, helping them reach the highest levels of performance. Workgroups with high levels of employee engagement experience 22% higher profitability and 21% higher productivity compared with workgroups with low levels of engagement. They also experience 65% lower turnover and 10% higher customer ratings than workgroups with low engagement. To achieve world-class levels of engagement, great managers focus on the 12 elements of great managing at both the individual and team levels.

At an individual level, many great managers use the 12 elements as a project checklist. When they give employees an assignment, they ask themselves questions like: Have I clearly laid out the expected deliverables? Have I made sure that there are no barriers or obstacles in his way? Is this a project that uses this person's talents and strengths? Have I told this person what I liked about her past work so she can apply that feedback on this project?

At a team level, great managers meet with their team to discuss their engagement at least once a year and revisit engagement commitments throughout the year. Teams that have taken Gallup's 12-item employee engagement survey, the Q12, can use their results to discuss whether they are experiencing any barriers to their engagement and how to overcome them. They can also discuss how the team can meet its performance outcomes by making sure that each of the 12 elements is addressed. Together, team members can identify activities that they can stop doing, start doing, or continue doing to increase engagement and performance.

The crucial point is that the team must have an open and honest discussion about its engagement. What is standing in the way of the team achieving its goals? Are expectations unclear for the team? Are team members unsure about how their tasks should be prioritized? Does the team need more support from other departments or coworkers? Great managers discuss these and other questions with their team and make a plan to positively influence engagement and performance over the next year.

The key to success: Focus on performance and engagement

In the end, the philosophical battle between performance and engagement is no battle at all. High-performance managers understand that these goals are not mutually exclusive -- they are mutually dependent. A team will never reach its full potential until it has a manager that is both performance-oriented and engagement-focused.

Results are based on a Gallup Panel Web study completed by 8,287 employed national adults, aged 18 and older, conducted September 4 through October 9, 2013. The Gallup Panel is a probability-based longitudinal panel of U.S. adults who are selected using random-digit-dial (RDD) phone interviews that cover landline and cellphones. Address-based sampling methods are also used to recruit panel members. The Gallup Panel is not an opt-in panel, and members are not given incentives for participating. The sample for this study was weighted to be demographically representative of the U.S. adult population using the most recent Current Population Survey figures. For results based on this sample, one can say that the maximum margin of sampling error is +/- 1.4 percentage point, at the 95% confidence level. Margins of error are higher for subsamples. In addition to sampling error, question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error and bias into the findings of public opinion polls.",productivity
"Prior to Generation Z, consumers were limited with the amount of information and research they could do on their own. Much of the consumer research was executed in a physical store where the eager salesperson was ready to ""sell"" the product or service.

Generation Z's buying and decision-making process are different. Generation Z uses search engines and social networks to research, then they allow their personal networks to weigh in on their buying decision via social media.

Similar to a B2B buying process, Generation Z is buying by committee for important decisions or for everyday buying decisions such as clothing or food. They are looking for consensus among their network.

If Generation Z does not purchase directly online, the shopping process is just about complete by the time they arrive at the physical store. Brick and mortar stores were once the purchase point but are now the pick-up point.

Generation Z's buying decision is finally complete upon receiving the intended likes and comments in responses to the unboxing video or unveiling product posted on online.

""Generation Z are all authors in their own way and they are publishing their autobiography every single day. They are adding a chapter...and if you want a placement in that chapter, you can't be just a commercial, you have to be part of the story,"" says Michael Solomon, professor of marketing at Saint Joseph's University Haub School of Business, in my recent interview with him.

Before buying, Generation Z will ask themselves, ""How does [this product or service] actively fit into the narrative of my life?""

""Generation Z are thinking about brands in a different way,"" says Solomon. Generation Z wonder how the brand tells the story of their life.

Solomon urges brands to tell their story authentically and to leverage their heritage. ""If brands have an interesting backstory, tell that story and tell it often,"" says Solomon.",None
"Becoming a micro business owner will often mean learning new skills. Whether you always planned to start your own business or fell into self-employment because of changes in your life, you suddenly find you are managing your own business with all that entails.

In 2011, research from CMI (Chartered Management Institute) identified what they called ‘accidental managers’ people that had no intention of managing a business but had to take on that role with varying degrees of success. The micro business owner can often identify with this as the enterprises they create means they have to step into a management role – something they may have little or no experience of.

Add to this the drive to become entrepreneurs and it’s easy to see how the lacking skills you need could prevent you from running a successful business. Sure, some people seem to have an innate talent for starting and running businesses, but for the rest of use, these skills need to be learnt.

For me, the drive to start your own business includes an acceptance that you will always need to learn new skills. Not a day goes by where I don’t learn something new that I can use across my own micro business. Becoming your own boss develops a mindset where nothing is impossible if you take the time to learn the skills you need.

I wanted to find out whether becoming a micro business owner and striking out on your own is an asset everyone can develop. I also wanted to discover whether there is a clear difference between leading a business and managing it.

“Developing yourself into a leader as a small business owner makes business development and growth a lot easier, as you will attract other leaders to manage the various sections. that will be required when a business flourishes and develops. Having a great leader who engages others to be leaders and who can manage well, will entice a good workforce, which will cut long-term costs of recruitment and training. “The development of the online business boom makes working in small enterprises/businesses more prevalent and no one person has all the acumen, knowledge and expertise to grow a business alone, so outsourcing to many people creates a demand for managers, for short-term or long-term projects. Leaders do emerge with time, but many people in business take the shorter route with managers, but often this can be very costly over the longer term. “Society still puts a lot of pressure on achievement, academically and financially, unfortunately, most people spend more than half their life chasing this, before they realise they are missing out on the importance of the journey, not just the destination. Teaching life balance, tolerance and self-esteem will enhance future workforces, management and leaders.”

“I believe leadership and management are not mutually exclusive. They both are important skills that business owners must have. However, naturally, a business owner will be a better leader or a better manager. Focusing on your biggest strengths does not mean neglecting completely your areas of improvement. “We are living in exciting times where companies are forced to rapidly evolve. Leaders and managers are keys to the success of their organisations as they are the glue that brings everything together. Right now, great leaders and managers must take an active interest in technology, because their role is already affected by it. When leaders and managers will fully embrace and utilise these great tools, alongside human empathy, they will be able to be more effective in their roles and lead the company to greater success while creating a positive environment for people to thrive.”

Chia-Jung Tsay Associate Professor at the UCL School of Management.

“It's an exciting time when more and more people have easier access to the resources to develop leadership and management skills, and when companies are perhaps more open to leveraging unconventional sources of talent. This leads to the possibility of a workforce and a customer base that could be better represented by leaders and managers who are more likely to share their diverse experiences. “Whether a new manager or a seasoned leader, we can always keep practising more deliberation before decisions, more reflection after decisions, and more consideration of others' perspectives to inform ourselves and the information set. It may be helpful to periodically engage with refresher sessions that remind us that moving towards a learning mindset that emphasizes creating value together with others offers not just intangible gains, but also likely greater efficiency and financial gains.”

Gavin Howarth, Managing Director of Howarths that provide HR and employment law support to businesses.

“Leaders can be figureheads, strong motivational characters focused solely on the big picture. Visionary leaders are usually, at least in my experience, the worst sort of managers, as they lack the empathy, people skills and understanding needed to motivate a team. Many great leaders I know would make terrible managers for those reasons, as they expect those under them to blindly follow them.

“However, when it comes to small businesses, often the founders have no choice. They have to juggle many spinning management and leadership plates until they get to a level where they can employ someone. This is where clear distinctions between the roles are crucial. If this isn’t established, it can become a battle to relinquish control. Knowing when to step aside and how to do it is vital to the future success of the business. The flip side is that the founders will have learnt every aspect of the business so are well placed for a handover.”

“I think that in future the successful businesses will be the ones that have clear boundaries between management and leadership. Good staff will always be valued, and they will become a commodity that you ensure you retain and keep long term. When business owners go to sell, the second thing a buyer will look at (after the numbers) is the longevity of the team. Recruitment and HR is time intensive and costly. If you have a strong team where everyone knows their roles, everyone can focus on getting their jobs done. The goalposts will continue to change, and I think we’ll see less of this ‘Big Boss vs little staff’ dynamic and more of a feeling of a unified team, much like a football squad. But leaders have to ensure that staff wellbeing and satisfaction is key, otherwise, just like in football, good players all too often get plucked off to play for a better team.”",None
"The conversation took place years ago, but I still remember it well.

I was a young manager then and felt management was plenty difficult. I was attending an in-house management seminar on ""employee attitudes"" - a precursor to employee engagement.  During a break the HR executive who had organized the seminar and I were talking - she was far more experienced than I, and I was eager to pick her brain about some of the challenges of management.

""Well, you don't have to worry too much,"" she said to me. ""You're a good manager."" Her comment surprised me. At that stage of my career I was still learning to deal more directly with conflict and performance-related issues, and didn't feel at all competent at it.  ""Why do you say that?"" I asked - not fishing for a compliment so much as curious to understand what she considered the elements of good management. To this day, decades later, I still remember her five-word answer.

""You talk to your people,"" she said.

When I asked her what exactly she meant by that, she added: ""I've seen how you relate to them - you communicate with them, you have some idea what's going on with them.""

""You mean a lot of managers don't?"" I asked.

""You'd be surprised,"" she said.

It was only much later that I came to understand her comments more fully.  I realized: Over the years I never met a manager who wasn't a good communicator.  It's a foundational management skill.   But of course, you might say, that's just common sense.  Indeed it is.  But as I often say: When it comes to management, just because something is common sense doesn't mean it's commonly practiced.

Don't just take it from me - there's a nice concise description from an article last year in Harvard Business Review that gets at the core importance of basic nuts-and-bolts everyday communication.  The piece is titled What Great Managers Do To Engage Employees, by James Harter and Amy Adkins.

Extensive Gallup research, they write, finds ""that engagement is highest among employees who have some form (face-to-face, phone, or digital) of daily communication with their managers. Managers who use a combination of face-to-face, phone, and electronic communication are the most successful in engaging employees. And when employees attempt to contact their manager, engaged employees report their manager returns their calls or messages within 24 hours.""

In short, nothing fancy, just reliable normal communication. Be available to talk and provide guidance when needed, and return messages efficiently and respectfully.

In the inherently stressful world of employee-manager relations, small things make a big difference.  Over the years I learned that simple communication one can count on goes a long way to building manager-employee rapport. And rapport builds trust... trust builds engagement... and engagement yields productivity.

If as a manager you really don't like communicating with your people, you're probably in the wrong business.

As that HR executive first opened my eyes to years ago, the best managers - always - communicate.

"Most of the feedback we receive isn’t actually very useful. It’s often filled with platitudes and vague labels like “inspiring,” “great,” or “lacking executive presence.” To help someone grow, try strategic developmental feedback instead. This kind of feedback includes eight components. It is: 1) Big-picture focused, 2) Organizationally aligned, 3) Behavioral and specific, 4) Factual, not interpretive, 5) Both positive and negative, 6) Focused on patterns, 7) Linked to impact, 8) Prioritized.

Over the last decade, I’ve conducted thousands of 360-degree feedback interviews with the colleagues of the leaders I coach. My goal with these sessions is to get a better sense of my clients’ strengths and weaknesses, but more often than not, the feedback isn’t particularly useful.

How do you give feedback that helps someone learn and improve? This strategic developmental feedback requires careful thought and insightful construction. This kind of feedback is:

Big-picture focused. The most useful feedback answers this question: “For this leader to be maximally effective, what should they do more of and less of?” It takes a strategic view of what the leader is doing effectively and less effectively today, and what they might continue or change to achieve the organization’s objectives in the future.

Organizationally aligned. Often, the feedback that people give me is based on the giver’s personal leadership beliefs or preferences, and yet the most useful feedback starts with an understanding of what the organization values. When a feedback giver says “She has a great sense of humor,” what they are usually saying is “Her sense of humor matches mine so I enjoy it. (And who cares if others don’t like sarcasm!)” Strategic developmental feedback is based on the organization’s leadership competency mode, a shared understanding of what effective leadership looks like, or even a comparison of the leader in question with another leader in the organization who is universally thought of as effective.

Behavioral and specific. Vague labels like “inspiring,” “great,” or “lacking executive presence,” are of little use without more clarity. A leader needs to know that what they are doing is creating an impression, which then informs your label. The key word here is doing. Useful feedback should focus on what a leader is actually accomplishing.

Factual, not interpretive. Too often feedback is described with adjectives that interpret the leader’s behavior: She is self-centered. He lacks confidence. Even if you believe a leader’s behavior stems from lack of confidence, that is just your interpretation and may or may not be accurate.

Both positive and negative. For a leader to develop and increase their effectiveness, they need to know what they are doing well so they know to repeat it, and further improve upon it, as well as what they are doing less effectively so they can make adjustments. Despite the fact that many of us struggle to hear it, negative feedback serves as important fuel for other changes that are needed. And recognizing progress on meaningful work — which positive feedback highlights — is one of the best drivers of engagement, motivation, and innovation.

Focused on patterns. Leaders tend to get the most feedback on a specific event — how they communicated in one meeting or responded to one email. What is more helpful is feedback on patterns of behavior that leverage specific events as examples. Looking at patterns helps alleviate recency bias where we tend to recall and over-weight events in our near-term memory.

Linked to impact. If I tell a leader she is a clear and concise communicator, that may feel good and be intellectually interesting but not much else. If I tell her that her clear communication has motivated her colleagues and helped them better understand the company’s strategy and what is needed from them, that will help her prioritize this behavior relative to other behaviors.

Prioritized. Adults can only focus on and work on a few concepts at a time. A VP of HR recently shared a list of 37 development areas the president wanted a senior executive to address. I asked how the president prioritized the list. Her response was “They are all equally important.” That executive is being set up to fail. There is no way he can effectively address 37 requested behavioral changes.

Putting it all together, instead of saying “Juan is afraid of conflict,” strategic developmental feedback would sound like this:

“Juan’s top two strengths, in terms of their impact on the business, are his strategic thinking and his ability to build strong relationships. More on that shortly. The most important gap for Juan to address to get to the next level is how he navigates conflict. Our organization is very direct and values leaders who confront issues head on, without inauthentic positivity. The pattern for Juan is that when he does not agree with a colleague’s position, he remains silent about his opposition. I’m not sure why he does this, but the impact is that I think he is in agreement when he is not. And later, when he shares his opposition with me, it is frustrating to me because we have already put a plan in place based on the belief that he was in agreement. It causes rework and it lowers my trust in him. Let me give you a few examples of when this has happened…”

Creating feedback that is truly useful requires more care and attention than is typically invested. Like any skill — chess, golf, learning Mandarin — offering strategic developmental feedback requires that we pay attention to and do many things effectively and simultaneously. Given the opportunity to help others develop and become more effective, it’s worth the effort.",coaching
"Less than one-third of Americans are engaged in their jobs in any given year. This finding has remained consistent since 2000, when Gallup first began measuring and reporting on U.S. workplace engagement.

Gallup defines engaged employees as those who are involved in and enthusiastic about their work and workplace. But the majority of employees are indifferent, sleepwalking through their workday without regard for their performance or their organization’s performance. As a result, vital economic influencers such as growth and innovation are at risk.

Gallup’s latest report, State of the American Manager, provides an in-depth look at what characterizes great managers and examines the crucial links between talent, engagement, and vital business outcomes such as profitability and productivity. Our research shows that managers account for as much as 70% of variance in employee engagement scores. Given the troubling state of employee engagement in the U.S. today, it makes sense that most managers are not creating environments in which employees feel motivated or even comfortable. A Gallup study of 7,272 U.S. adults revealed that one in two had left their job to get away from their manager to improve their overall life at some point in their career. Having a bad manager is often a one-two punch: Employees feel miserable while at work, and that misery follows them home, compounding their stress and negatively affecting their overall well-being.

But it’s not enough to simply label a manager as “bad” or “good.” Organizations need to understand what managers are doing in the workplace to create or destroy engagement. In another study of 7,712 U.S. adults, Gallup asked respondents to rate their manager on specific behaviors. These behaviors – related to communication, performance management, and individual strengths – strongly link to employee engagement and give organizations better insights into developing their managers and raising the overall level of performance of the business.

Communication is often the basis of any healthy relationship, including the one between an employee and his or her manager. Gallup has found that consistent communication – whether it occurs in person, over the phone, or electronically – is connected to higher engagement. For example, employees whose managers hold regular meetings with them are almost three times as likely to be engaged as employees whose managers do not hold regular meetings with them.

Gallup also finds that engagement is highest among employees who have some form (face-to-face, phone, or digital) of daily communication with their managers. Managers who use a combination of face-to-face, phone, and electronic communication are the most successful in engaging employees. And when employees attempt to contact their manager, engaged employees report their manager returns their calls or messages within 24 hours. These ongoing transactions explain why engaged workers are also more likely to report their manager knows what projects or tasks they are working on.

But mere transactions between managers and employees are not enough to maximize engagement. Employees value communication from their manager not just about their roles and responsibilities but also about what happens in their lives outside of work. The Gallup study reveals that employees who feel as though their manager is invested in them as people are more likely to be engaged.

The best managers make a concerted effort to get to know their employees and help them feel comfortable talking about any subject, whether it is work related or not. A productive workplace is one in which people feel safe – safe enough to experiment, to challenge, to share information, and to support one another. In this type of workplace, team members are prepared to give the manager and their organization the benefit of the doubt. But none of this can happen if employees do not feel cared about.

Great managers have the talent to motivate employees and build genuine relationships with them. Those who are not well-suited for the job will likely be uncomfortable with this “soft” aspect of management. The best managers understand that each person they manage is different. Each person has different successes and challenges both at and away from work. Knowing their employees as people first, these managers accommodate their employees’ uniqueness while managing toward high performance.

Performance management is often a source of great frustration for employees who do not clearly understand their goals or what is expected of them at work. They may feel conflicted about their duties and disconnected from the bigger picture. For these employees, annual reviews and developmental conversations feel forced and superficial, and it is impossible for them to think about next year’s goals when they are not even sure what tomorrow will throw at them.

Yet, when performance management is done well, employees become more productive, profitable, and creative contributors. Gallup finds that employees whose managers excel at performance management activities are more engaged than employees whose managers struggle with these same tasks.

In our Q12 research, Gallup has discovered that clarity of expectations is perhaps the most basic of employee needs and is vital to performance. Helping employees understand their responsibilities may seem like “Management 101” but employees need more than written job descriptions to fully grasp their roles. Great managers don’t just tell employees what’s expected of them and leave it at that; instead, they frequently talk with employees about their responsibilities and progress. They don’t save those critical conversations for once-a-year performance reviews.

Engaged employees are more likely than their colleagues to say their managers help them set work priorities and performance goals. They are also more likely to say their managers hold them accountable for their performance. To these employees, accountability means that all employees are treated fairly or held to the same standards, which allows those with superior performance to shine.

Gallup researchers have studied human behavior and strengths for decades and discovered that building employees’ strengths is a far more effective approach than a fixation on weaknesses. A strengths-based culture is one in which employees learn their roles more quickly, produce more and significantly better work, stay with their company longer, and are more engaged. In the current study, a vast majority (67%) of employees who strongly agree that their manager focuses on their strengths or positive characteristics are engaged, compared with just 31% of the employees who indicate strongly that their manager focuses on their weaknesses.

When managers help employees grow and develop through their strengths, they are more than twice as likely to engage their team members. The most powerful thing a manager can do for employees is to place them in jobs that allow them to use the best of their natural talents, adding skills and knowledge to develop and apply their strengths.",coaching
"In design, nothing happens without trust. Imagining the future is risky and involves multiple leaps of faith. The organization and the team need to trust you as the designer and you need to trust them.

When you were a kid, you played with other children and through this built trust. It is actually not that different in adulthood. Playing together is key to building trust in one another.

My favorite kind of design play is getting out of the office--just like kids who go out to play in the park are getting out of the safety of their home. One great way of doing that is site visits. They take you out of the safety of your office environment and create a mutual learning space for the whole team. Building a prototype together, watching documentaries together, or attending a conference as a team--all opportunities for learning as much as building trust through shared experiences.

There's nothing like a demo to build trust. And the lack of, to fester destructive doubts. I learned this first hand when designing the Resolve Office System and an executive had doubts about whether this new system made up of poles (instead of the traditional panels) would look like a sea of trees. The team could've ignored the question. Instead, we built 120 stations out of PVC pipes and foamcore in a warehouse. Together we saw that the experience felt great in full scale and actually strengthened our conviction that we were on to something important.

Similarly, the design process is structured in phases so that trust is built as the process evolves and as the idea develops. As the team goes from research to ideation, from concept to design, from development to manufacturing, and finally from marketing to market launch, the confidence grows and strengthens. It is easy to fail early and restart the process without losing trust in each other. Inversely, you really need to trust each other by the time you're ready to launch a product, a service, or a company into the world.

Trust is built through success, but even faster through failure or adversity. This year a family crisis brought me closer to my uncle--I asked for his help and the way he was there for me changed our decades-old relationship for the better. Without the adversity of a crisis, we would not have known the friendship and trust we enjoy today.

When you or the team fails, or are faced with a challenge, how everyone responds to failure is a great litmus test for whether you can trust each other or not. WD-40 CEO, Garry Ridge, sees failure as an opportunity to learn.

One of the ways companies build trust with their end users today is by co-designing with them. Co-design creates empathy, an understanding of the feelings of someone else. It also asks for input from users in solving problems, versus assuming how to solve it for them. Both of these contribute to a sense of trust, of being heard and not being taken for granted.

Even companies that co-design with their end users often forget to deploy these tools internally. Putting an organizational problem on the table to solve it together not only builds ownership. It also builds trust.

Last but not least, trust builds over breaking bread together. Europeans do this well--they'll take you to dinner before they do anything and the conversation will be mostly about anything but work. Dinner is a relaxed affair that aims to find out what kind of a person you are outside of work. If we are going to work together, will we also enjoy each other as people?",communication
"Diversity and inclusion is a booming field. I have seen it grow immensely over the last 15 years, from its origin as part of an organization's human resources department to the standalone profession it is today with a deep breadth of study. Corporate America is very invested in diversity and inclusion, but are these time and financial investments really moving the needle?

When I was a new leader, my organization introduced a program to help with its diversity goals. We were moving from affirmative action to tolerance and acceptance. I am a first-generation American citizen born to immigrant parents; blending in or assimilating because we were different was ingrained in me from early childhood. Therefore, at that time, the phrase ""tolerance and acceptance"" did not elicit the visceral reaction it does today. In fact, I counted myself lucky to work for an organization that wanted others to know I was acceptable.

I counted myself lucky to participate in Hispanic and women's networks where I learned how to dress appropriately and how to speak with confidence — but never too much confidence. I was taught how to assimilate into corporate America and blend in. I was grateful for all the resources my organization was pouring into my career development.

One day, I attended a seminar where I was introduced to the book A Peacock in the Land of Penguins by B. J. Gallagher Hateley. In her book, the author describes a corporation staffed exclusively by penguins -- that is, until they hire a peacock. Now, the peacock doesn't look like them, dress like them or speak like them. The penguins, well-intentioned as they are, try to help the peacock assimilate, blend in, get with the program.

It wasn't long before I realized, I was the peacock. Queue the visceral reaction now as I understood that this meant I was not acceptable; something about me had to be tolerated until such time as I became a penguin.

The trouble with turning a peacock into a penguin is you miss out on all the good parts of the peacock. Every story, every experience, every differing point of view gets suppressed so that they can be accepted by the penguins, and organizations are worse off for it. But that was more than 15 years ago. We have made great progress in the diversity space by now. Or have we?

I recently attended the Professionals in Human Resources Association's annual conference, where two messages came through loud and clear: It is all about the people, and diversity and inclusion is a business imperative with a measurable ROI. Diverse candidates have gone from being peacocks who have to be accepted, to measurable ROI. In my book, that is an improvement, albeit a small one in reality because we are still in the business of justifying diversity.

Now, there are some great organizations where inclusion for all is a key strategic imperative, and I was energized by hearing those leaders share what they are doing. They boast high engagement index scores with corresponding retention rates and outperform their competitors. They get it: Inclusion leads to engagement, and engagement is good for the organization. However, if we are still trying to make a business case for diversity in our organizations, then we are getting left behind because these leaders are way ahead of the curve.

We are in one of the tightest labor markets of recent times. Talented individuals have options, and many of those talented individuals are peacocks and every other type of beautiful and exotic bird that flies or stays on land, but they are not all penguins. They are also much smarter, bolder and empowered in the knowledge that they are ROI — and that is a language business understands. Trust me: Your competitors do.",None
"The stakes are high. Worldwide, Gallup found that 87% of employees are disengaged. The same study noted that highly-engaged workforces outperform their peers by 147% in earnings per share. But how do you motivate and reengage your employee? It's a challenge many leaders face on a daily basis. The answer may require you to think outside the box and, believe it or not, actually have fun.

Gamification is a buzzword with a simple meaning: the act of making something more like a game. From the persistent glow of the world’s mobile phones, game consoles and sports channels on TV screens, it’s clear that a love of games unites us across geographic and demographic lines. Games enthrall us, engage us, entertain us and bring us closer together. When we make something more game-like, we make it more engaging, more motivating, and more fun. As a professional who works with gamification every single day, I can say that this is why gamification is so powerful when applied to tasks or jobs, where motivation and engagement are difficult to secure.

Where Gamification Got Its Start

Not surprisingly, technology companies recognized this concept early on. Michael R. Solomon, Ph.D., professor of marketing at Saint Joseph’s University, noted a few years ago that the regional offices of software companies were participating in competitions in order to motivate employees and help them complete repetitive, detail-oriented tasks such as catching errors in lines of code. More recently, companies across various industries have learned that gamification can be a powerful tool to engage employees, according to Dr. Solomon.

How To Implement Gamification In Your Office

You can start implementing gamification techniques with nothing more than a whiteboard or, for a distributed team, an Excel spreadsheet. That’s how I got started with gamification many years ago when I was working on a retail sales team that was struggling to stay motivated. As a last-ditch effort to engage our team, we created a game that assigned points to sales and we tracked this in an Excel spreadsheet. This simple act was the first step to making work fun again. As the team transformed more of our sales goals into games and contests, we steadily improved our performance.

Though barebones at the time, this system worked then and can be effective today in organizations like yours because its game-like elements were tied to meaningful activities. This is the key to doing gamification “right” in the enterprise. You need to gamify what truly matters.

If you are creating your own system for your employees, consider the following elements that I have seen work first-hand as the CEO and founder of a company that specializes in gamification:

• Leaderboards. These shouldn’t just rank employees on their progress towards goals like sales quotas or completed tasks. Instead, effective leaderboards focus on rewarding employees based on how they perform relative to their coworkers that are closest to their position. This means they’re not demotivated by the long climb to the top and focus only on competing with the people that are relatively similar to them in performance.

• Contests. A little competition will incentivize bursts of high performance. One example would be a competition to upsell the most upgrades over a one-week period at a car rental franchise.

• Public recognition. This is always a great reward for work well done. This can be in the form of something such as a “superstar of the week” award, which is given to an employee by a manager. The employee then chooses the winner for next week.

• Tokens or stars. Leaders can distribute these rewards for good work or for meeting goals. Some systems can allow tokens to be traded for something the employee values, like gift cards or flex-time. I have seen this work with something as simple as paper or digital tokens awarded to an employee who comes up with a clever way to merchandise a new product. The employee then redeems these tokens for an early finish to a shift of their choice.

•Titles. This refers to a system where employees who achieve specific goals earn titles that progress towards perks in the office. An example would be awarding a “trailblazer” title to the employee who signs up the first demo for a new product, giving them the perk of leaving 15 minutes earlier etc.

What makes gamification so effective is not the badges, tokens or even the friendly competition but it's the way it taps into our psychological need for implicit rewards.

Implicit rewards are internal: unlike a cash bonus or gold watch, they are valuable mainly because of what they mean to us. Often, they have very little real-world value, but they may be priceless to your employees. If you ever received a gold star as a child by a teacher or parent, you know what the simple joy of an implicit rewards feels like.

Gamification works particularly well for enterprises because implicit rewards are infinitely scalable. Once you figure out a game that works to get salespeople excited about a goal, you can spread it through every level of the organization. Because implicit rewards have only symbolic value, they’re free. You can dramatically scale up your implicit rewards system without scaling its costs.

Gamification can be implemented anywhere from the smallest team to the largest enterprise. To start with, all you need is a spreadsheet and an important goal that can be measured. Your employees’ love of games and the implicit rewards they yield will take care of the rest.",coaching
"We've heard that hope is being able to see the light, despite all of the darkness. We have felt it, in the face of disappointment after disappointment. Above all else, we have learned that even a small glimmer of hope can push us to survive the most trying of times.

Luckily, when it feels like hope is unavailable during the toughest of times, there are actually more than a few things you can do that will have you feeling hopeful sooner rather than later.

Whether you have an hour to kill or a mere 15 minutes, connecting with nature has a great capacity to lift your spirits. For years, psychologists have found that being in nature has been shown to boost well-being and reduce stress. Researchers at Stanford University believe nature reduces rumination, ""a maladaptive pattern of self-referential thought that is associated with heightened risk for depression and other mental illnesses."" In other words, going outside for a short walk will create a diversion from dark thoughts, and can even encourage fascination and a sense of belonging.

Sometimes all it takes is 3-4 minutes of a good tune to make you feel better. Music can motivate your workout, soothe a broken heart, and even give you serious health benefits. Scientists have found that not only can certain kinds of music relieve symptoms of depression, but listening to music can have a healthy effect on blood vessel function making listeners feel happier.

With today's headlines, or with your own obstacles, it may feel impossible to have a positive attitude. But it is possible to gradually train your brain to lean into optimism, something cognitive neuroscientist Tali Sharot says can even change subjective reality. ""The way we expect the world to be changes the way we see it,"" she notes. How we perceive the world ""changes objective reality"" and ""acts as a self-fulfilling prophecy"" -- when you start to notice the simple pleasures around you, you will find more and more things to be grateful for arriving into your life.

As Martin Luther King Jr. once said, ""We must accept finite disappointment, but never lose infinite hope."" If there are days you feel as if hope is no longer in infinite supply, remember: you can always find hope without ever having to wait too long for it.",None
"Thanks to the shambolic state of politics in this country, Americans have had a lot of occasion to think about lying, who lies, and how to spot a liar lately. The issue has been dissected in op-eds, screamed about over dinner tables, and puzzled over by disgusted citizens of every political persuasion.

While there are a few studies that suggest ways to spot individual deception--like impersonal language, excessive negativity, and over complicated word choice--perhaps the most fascinating (and terrifying) truth about dishonesty is just how easily it snowballs.

We think of lying as something we do to others, but in fact lying also does something to us. In short, the more you lie, the easier lying becomes. In a Washington Post article rounding up recent research on lying, reporters William Wan and Sarah Kaplan explain:

In a 2016 study in the journal Nature Neuroscience, [Duke psychologist Dan] Ariely and colleagues showed how dishonesty alters people's brains, making it easier to tell lies in the future. When people uttered a falsehood, the scientists noticed a burst of activity in their amygdala. The amygdala is a crucial part of the brain that produces fear, anxiety, and emotional responses--including that sinking, guilty feeling you get when you lie. But when scientists had their subjects play a game in which they won money by deceiving their partner, they noticed the negative signals from the amygdala began to decrease. Not only that, but when people faced no consequences for dishonesty, their falsehoods tended to get even more sensational.

Lying, in effect, desensitizes your brain to the fear of getting caught or hurting others, making lying for your own benefit down the road much easier.

What sort of brain are you building?

The good news is that this principle--summed up by neuroscientists with the phrase ""neurons that fire together wire together""--isn't just true of dishonesty. These sort of feedbacks loops, in which thinking a thought or performing an action makes thinking or doing something similar in the future easier, exist for positive traits as well as negative ones. Lying getting easier the more you do it, but so does gratitude, for instance.

And there's even more reason to believe that telling the truth will strengthen your honesty muscles. We often fear honesty will be awkward and cause conflict, but a recent study out of the University of Chicago shows the opposite. Researchers asked participants to be more honest for a few days while reflecting on their expectations of the experience and its actual consequences. They discovered honesty is actually way more pleasant than we think it will be.

""People generally assume that others will react negatively towards increased honesty. As a result, people assume that honest conversations will be personally distressing and harm their relationships. In reality, honesty is much more enjoyable and less harmful for relationships than people anticipate,"" said study co-author Emma Levine, summing up the findings for Quartz.

That suggests that while lying gets easier the more you do it. So does honesty, not least because you'll probably see just how positively telling the truth impacts your life.

What's the bottom line here? These findings might help you understand how some of the monsters you see on the evening news got to be so monstrous, but that's admittedly pretty cold comfort. Instead, they're probably more useful as a warning.

If you're tempted by just one or two little falsehoods, beware. Science suggests that even if you don't get caught--especially if you don't get caught--you're doing real damage to your character. On the other hand, find the courage to be honest and you'll probably be rewarded with way more positive reactions than you expect.",None
"I arrived early for lunch with Rob Schenck at the University Club in Washington, D.C.,  and so I sat there for a while in the dining room, eye-to-eye with the portrait of William Howard Taft. The portrait has always seemed absurd to me; he was a minor president and Supreme Court justice. But a lot of things in Washington, D.C. seem absurd, starting with the illusion that politics changes anybody's mind. The real changes happen after you put politics aside.

Schenck was one of the most powerful conservative evangelicals operating in Washington. But he broke publicly with the Evangelical Church Alliance after many high profile evangelical leaders he knew, including some on the Alliance’s own board, signaled their support of Donald Trump for president.  Trump’s behavior appalled him. He also thought it important to put more space between faith and politics. “When faith becomes inextricably linked to a political position we are in danger of losing our souls,” he says.

His decision in the past few years to step away from tribal politics and return to preaching his faith and conscience could portend a movement by evangelicals away from their generational hard-and-fast support of the Republican Party, and perhaps from politics in general. Eighty-one percent of evangelicals voted for Trump, according to Schenck’s book, Costly Grace.

Schenck’s conversion away from right-wing politics began about five years ago, on the issue of gun rights, which he calls “gun doctrine.” His change of heart has cost him dearly: The evangelical nonprofit he founded, Faith and Action in the Nation’s Capital, lost 20% of its funding after he broke political ranks on the issue of guns. He’s had to step down.

As Schenck tells his story, the staff at the Club hovers over our table; it’s clear he’s known and loved there. With his long arms and glasses, he exudes deep empathy and humility, and can hardly resist ministering to me when he hears I’ve recently lost my mother. He never hesitates when he talks, even during what must be the painful parts of his story.

The day of the Navy Yard shooting, he says, he grabbed his prayer stole and Bible and headed to the scene to pray. Twelve people died that day, and three others were wounded. He began to question the idea that gun rights were absolute. When he first shared his intention to speak up in favor of gun control with leaders among his membership base of 300 churches and allied organizations, “there were immediate threats,” he said. “People told me, if you go down this road, you won’t get another dime of my money.

He says it’s been painful. “I don’t like losing relationships. These people have been colleagues for 25 or 30 years,” he says. “Long time colleagues came after me on Facebook like trolls.”

Schenck is the only person to speak with me on the record about the implied and real threats aimed at people in the folds of the right-wing gun community who have developed doubts about absolutes when it comes to gun rights. But two other owners of businesses that operate in the gun world reached out after interviews to retract some of their statements about the political positions and tactics of gun rights organizations.

Schenck came into the conservative Republican tribe in the 1980s, on the abortion issue. He’d converted to Christianity from Judaisim as a teen-ager.  A rising star in the evangelical movement, he carried a fetus he called Baby Tia, in his hands in a protest in Buffalo – an image I remembered from my high school days at the height of the abortion controversy.

Over the years, he had embraced the other tenets of Republicanism and become, as other evangelical leaders were, deeply enmeshed in the party. Faith and Action in the Nation’s Capital had seven employees, a membership base of 225,000 evangelicals, and a budget of $2.3 million.

Schenck had opposed gay marriage. He’d protested outside Terry Schiavo’s hospital. He’d given Roy Moore a 10 Commandments Award. And he supported gun rights.

But he’d long been troubled by that stance and those close to him knew it. Growing up in a suburban community, he didn’t have an emotional attachment to guns. He’d been called to minister to the families of the girls killed and wounded in the Amish school shooting and been moved by the forgiveness of the Amish elders.

Four years ago, Schenck got a proposal to be featured in a documentary about the seeming contradiction at the heart of evangelical support for guns: How can you cherish every human life from conception and not be at least concerned with unlocked guns, accidental shootings and suicides? If you follow a faith that calls for people to turn the other cheek, shouldn’t you question a gun rights agenda that promotes shooting in self-defense?

The filmmaker was Abigail Disney, the film, The Armor of Light, later won an Emmy. (disclosure: Disney is a client of mine and introduced me to Schenck). Lucy McBath, who lost her son Jordan to gun violence, was also featured and is now running for Congress.

During the making of the film, Schenck decided that there are no simple answers to the gun question. He began to preach, not for political measures, but for people to consider whether carrying a gun for self-defense was Christ-like.

“I understand the thinking,” he says. “We have to arm ourselves against a potentially tyrannical government. It’s a healthy thing to question unrestrained power.”

“But I’ve shot an AR-15. Any gun designed like this is engineered to appeal to our sense of pride and dominance. You know the dopamine hit that comes from it. it’s exciting. It’s titillating.”

It seems to him fundamentally in conflict to the idea that Christ taught, that the path to greatness is through humility. “You don’t impose your will on others. You become subservient to them.”

As he began to publicly express his doubts, his Republican and evangelical donors were true to their word. In June, the Faith and Action board of directors, he says, voted to transfer all the assets, program and personnel to another organization – he says he can’t say which one. “I was expected to step aside, which I did,” Schenck told me later, by email. “So, F&A will continue, but without me.”

As he re-examined his stance on gun rights, he re-examined other positions, too, including gay marriage and abortion rights. He’s slipped from the right to the left. To him that's less a political move and more one that's in keeping with his faith: it means he is standing for the simple teachings of the Sermon on the Mount, faith, hope and love.

In practical terms, that means Schenck is starting over again as he turns 60 this October. He’s founded the Dietrich Bonhoeffer Institute to continue his ministry in Washington and to publicize and promote the thinking of the German theologian who lost his life standing up to the Nazis.

Schenck picks up bullhorns again, but to speak out for gun control. When he gets invitations to preach now, his sermons have different themes, though they are still often to conservative churches.

At a Good Friday sermon to 1,200 in New Jersey soon after the Muslim ban, he talked about the grave site donated to Jesus by a stranger, Joseph of Arimathea. The fact that Jesus didn’t have one suggested that he was impoverished and estranged from his community, a wanderer among his own, Schenck writes in his book.

“The congregation seemed paralyzed in silence for those 15 minutes as I spoke about feeling lost or estranged, about being the black sheep in a family or community. ‘If you’re lost, you have a Savior,’ I concluded. ‘If you’re orphaned, you have a Heavenly Father, if you’re an alien, you have a country, if you’re alone, you have friends.’”

Silence met the end of the sermon, but then slowly, Schenck relates, the congregation rose to clap, row after row. “I don’t know what was going on in their minds, but I hoped in that moment they understood something about themselves and about all of us … We are creations of God, every one, from the best to the worst.”

When I reached out to update this story this week, Schenck told me he’s had to resign his membership at the University Club, which was too expensive.

“I’ve gone from a private suite with full bath on the 3rd floor to a 6x6 cubicle in a shared office space downtown. Instead of eating at private clubs and tony restaurants, I pack my lunch in a paper bag or eat at a food truck where I can get three tacos for $8! But it’s where I want to be, and I am at peace.”

This article was clarified to reflect the fact that the Evangelical Church Alliance does not formally endorse candidates for political office.",None
"Agile is the buzzword of the moment. Every day we read about the necessity of developing agile organizations—but shouldn’t we be talking about agile people?

Agile teams and organizations stress speed, experimentation, continuous learning, role mobility and flexible resource allocation, which are key to competitiveness. I’m concerned that there’s a missing element so obvious we take it for granted. According to the World Economic Forum and Boston Consulting Group research, agile transformation requires nothing less than a on the part of every employee. In a time when we need agility in business, we need agility in life. We need agile people.

Deep down in the charts, graphs and bullet points showing how to change an organization, note that employees who are asked to adopt a radically new way of working need to adopt a radically new way of thinking and feeling about work, including the ability to reinvent, the courage to fail fast and the empathy to work well in diverse teams. They need to communicate constantly, be accountable, be customer-focused and above all be open to change. Are your employees mentally and emotionally equipped with the resilience to handle this radical change?

The urgent need to reinvent companies as agile teams makes resilience a competitive advantage. Resilience empowers employees and leaders to develop greater emotional intelligence and self-awareness. And resilience helps people focus under pressure, manage their impulses, solve problems creatively. These are important building blocks for agile teams.

Every employee must learn the skills that make them adaptable, help them deal with stress and remain emotionally connected to work. Resilience enables all three. When leaders and employees embrace these skills, powerful things happen.

A Fortune 50 company I work with has an award-winning healthy lifestyles practice, but because it is an information technology firm, its people are continuously assaulted by the speed of change. In response, leaders and employees built a company-wide resilience initiative that focused on each individual developing personal skills according to their needs. Not surprisingly, many tech-oriented employees at this firm took a logic-based approach to an emotional challenge, identifying exactly what was causing stress and tackling it head-on with dispassionate analysis and new work styles, such as handling difficult customer calls with emotion control or dealing with a work challenge with flexibility and focus. They are more self-aware and adaptable. With resilience, employees are learning to manage the relentless changes with confidence.

Transitioning to a new way of working is inherently stressful—a situation that can reinforce ineffective thinking styles (habitual thoughts and feelings that are mistaken or negative). A media technology company employing over 100,000 people discovered that stress was the main cause of its high absenteeism rate. Existing programs featuring employee assistance, yoga and meditation were helpful but hard to scale among its many call-center employees. They implemented a resilience program that taught employees to catch themselves in negative thinking, step back and open their minds to alternative interpretations of a stressful situation. They learned to manage emotions, manage anxiety, set aside distractions and navigate around negative reactions to stress. These are all learnable skills that preserve a sense of personal security.

Collaboration among teams is a defining characteristic of organizational agility, and personal agility strengthens when employees practice resilience in collaboration with a like-minded community. Good teamwork is mutually supportive. As organizational behavior expert Jeffrey Pfeffer recently noted in McKinsey Quarterly, social support is essential to a sense of well-being on the job. Employees engaged in resilience training develop a sense of community in two ways: In their team or department, resilience exercises and activities build cohesiveness and trust. Across the organization, resilience metrics give everyone a picture of how the company as a whole is managing radical change.

Employee engagement is critical to agile transformation when a transition period demands extra effort on everyone’s part. While we can’t prevent employees from feeling apprehension at the prospect of new structures and processes that upend their work lives, we can focus resilience training on the skills they need to stay engaged. In fact, the act of learning new personal management skills reinforces a sense of effectiveness, which is key to engagement. A virtuous cycle goes into effect, as employees realize that because they possess the skills to change their outlook, they have the skills to embrace change. They stay in the game.

"When trying to foster a workplace that is equitable and inclusive for all, it is imperative for leaders to be well-trained in inclusive strategies. There is one key trait that all great leaders should possess. Some may call this trait the crème de la crème of all leadership traits: empathy. Empathy is our ability to put ourselves in the shoes of others and to understand what another person is experiencing. Leaders that are more empathetic may be more effective at fostering diverse and inclusive workplaces. How can organizations assess the empathy levels of prospective employees? And how can leaders develop and increase their empathy?

Everyone’s level of empathy is different. To gauge your level of empathy, an empathy test can be enlisted in order to understand where you stand. Empathy is one of the key determinants of emotional intelligence. Those who are more empathetic tend to also be more emotionally intelligent. It would be beneficial for organizations to include some sort of empathy measure when evaluating job candidates, and particularly those seeking leadership roles in the company. Leaders should be assessed for empathy at the start of their employment. It’s good to have an understanding of an employee’s empathy levels, but it’s important to understand that empathy is also a trait that can be developed. During performance reviews and evaluations, leaders can be coached on increasing their empathy skills. Empathy training should be incorporated into the annual training that employees receive and should be done on a continuous and ongoing basis.

For leaders who want to develop and increase their empathy for others, there are a few different tactics that can be employed.

Empathy is an essential quality that each leader in every organization should possess. While it’s effective to measure empathy levels of each job applicant to ensure you are hiring employees that possesses this critical trait, employees can also be coached and trained on how to develop their empathy levels, helping to foster a more inclusive workplace.",productivity
"What I've found is that to be truly happy in life, you have to elevate it to a state of joy. Yes, there is a difference. Happiness is fleeting. Joy is sustainable.

You can slurp down three heaping scoops of Ben & Jerry's Chunky Monkey ice cream and ""feel"" happy. But an hour later you may feel the same way as before.

Joy, on the other hand, is not restricted to an emotion, as happiness is. It's a permanent state of mental, emotional, and even spiritual well-being. It's achieving life satisfaction, balance, peace, and being resilient in the face of adversity. That's joy.

Whether you call it joy or happiness, to strive to reach this state, there are many things a person can do to elevate it.

Studies published in BPS Research have found that sharing the good things that happen in your life can raise happiness levels. In one study, participants who journaled and shared positive experiences with another person at least twice a week were more satisfied with life.

We all have a tendency to work too much and feel that if we don't do something productive every day, we've somehow failed. Slow down and eliminate the need to strive and be perfect. You'll begin to appreciate and focus on other, neglected priorities that bring you joy.

Empathy starts with thinking about other people's circumstances, understanding their pains and frustrations, and knowing that those emotions are every bit as real as our own. This helps you develop perspective, and opens you up to helping others, which also enhances your sense of gratitude and joy.

Start your day by being grateful for what you have. As it turns out, if you make more than $30,000, you earn more than 53.2 percent of Americans. If you make more than $50,000, you earn more than 73.4 percent of Americans. Offer up a little prayer and give thanks, it could be a lot worse.

Patience is a virtue not enough people practice in our frantic pace of life. But it helps you relax and rethink when things are snowballing out of control. It helps you see the innocence in other people during those really frustrating moments when you'd like fist to meet wall.

Researchers have found that when you respond to good news from a colleague with energy, excitement, curiosity, and enthusiasm, it not only makes that person feel good, it makes you feel more positive. They call it ""active and constructive responding (ACR)."" An ACR response might be, ""That's fantastic! I had no doubts you would get that promotion--let's celebrate!"" By showing interest, you'll maintain strong personal relationships and raise your happiness levels in the process.

Psychologist and best-selling author Shawn Achor told Oprah that you can literally train your brain to be happy and optimistic if you journal three things you are grateful for every day for 21 days in a row. And while you're at it, Achor also told Oprah that if you spend two minutes daily journaling about one positive experience in the past 24 hours, it allows your brain to relive it, and teaches your brain that the behavior matters.

Humor helps you think more broadly and creatively, according to psychologists. In one study, they had students solve puzzles after watching a clip of Robin Williams doing standup comedy. Twenty percent more puzzles were solved by sudden insight from students who had watched comedy compared with students who had watched scary or boring videos beforehand. There are other benefits: Laughter releases endorphins into the body--a chemical 10 times more powerful than morphine--with the same exhilarating effect as an intense workout at the gym.

9. Bring more fun to your job.

Science has found that people who have fun on the job are more creative and productive, make better decisions, and get along better with colleagues. Another study discovered that to unlock your creative potential, ""go out and play"" to lift your mood, and then come back to the problem.

For 30 to 60 minutes after you wake up, remove yourself from the noise, clutter, distractions, screaming kids, and busyness of life. Go out into the stillness of the morning, find your favorite spot, close your eyes, breathe through your stomach, and center yourself. Now you're in the position to meditate on the good things of life. Setting aside this little ritual makes the rest of your day seem manageable and brings you peace and joy. You'll notice a difference and a weight off your shoulders.",wellness
"""Do I read this email now or later? Do I file it? Do I forward it? Do I have to get more information? Do I put it in the spam folder? -- that's a handful of decisions right there, and you haven't done anything meaningful. It puts us into a brain state of decision fatigue."" -- Daniel Levitin

The e-mail message is, theoretically, supposed to be a simple thing. It is a fast and easy method of communication, and takes mere seconds to complete and send to colleagues, business partners, and recipients around the world.

But for such an uncomplicated messaging system, it sure can cause a lot of problems -- particularly when it comes to work.

It turns out you don't have to actually even be sending a lot of work email to feel its negative effects -- a new study shows that simply expecting to check work email can have major detrimental effects on your health, well-being, and family relationships.

The study, ""Killing Me Softly: Electronic Communications Monitoring and Employee and Significant-Other Well-Being,"" showed that when an employee expects to monitor work email during non-work hours, feelings of anxiety are triggered, thus endangering work and personal lives.

Being readily available for work-related tasks is found to ""increase strain for employees and their significant others"" -- even when actual work during non-work time is not even being performed.

This is a different kind of effect created by work-related demands that require time away from home. William Becker, Virginia Tech associate professor of management and co-author of the study, says ""Our research exposes the reality: 'flexible work boundaries' often turn into 'work without boundaries,' compromising an employee's and their family's health and well-being."" The ""impact of 'always on' organizational culture is ""insidious,"" and often unaccounted for says Becker.

So what is the key to improving work and family life? As an employer, recognize that expecting your workers to be available for work items and e-mail monitoring 24/7 is not healthy, not productive, and costly. Reduce expectations and communicate them clearly.

As an employee, practice mindfulness, which is known to be effective for reducing anxiety and improving family relationship satisfaction. Remember to ""be present"" in your interactions, and do not be afraid to close your laptop and put away your phone. You may soon find that the benefits of better family relationships far outweigh any loss of business productivity you might experience outside the office.",wellness
"In my continuing efforts to clearly demonstrate how love--the most powerful human emotion on the planet--is generated and leveraged for business results, I've interviewed several high-profile human-centered leaders to answer the question, ""How do you love your people well?""

In the end, that's what exceptional leadership boils down to: love. More specifically, so we don't make the HR and legal folks nervous, love here is actionable and noble: creating psychological safety, connecting with employees, caring for their well-being, and not just managing their work performance.

While not many people are calling it for what it is, actionable love shown in how employees are treated has been proven to raise performance and increase value, loyalty, and engagement. This is what every company should be after.

For this interview, I reached out to a loving leader--Kyle Slager, CEO of San Diego-based Raken, the top-rated daily reporting app and field management software for the construction industry. Back in June, Slager caught my attention when he was named 2018's Most Admired CEO for a small, privately held company by the San Diego Business Journal.

I dove in to find out how Slager is wired as a human leader, and how he demonstrates love in action for business outcomes at Raken. I came away with three outstanding takeaways.

Love your employees by growing them as people.

Slager has based Raken's leadership philosophy on a ""holistic approach, in which we support each other."" Holding true to servant leadership form, holistically supporting employees can be a scary proposition and, in Raken's case, extends beyond where most companies are willing to venture: helping people achieve their personal goals as much as their professional goals.

""One of the things we've done to formalize this is make it part of our review process.  For example, we'll set personal goals for the year the same way we would professional goals, and we do everything we can to help each other achieve those goals,"" says Slager.

Love your company by fiercely protecting its culture.

Peter Drucker famously quipped, ""Culture eats strategy for breakfast."" The premise held by Drucker is that a company's culture will trump any effort by a management team to enforce a strategy that is incompatible with that culture. In the end, it's culture that wins.

The traditional top-down hierarchy is flipped upside down in how Raken operates as a business, with customers at the top and team members (employees) that serve those customers right below. Slager says, ""The rest of our team is here to support the people on the front lines interacting with our customers every day. Customer success = our success.""

Culture is defined by guiding principles and shared values by which Raken hires and lives as a company. ""All expectations we have at Raken are based off agreements. That goes for business goals, personal goals, and our culture,"" says Slager.

Before anyone joins the Raken team, they have to agree to Raken's high cultural standards. ""They agree because that's the culture they want to be a part of and that's how they want to show up every day,"" Slager told me. They are:

Slager shared with me that Raken was founded on the rare virtue of empathy. What that means in a business sense is that, to provide more value than anyone else in the construction market, Kyle's team learned to first understand their customers on a deeper level than ever before.

And for that to happen, they had to spend more time with their customers--at the jobsite and in the office. Reaching down to a real human level of understanding about their customers' true needs, Raken's mission evolved with great clarity ""to create the fastest, easiest-to-use solutions for the construction field.""

Slager told me that the vast majority of companies in his industry have failed because they didn't ""get"" their clients and were more focused on adding bells and whistles to their product than providing real value.

""I think it's very hard to succeed if you're more in love with your product than your customer in any market, even more so in construction,"" says Slager.",productivity
"There are what business types called pain points involved and the pain isn't getting any better, especially when they go to the bathroom.

In this video from 2015, they explain just how bad things have become. And, let's be honest, it's even worse now.

Well, as Copeland himself explains in this video, they're in show business. They understand what it takes to make people feel good and feel damnably awful.

The mess that the airlines are in today, I would have to stop...I'm being very conservative...at least 75 to 80, more like 90 percent of what we're doing, 'cause you can't get there from here.

Is it really so bad? Some airlines are increasing their capacity. Some are working hard to give passengers the right connections.

Copeland told the story of televangelist Oral Roberts, who used to fly commercial but became tired of people coming up to him and wanting him to pray for them.

""You can't manage that today, this dope-filled world"" said Copeland. ""And get in a long tube with a bunch of demons.""

When I'm on a plane, I look around me and consider who might behave demonically and who might be on the right side of human.

Copeland told the story because he didn't want anyone to think that he and his fellow televangelists who have their own planes are ""fat cats riding around.""

""We're in show business here,"" says Copeland. ""We've got a dying world around us. We've got a dying nation around us. And we can't even get there on the airlines.""

He was in Fort Worth on Friday night and Saturday. On Sunday, he was in Boston. On Monday, he was in New Orleans. On Tuesday, he was in Chicago. On Wednesday, he was in Raleigh, North Carolina. On Thursday, he was back in New Orleans. On Friday, he was in San Antonio. On Saturday, he was in New Orleans. On Sunday, he was, well, he couldn't even remember.

Some might say this schedule is no different from so many warriors who pound the roads while flying the skies.

"Hope is not a strategy. At face value, that seems obvious; of course you wouldn’t incorporate “hope” into any official strategic plan. But realistically, everyone from the highest-level CEO to the hustling entrepreneur has occasionally thought, “I hope that what I’m doing works out the way I want it to.” It’s a natural human reaction — but you can’t count on hope for success, especially when it comes to recruiting the talent that your organization needs.

Whether dealing with long-term goals or day-to-day tasks, relying on hope to get the results you want is rarely a sustainable solution. In business contexts, “hope” is often a sneaky synonym for “luck” — and a winning lottery ticket isn’t likely to bring your organization the candidates you’ve been waiting for.

Fortunately, you don’t need hope or luck to recruit at the highest level. With the right strategy in place, you can take chance out of your approach altogether. Let’s take a look at five ways that you can stop using hope as a game plan.

The busier your schedule gets, the more important it becomes for you to take time away from the chaos to reflect. Although it may seem paradoxical to stop working when you have the most work to do, it’s important to check in with yourself to ensure you’re making positive, informed decisions.

Try using a journal for this type of reflection. Tuning out the texts and emails for a moment may actually improve your ability to process them later, and you can return to work with more energy and focus.

We’ve all had colleagues who were less competent or committed than us and have experienced frustration when their sloppy mistakes became messes we had to clean up. But focusing on the perceived shortcomings of others can often allow us to shirk the blame.

Before passing the blame next time someone drops the ball, consider how you can alter your own actions in the future to prevent or minimize damage. Maybe you could communicate more clearly. Maybe you could vet freelancers or new candidates more thoroughly in the future. Consider what you can control instead of pointing toward what you can’t.

A friend of mine has a great mantra: “Don’t look out the window — look in the mirror.” When something goes wrong, it’s unhelpful to spend time looking for external factors that caused the problem. You’ll never be able to change unexpected circumstances; all you can do is be prepared for them.

When something goes awry, evaluate every factor that caused your plan to derail — external and internal — and make a note of new learnings. See failure as an opportunity, not an excuse.

It’s important to continually assess how much effort you’re dedicating to creating and sustaining success — and how much you’re leaving to chance. One way to do this is to compare yourself to peers and competitors. Consider who’s getting better results and what they might be doing that you’re not. Are they spending more time on certain activities? Are they noticeably more effective in one particular area? It can also be helpful to seek input from an accountability partner who can offer an unbiased assessment of your skills and effort.

If you’re truly giving your full effort and still not experiencing the results you want, it’s possible that your plate is simply too full. Consider delegating nonessential tasks or making other tweaks in your recruitment strategy.

The old saying “fish or cut bait” doesn’t just apply to big water — it also applies to your professional journey. It’s imperative that you commit to your daily tasks, your big picture goals and your organization’s larger mission. If you don’t believe in the work you’re doing, you’ll never be entirely committed to it. Consider which parts of your organization’s values motivate you to do the work. If there aren’t any, it may be time to consider moving on.

These five strategies require near-constant thought and reflection; if your heart isn’t in it, you’ll have a very difficult time removing “hope” from your game plan. But if you find purpose in your work and remain motivated to succeed in your industry, each of these exercises can come naturally to you — and pay off in the long run.",None
"White men were once a majority in America's workforce, but for decades their numbers have been dwindling. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, by 2005, white males will make up only 38% of the workforce and, by 2008, women and people of color will account for about 70% of new workers. In other words, knowing how to manage diversity gains more importance with each passing year. Yet most corporate diversity programs simply shield companies from legal penalties under federal nondiscrimination statutes, when what's really needed is a way to move beyond the defensive goal of expunging discrimination toward the next step -- inclusiveness.

Inclusiveness is a strategy to unleash the power of diversity to generate business value. It involves creating opportunities throughout an organization so that the talents of all employees can be fully realized. And it extends beyond strictly embracing legal dictates associated with the ""protected categories"" of discrimination law, which include race, gender, religion, age, and disability.

Of course the issues surrounding protected categories are important. Gallup surveys show that many members of these categories, particularly African-Americans, feel discriminated against in the workplace. In the fall of 2001, for example, we conducted a poll of 2,004 randomly selected adults in the U.S., which revealed that 44% of blacks but only 10% of whites feel that blacks are treated unfairly on the job.

But protected categories represent a relatively narrow subset of differences between workers; diversity covers the entire spectrum of human differences, including physical characteristics, educational backgrounds, experiences, and preferences. As a tool to leverage diversity, inclusiveness focuses on using the unique strengths of each employee to increase the productivity and profitability of an organization.

How does an executive exercise the power that comes from these strengths? As the old business adage has it, ""If you don't measure it, you can't manage it."" In 2000 a mid-size health-care services company asked us to design a survey to measure inclusiveness. Analysis of the results showed that attitudes about inclusiveness varied across the company, and that workgroups with the lowest inclusiveness scores had lower productivity and retention scores than those with higher inclusiveness scores.

Our research in this case and in other surveys conducted since then is laying the foundation for a system to measure an organization's success at creating and maintaining inclusive environments. Based on thousands of employee interviews, we identified a list of 10 questions that, when asked of employees, indicate how inclusive a company is and how effective it is at managing diversity. The questions that constitute Gallup's Inclusiveness10, or I10, are:

By regularly auditing employees' answers to these questions, an organization can assess the degree to which employees feel included. It can also garner valuable information about legal compliance issues, even though the I10 does not address such issues directly. The research shows that answers to the I10 correlate strongly with perceptions of fairness in hiring and promotion.

More to the point: Once such regular audits are in place, organizations can begin to study their progress in inclusiveness and how it relates to positive business outcomes. And that's the key. Studying the measurable links between inclusiveness and positive business outcomes (such as retention, profitability, and productivity) is the secret to harnessing the business value of workforce diversity.",None
"Recently there has been an increased focus on the importance of including women in leadership positions, including on boards. But apart from the obvious reason of legal equality, why is a policy of mixed-gender board representation important?

Studies show that especially in stressful environments, males tend to take more risks in life than females. In business, where bets often need to be hedged, female leadership—which tends to be slightly more risk-averse—can provide invaluable balance. When an organization is out of balance, it may act “out of ethics.” The damage this does to the company’s reputation, and the harm done to those affected by these actions takes serious effort to rectify.

Women directors are associated with less aggressive investment policies, better acquisition decisions and improved firm performance overall. This stereotypical reluctance to rush in is partly why at least family firms incorporate more female directors and board members.

One can also argue that many workplace fiascos currently being addressed by organizations such as the #metoo movement, as well as the proliferation of “penned manifestos,” could have been avoided had those boards had more female members steering and guiding the organizations from above.

In this age of personal gender identification, many still think of the feminine principle as nurturing, guiding and embodying a less aggressive stance in general. The classic maternal approach utilizes both hard and soft power, and this maternal approach can be incredibly useful in the workplace.

By bringing a more balanced dynamic to the workplace, organizations can benefit from strong direction in a caring manner, to build future-facing organizations where employees are encouraged to venture out into the unknown and make mistakes to help move the company forward.

Since 2008, Scandinavian countries such as Norway have been veritable fair play (and fair pay) pioneers by legally requiring 40% female board representation. Since then many European countries have followed suit, and today France has an even higher percentage of women serving on company boards. Ten years down the line, however, not much has changed as far as boosting female employees up the corporate ladder in general, nor have the regulations made a difference in narrowing the pay gap between male and female employees on lower rungs.

In the U.S. women hold less than 20% of S&P 500 companies’ board seats, possibly as a result of legal requirements concerning female board representation. One argument against legal requirements is the risk of becoming the “token” female: no one wants to be brought on board based on his or her gender rather than skills or experience.

A study of 1,000 family firms in Sweden found that female leadership has far more positive impact on the performance of family firms versus non-family firms. One reason could be that families are more accustomed to female representation at the board level and therefore more comfortable having important decisions that rest with female decision makers.

Your Organization Is Your Family

Most people spend more time with their work families than their own, so perhaps it makes sense to start looking at an organization as a second family. By doing this, and structuring it in the same way, the female leadership on a board level might not only be approached from a reputation angle or quota level (legal or otherwise) but rather as something to be embraced.",
"Leaders have long recognized that a diverse workforce of women, people of color, and LGBT individuals confers a competitive edge in terms of selling products or services to diverse end users. Yet a stark gap persists between recognizing the leadership behaviors that unlock this capability and actually practicing them.

Part of the problem is that “diversity” and “inclusion” are so often lumped together that they’re assumed to be the same thing. But that’s just not the case. In the context of the workplace, diversity equals representation. Without inclusion, however, the crucial connections that attract diverse talent, encourage their participation, foster innovation, and lead to business growth won’t happen. As noted diversity advocate Vernā Myers puts it, “Diversity is being invited to the party. Inclusion is being asked to dance.”

Numerous studies show that diversity alone doesn’t drive inclusion. In fact, without inclusion there’s often a diversity backlash. Our research on sponsorship and multicultural professionals, for example, shows that although 41% of senior-level African-Americans, 20% of senior-level Asians, and 18% of senior-level Hispanics feel obligated to sponsor employees of the same gender or ethnicity as themselves (for Caucasians the number is 7%), they hesitate to take action. Sponsors of color, especially at the top, are hobbled by the perception of giving special treatment to protégés of color and the concern that protégés might not “make the grade.” The result: Just 18% of Asians, 21% of African-Americans, and 25% of Hispanics step up to sponsorship (and 27% of Caucasians).

Another difficulty in solving the issue is data. It’s easy to measure diversity: It’s a simple matter of headcount. But quantifying feelings of inclusion can be dicey. Understanding that narrative along with the numbers is what really draws the picture for companies.

For example, we worked with a Chile-based firm that would seem to have no problems with diversity. After all, one of their most valued employees is an indigenous Peruvian, a man who is respected, well-paid, and included in the leadership team’s decision-making discussions. Yet in a one-on-one interview he confided that he saw no future for his ambitions at that firm. “I know they value me,” he said, “but I am an indigenous person, and they are white, legacy, and Spanish. They will never make me a partner, because of my color and background.” Conventional measures would never flag this talented man for a flight risk; it’s up to the narrative to tell the tale.

At the Center for Talent Innovation, we have constructed a unique, robust framework for measuring the things that matter. Our methodology relies on three streams of information: wide-ranging, anonymous, quantitative surveys provide the statistical foundation; Insights In-Depth sessions, a proprietary web-based tool used to conduct facilitated focus groups within companies, provide the stories to flesh out the statistics; and one-on-one interviews enrich the statistics with deeper meaning. Within that framework our research has uncovered four levers that drive inclusion.

Inclusive leaders. This kind of leadership is a conglomeration of six behaviors: ensuring that team members speak up and are heard; making it safe to propose novel ideas; empowering team members to make decisions; taking advice and implementing feedback; giving actionable feedback; and sharing credit for team success. Of employees who report that their team leader has at least three of these traits, 87% say they feel welcome and included in their team, 87% say they feel free to express their views and opinions, and 74% say they feel that their ideas are heard and recognized. For respondents who reported that their team leader has none of these traits, those percentages dropped to 51%, 46%, and 37%, respectively.

Authenticity. It’s not surprising that everyone expends energy by repressing parts of their persona in the workplace in some way. But according to our research, 37% of African-Americans and Hispanics and 45% of Asians say they “need to compromise their authenticity” to conform to their company’s standards of demeanor or style. Our research on women in the science, engineering, and technology industries shows that, regardless of gender, acting “like a man” can provide an advantage in becoming a leader in these fields. What a waste of employees’ energy, let alone their employers’ diversity dollars.

Networking and visibility. For women and people of color, the key to rising above a playing field that remains stubbornly uneven is sponsorship. A sponsor is a senior-level leader who elevates their protégé’s visibility within the corridors of power, advocates for key assignments and promotions for them, and puts their reputation on the line for the protégé’s advancement. For those who feel marginalized by their gender, ethnicity, age, sexual identity, or educational and economic background, sponsorship is particularly crucial in invigorating ambition and driving engagement. Having a sponsor increases the likelihood of being satisfied with the rate of career advancement. Conversely, lack of sponsorship increases someone’s likelihood of quitting within a year.

Clear career paths. For women, LGBT individuals, and people of color, the map to career success is murky. Our research shows that 45% of women off-ramp to take care of children, although elder care is increasingly pulling women off the career track, with 24% leaving to care for aging relatives. But a significant number of women also feel pushed off the ladder: 29% say their career isn’t satisfying, and 23% feel stalled in their careers. Comments from women in focus groups note that they’re frustrated by being passed over for high-profile assignments, and they have a general sense of missing out on the right opportunities. LGBT individuals and people of color, too, struggle to name a simple solution to open up a blocked career path. Ironically, it’s usually the majority group that presumes to identify the reason these people aren’t advancing, which too often results in the problem being oversimplified.

Companies should start from the simple but fundamental understanding that there are different perspectives, each of them valuable, and work to explore and identify the range of barriers holding these individuals back. Organizations can then formulate plans and programs that offer options and provide signposts that help women, LGBT people, and people of color find the path that’s right for where they are in their lives and careers.

Focusing on these four levers can elicit real change. Our research finds that employees with inclusive managers are 1.3 times more likely to feel that their innovative potential is unlocked. Employees who are able to bring their whole selves to work are 42% less likely to say they intend to leave their job within a year. Those with sponsors are 62% more likely to have asked for and have received a promotion. And 69% of women who off-ramp would have stayed at their companies if they’d had flexible work options.

Diversity without inclusion is a story of missed opportunities, of employees so used to being overlooked that they no longer share ideas and insights. But diversity with inclusion provides a potent mix of talent retention and engagement.",coaching
"Do you have a colleague who is subject to special treatment while everyone else gets pushed aside? Are you the one praised incessantly by the boss, or the go-to person for all the great projects? It’s no secret that the playing field among workers isn’t level in most workplaces—and chances are you’ve been on one end of blatant favoritism at some point in your career.

It turns out that this widespread practice of favoritism can have a significant impact, whether you’re the victim or the VIP. A survey conducted by Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business found that 92% of senior business executives have seen favoritism at play in employee promotions, including at their own companies (84%). About a quarter of the polled execs admitted to practicing favoritism themselves.

“Favoritism is absolutely seen in most offices, big or small,” says Ryan Kahn, a career coach, founder of The Hired Group, star of MTV’s Hired, and author of Hired! The Guide for the Recent Grad. “People enjoy working with friends, which often inadvertently turns into favoritism.  It can start as something as simple as being included on a lunch outing where business is discussed and may lead to something much more substantial, like getting salary and promotional benefits.  Wanting to work with people you like is fine, as long as it is fair to other employees.”

Lynn Taylor, a national workplace expert and author of Tame Your Terrible Office Tyrant; How to Manage Childish Boss Behavior and Thrive in Your Job, agrees. She says favoritism in the workplace is as common as the office water cooler, but a lot more toxic. “It’s like the old familiar teacher’s pet syndrome from grade school,” she says. “One or more employees are chosen to handle the better, more senior, higher visibility projects—making others who are equally or more qualified feel as if the boss is not playing fair. Favoritism can be fairly benign in some situations, but it can also be much more serious and develop into a hostile environment for others.”

Favoritism is human nature, says Mark Payleitner, a business career program instructor at Computer Systems Institute. “We start out with a favorite toy and grow from there,” he adds. “When a boss assigns a critical, high-profile project to one individual, she hopefully selects the best person for the job. But when she gives a friend the office with the best view based on no other criteria, that crosses into favoritism.”

Teri Hockett, the chief executive of What’s For Work?, a career site for women, concurs. She says it’s healthy for management to favor and reward an employee who is always willing to collaborate and offer up real solutions.“This can even motivate employees to deliver better results,” she says. But when the boss favors someone in the office without real merit, there may be serious consequences.

“It’s important for employees to distinguish favoritism from performance recognition,” Kahn says. “With my own clients, I’ve had instances where they’ve seen peers getting opportunities they were not receiving and perceiving that as favoritism.  On further investigation, it turned out those employees were working extra hours, going above and beyond to earn the confidence of their employer and, ultimately, earning those chances for advancement.  My clients were then able to follow their lead, but in the extra effort and secure the same opportunities.”

How can unhealthy favoritism impact the workplace?

Beyond potential legal implications, there are many negative consequences, Kahn says.  “By not treating everyone equally, a manager is fostering a sense of resentment and separation that can de-motivate employees and damage team unity,” he says. “Also, by focusing attention on particular employees, it’s easy to overlook growth opportunities and unique skill sets offered by others.”

Hockett adds that by not giving other team members an opportunity to shine, the boss is not allowing the team or company to grow, which can cost the company more money in the long run. “There’s also a chance that the employer may lose good people, if they feel their talents are going unnoticed,” she adds.

Payleitner says unearned favoritism also “leads to the unselected believing that your efforts will not be recognized fairly; that the yardstick for success has nothing to do with performance.”

So, if you suspect you are the one being favored unfairly, “taking on the role of an inclusive team member can be an asset,” says Marsha Egan, a workplace and e-mail productivity coach, CEO of InboxDetox.com and author of Inbox Detox and the Habit of E-mail Excellence (Acanthus 2009). “Suggesting the names of other capable candidates for opportunities, and sharing positive comments about team members’ performance, and other inclusive behaviors can be useful. To jealously guard being favored may help you with your boss, but it will not help you with your associates.”

What else can you do if you’re the favored employee?

Speak up. Have a conversation with your boss or with HR to figure out how to correct the situation, Kahn says. “Ultimately, there is no upside to favoritism.  If you’re being singled out as a favorite and advancing purely because of that, you’re going to end up in a position you’re not qualified for surrounded by resentful and unsupportive peers.”  If you’re earning the opportunities you’re receiving, but others are perceiving it as a favoritism, they may just be undermining your hard work.

Be able to say no. “If you feel uncomfortable with the direction of the relationship, act sooner versus later,” Taylor says. Say something like, “I have so much work on my plate; what do you think of my sharing this project with James? I think he’s got some time on his hands that would make this stronger, and we could be a good team.” “By sharing some of the work and glory, you’ll make your work life a lot more palatable overall,” she adds.

Whenever possible, share the lime-light, Payleitner says. This is true of almost any professional situation, but critical when others may feel the attention is undeserved.

Keep it professional, Taylor says. You’re not at work to amuse or befriend your boss, and feeding into any over-the-top friendship will make it difficult for you to get cooperation from the people you most need it from: your peers. “You don’t want to be ostracized by your team any more than they want to be ostracized by the boss, or you’ll ultimately fail,” she says. “As in a sports team environment, you will need each other to succeed. If you don’t have their cooperation or trust, your success will be short-lived.”

Remain trustworthy, Payleitner says. “Trust is the first casualty of favoritism. If you feel you are the beneficiary of a favored status, you need to make sure you never offer a reason to doubt your sincerity and trustworthiness.”

Don’t accept the benefits of favoritism. While it is difficult to refuse the best office, the choice assignments, or the newest desk chair–it is important that you understand why you are selected, Payleitner says. “A ‘Wow – what did I do to deserve this?’ may be enough to make sure your boss gets things back on an even playing field.”

Figure out if you’re really a victim. “If you feel that you are the overlooked employee, first of all have a good conversation with yourself to make sure that you are not unnecessarily playing victim,” Egan says. “If the person being favored does truly perform better than you do, it is time to ramp up your performance to being equal or better than the performance of those you feel are being favored.”

Speak up. Do so diplomatically, Taylor says. “Don’t ambush your boss, no matter how long your tenure or relationship. Think it through, and script it to yourself privately first if need be.” You want to be clear, calm and concise.

Egan agrees. “You need to be judicious about confronting the favoring boss with your suspicions,” she says. “To accuse, or mention that others in the office are feeling that the boss is playing favorites with that one person, only makes you the rat, and creates defensiveness by the boss. It can really backfire. It is better to not discuss the favoritism, but to ask for opportunities, and offer to help, instead.”

Continue working hard. Be professional and do your part to show you care about the team, company, and clients, Hockett says. “Never allow unhealthy favoritism to affect the professional you are.”

Try to understand the reason for the special attention.  Is it a friendship or other relationship?  Is it because of a history or common experience together?  Is it simply a matter of habit or trust? Knowing this may help you determine whether it is fair or unfair favoritism, Payleitner says.

Don’t be angry with the favored employee. It’s usually not the employee’s fault that he or she receives special treatment—so don’t blame them or treat them poorly. As difficult as it might be, maintain a normal professional relationship with the favored worker.

Stay positive. In any situation where you suspect favoritism, remain positive and proactive. Allowing it to affect your performance or morale only creates a downward spiral, Egan says. “Talking about it with co-workers only makes you look bad, even though it may feel good at the time you’re doing it.”

Be patient. If the favorite is truly undeserving, be patient; the boss will eventually realize that it is in their own best interest to look around for a new go-to person, Payleitner says. “Make sure you’re on top of your game when that time comes.”

Call upon Human Resources. You never want to be a tattletale, but if you’ve tried everything else and nothing changes, then reach out to Human Resources to see what options are available, Hockett says.

Always keep the conversations going. “If favoritism is severe and you’re being ignored, you will have to be more aggressive in your communications,” Hockett says. “You may have to meet more regularly, and ask your boss if there are issues regarding your perceived ability to take on new assignments. You may have to talk to others in the department if the situation is egregious; there’s power in numbers. If so, you might consider telling your boss that many in the department would like more face time with him or her, and suggest more department lunches, for example.”

"It happens all the time. You're skimming through LinkedIn, Facebook, or some other social media site and see the announcement that some guy or gal you know just got a new job, promotion, sold their company, etc. At first, you rationalize that it must be a ""right place, right time"" situation. But then you recall this isn't the first time he or she has announced their success. You think to yourself, ""I don't get it. She wasn't that smart in school. And her personality was nothing special. What's she doing that I'm not?""

Those first five words say it all. You know all those people you see making things happen for themselves? Especially, the ones you secretly think you're smarter and more talented than? They truly believed they could do it. They didn't let negative self-talk plant too much doubt in their brains so that they failed to take action. Additionally, they believed enough to pick themselves up after every mistake or setback, and kept going until they got results. But most important, they also looked at those challenges differently. Here's how ...

When you focus all your attention on all the things you can't do (i.e., what you believe is holding you back), you squander the finite amount of energy you have on battling negativity. Those that achieve high levels of success train their attention to stay focused on solutions, possibilities, and the positive aspects of their situation. It's the only way they can keep their belief in themselves in check. I'm not suggesting you ignore problems and put on a fake smile. I'm encouraging you to develop the habit of using your attention wisely by approaching each challenge as an opportunity. Simply reframing how you see a situation can keep it from zapping your energy.

P.S.: Oprah Isn't the Only One Who Understands This

Ask all the people you know who are achieving their goals and they'll tell you they had to learn to shift their attention to stay focused on the positive. It's a habit that must be built up and strengthened -- just like a muscle. When I first started my company, I made the mistake of focusing my attention on the challenges. As a female bootstrapping her startup in a small seacoast town in New Hampshire, I was psyching myself out and draining my energy daily with negative self-talk. It wasn't until I retrained my brain to use these things as assets that I was able to take my business to the next level. Today, I teach my staff to do the same. The more they can see each day as a chance to get closer to our goals, regardless of what happened the day before, the sooner we get there. As my team and I say, ""If you want to win, you've got to Work It Daily!""",
"Throughout most of the 20th century, management practices were designed to maximize control over employees. From punch cards to ""management by objectives,"" employees were told what, when and how much they needed to do, and supervised closely. It is commonly believed that if left to their own devices, employees will do as little as possible to survive. And so, the primary job of managers is to closely motivate and manage employees to maximize productivity.

Thanks to 24/7 connectivity and the arrival of the gig economy, today’s 21st-century workforce is more empowered than ever before in human history. By some estimates, about 40% of the workforce in the U.S. and some European countries has already shunned traditional fulltime employment in favor of free agency. These free agents, by definition, have a lot of freedom. They decide when and how much to work. They don’t need to be micro-managed because they fully understand that their rewards depend directly on how much (and how well) they produce. According to experts, the trend towards free agency is only going to accelerate in the coming years, raising a critical question for fulltime employers: How to retain and motivate traditional fulltime employees when 40% of the workforce has total freedom? To successfully address this challenge, organizations must understand and practice these five people management hacks.

Imagine working for a company that does not monitor your office hours or your work - you are free to decide when and how much you want to work; and take as much vacation as you need. No, I am not fantasizing. This is exactly what a lot of companies are already doing. Why? Because they’ve understood the first hack – setting employees free increases productivity rather than the other way around.

That performance in any group distributes itself on a 20:60:20 curve is a well-established fact. About 20% of workers in any group are exceptional performers, 60% are average, and 20% are low performers. Thanks to Vilfredo Pareto, we’ve also known since 1906 that 20% of the people produce 80% of results. Forcing all 100% of them to set stretch goals and hoping that they will all achieve exceptional results is an exercise in futility. If employees can choose when and how much they want to work with the explicit understanding that their rewards (and consequences) will be commensurate with their choice, they will be much happier, and the organization will be able to pay them appropriately. Organizational productivity will not suffer for two reasons: One, the top 20% will anyway produce 80% of the results, and Two, the remaining 80% will be freed to work without the stigma or pressure of non-performance and contribute with higher engagement. Whether we like it or not, the 20:60:20 distribution is a given. Why not legitimize it, and manage staff costs accordingly? It’s a win-win for all.

“Why is A paid so much higher than B, C and D,” asked an employee in a townhall meeting. “This is unfair favoritism,” he added. Here’s how the CEO responded: “A is paid more because of the quality and quantity of his results. If you want to be a favorite, join the club and we’ll pay you as much too. A’s goals and results are not a secret, neither are yours. It is that simple and transparent.”

In line with hack #1, in today’s open source transparent era, it is perfectly okay to pay/reward people disproportionately based on the empowered choices they make. Performance expectations must be made clear – this is what you need to do if you want to be in the top 20%. If you choose to operate as part of the 60% or the bottom 20%, that’s ok, but remember, your pay and rewards will vary accordingly. It is entirely up to you- you decide.

Contrary to conventional practice, we strongly recommend making salary information public. In times when even the Pentagon or the U.S. elections can be hacked, what are the chances that you can keep information secret anyway? Why not make it open, and crystal clear what it takes to make minimum, average and maximum rewards?

Question: How do companies decide how much to pay for a particular job?

Answer: Refer to benchmark survey data of how other companies pay for similar jobs.

Sounds familiar? Does it really make sense? Absolutely not! Why? Because no two jobs are the same. Furthermore, benchmarking to market sounds fair, but it does not consider that a good employee becomes more and more valuable and dependable over the years, even if he is doing the same job. If market data is the only benchmark, once the employee hits the top of his salary range, you cannot pay him more unless you promote him. In this situation, either a highly dependable employee leaves, or the Peter Principle kicks in – where members of a hierarchy are promoted until they reach the level at which they are no longer competent.

Instead of salary surveys, judgment should be used to determine pay and rewards. The only questions that matter are these: How valuable is this employee to us, and What would happen if she were to leave us?

4. Trust them to do the right thing

When Netflix replaced their detailed travel expense policy with one sentence – Act in Netflix’ best interest – many warned that employees will behave irresponsibly; and overall travel & entertainment expenses will skyrocket. But no such thing happened. Employees responded to the trust with responsible action. They acted like owners.

Research points to the fact that when you give people trust and freedom, a vast majority of them reciprocate with responsible and ethical behavior. In today’s age of breakneck speed, rules and policies get outdated before the ink dries on them. The days of using power and authority to drive desired behavior are over. Organizations have no choice but to shun excessive rules and build a culture of trust and freedom wherein employees are recognized and rewarded for living the values rather than following rules.

Conventional management practice says a company must continually invest to enhance their employees’ leadership competence to maximize productivity and overall performance. Yet, the billions spent each year on leadership development yield little to no results. Why? Because most leadership training focuses on the ‘how’ rather than the ‘why.’ The most productive employees are not the ones that are trained and/or paid the most. Those that see a larger sense of purpose in their work are the most dedicated ones. Their reward lies in knowing that their efforts are creating a better future, not just earning a salary and bonus.

To maximize the motivation and performance of an individual, a manager must help her develop deep clarity of personal values and purpose; and align the resultant (leadership) energy to the work at hand.

These people management hacks may seem counter-intuitive at first, but many companies around the world are realizing their significance in today’s open source world and have implemented them successfully. The trick is in taking baby steps, learning from them, and continually tweaking your culture until you get it right.",wellness
"My studies of truly innovative organizations have revealed five common elements (regardless of industry) that define cultures that excel at innovation. They are Empowerment, Honesty, Community, Goals, and Leadership. Here’s a look at these elements individually.

When the late Steve Jobs said, “It doesn’t make sense to hire smart people and tell them what to do; we hire smart people so they can tell us what to do,” he was talking about empowerment. Apple is an historic leader in innovation because they hire the best and they coach their people to believe in their abilities and encourage them towards autonomous decision making and idea realization.

Sadly, while many organizations claim a similar desire and support for innovation, far too many leaders kill creative thinking by failing to empower their people. In one of my studies, only a third of employees say they are encouraged to think independently. And in another study, only 42% of employees say they “Always” or “Frequently” learn on the job, while 39% say they “Never” or “Rarely” learn on the job.

It’s a leader’s job to motivate people to go places they wouldn’t otherwise go—but when you tell employees where to go, and how to get there, it squashes their desire to come up with great new ideas. Empowering people doesn’t mean letting employees do whatever they want. Formalize empowerment by setting boundaries that give people room to be creative while keeping them in alignment with the organization. Giving employees permission to learn, whether it’s seeking outside learning, experience sharing or allowing them to recover from and learn from their mistakes (instead of fixing mistakes for them) is a great place to start.

Oftentimes an organization will hit the ground running with an exciting new innovative idea, but somewhere along the way it becomes clear that it’s not going to work. Seemingly great ideas often fail, that’s not the problem. The issue is when failed projects are allowed to linger. No one speaks up and says “this project is dead” usually because someone in a place of political power orchestrated the project, or there’s a high level of emotional connection to the work that’s already been done. Consequently, vast amounts of valuable resources are squandered and great new ideas that potentially may work never get launched.  In fact, in the study ""The Risks Of Ignoring Employee Feedback,"" only 6% of people say that at their organization, good suggestions or valid complaints from employees Always lead to important changes.

A critical element found in innovative cultures is the willingness to call these “zombie projects” for what they are. Google is one company that knows how to say, “This thing is not going to work. Let’s kill it off and free up our creative energy to do something different.” Don’t be afraid to speak the truth and send zombie projects to the graveyard where they belong.

The third secret of innovation is fostering a sense community so people feel like they’re all in it together. Community efforts encourage brainstorming, help to move ideas forward and contribute to making necessary course corrections when roadblocks occur. Innovation often involves change, a painful prospect for a lot of people. These tensions are greatly eased when everyone is working together towards a common goal.

As you use community to influence innovation, consider more than just the obvious internal community. Nearly every organization has suppliers, vendors and even customers who have some great ideas. One example is Toyota who made their customers a part of their community by running ads asking for customer ideas on how to leverage Toyota technologies. This notion is called Contestification, which basically means creating contests for customers to generate the best ideas. The more you bring people together, the greater your community will become and the more innovation you’ll get.

The rule here is easy: if you want big innovation, set big and difficult goals that push people outside their comfort zone.

My study called “Aree SMART Goals Dumb?” determined that goals that are achievable and realistic (two elements of SMART goals) don’t push people to achieve great things. Of the 4,000 people studied who were setting SMART goals, only 13% said they were going to reach their full potential with this goal and only 15% said they were going to achieve greatness.

Difficult goals lead to extraordinary performance. Innovative giants like Apple and Google push their employees every day to step outside of their comfort zone by using difficult goals that force their people to think and act in innovative new ways. Take this quiz to evaluate whether the goals you set for yourself and your employees have all the elements of a HARD Goal, including hitting that sweet spot of difficulty that pushes people to achieve innovative greatness.

The four elements covered above are necessary for innovation, but you also need great leaders who are passionate about empowering people, speaking the truth, creating community and setting HARD Goals.

Innovation is rarely structured, it can happen in all manners of ways, and there’s often a scarcity of supporting data neatly laid out that points to the right direction to take. Equip leaders with the tools they need to make decisions in ambiguous situations. Encourage them to find creative ways to structure experiments or to make statistical leaps and judgments based on available data and give them permission to pilot ideas, experiment, test, and even to fail. You can take this leadership styles quiz to help determine whether your leadership style is hindering or helping innovation.

With the five elements of Empowerment, Honesty, Community, Goals and Leadership in place, your people will start to generate the innovative growth that you desire, and you’ll be able to solve many more of your customer’s fundamental issues. And as innovation grows, so too will your organizational success.",wellness
"There are many elements associated with high levels of productivity. Ask any given person how to be productive and you're most likely going to be inundated with a plethora of suggestions. But at its core, productivity comes down to your energy and flow state (or being ""in the zone,"" as some call it).

Without those two elements, it's impossible to be your most productive self. Getting those two elements firing on all cylinders doesn't need to be complicated. In fact, implementing these five tiny tweaks to your daily routine will set you on the right path.

1. Start and end your day like Benjamin Franklin.

The daily and meticulous routine of this historical figure has been well-documented. While his daily schedule is the most popular thing that people share from his autobiography, the biggest benefit to my productivity has come from implementing his two daily questions.

If you're anything like me, you probably have an ambitious and aggressive daily to-do list that can sometimes become bloated with actions that aren't moving the needle forward. Asking these two questions will help you remove what's unnecessary from your day and overall work life.

2. Go to sleep and wake up at the same times.

In an effort to get more done, many entrepreneurs are tempted to cut sleep. This approach is counterproductive. While you're sleeping, not only are you recovering from your daily activities but you're also consolidating your memories and new information into long-term knowledge.

As humans, we're creatures of habit, and finding a consistent sleep rhythm is pivotal. The habit that delivers the largest ROI to improving your sleep and energy, according to a Fitbit study in March 2017, is to consistently go to sleep around the same time.

One to two hours daily of lost sleep quietly wreaks havoc on your productivity and energy. Pick a consistent sleep time and wake-up time that also allow you enough time in the morning to slowly ease into the day.

Your car isn't going to make it far without fuel, and you're not going to perform at a high level without quality nutrients in your body. It's not just food. It's water, also.

In fact, being dehydrated by as little as 1 percent can lead to a decrease in positive mood and cognitive abilities, according to a study published in The Journal of Nutrition in February 2012.

Before reaching for your morning espresso, properly rehydrate by drinking 20 to 32 ounces of water. To save time, I have a morning smoothie that has my water and fruits and vegetables all thrown in together.

4. Schedule and name your work sessions.

If you think about it, we're playing numerous roles and characters in our day-to-day life. Why not bring that spirit to our work? Instead of thinking that you have to write each morning, create an avatar and specific mission for your writing.

5. Take breaks to reenergize yourself.

This can look different to each of us. However, what's most important is to separate yourself from your work and de-stress. This time is ideal for a walk in nature, eating some healthy food, making a green juice, finding funny materials to get some laughs in, or listening to an audiobook to stay inspired.",None
"As the Republican leadership celebrates yesterday’s seating of Judge Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court and the prospect of “a rock-solid Republican majority for a generation,” the Supreme Court itself faces the prospect of a generation of ethical questions.

Already, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. has received more than a dozen judicial misconduct complaints against Judge Kavanaugh.

These complaints were initially received by the U.S. Court of Appeals. Chief Judge Merrick Garland — whose nomination to the Supreme Court by President Barack Obama was blocked by Senate Republicans — recused himself from the matter. The complaints were then passed to Judge Karen LeCraft Henderson, whom President George H.W. Bush nominated to the bench.

The Chief Judge of a circuit court normally reviews complaints against judges in his or her circuit. Most are dismissed because they lack a factual basis to make such a claim or are simply disagreeing with a judge’s decision.

In this instance, Judge Henderson dismissed some complaints against Judge Kavanaugh as frivolous but concluded that other complaints were substantive enough to warrant investigation and that they should not be handled by Judge Kavanaugh’s fellow judges in the D.C. Circuit. In a statement Saturday, Judge Henderson said the complaints centered on statements that Kavanaugh made during his Senate confirmation hearings.

Under the law, “any person may file a misconduct complaint in the circuit in which the federal judge sits,” Judge Henderson said in the statement. “The complaints seek investigations only of the public statements he has made as a nominee to the Supreme Court of the United States.”

According to the Washington Post, most of the complaints center on Kavanaugh’s answers about his work in the Bush administration and his lack of judicial temperament in his partisan comments about Democrats.

The complaints are not isolated:

Chief Justice Roberts has chosen for the time being not to refer them to a judicial panel for investigation. According to the Washington Post, “Roberts did not see an urgent need for them to be resolved by the judicial branch while he continued to review the incoming complaints.”

The situation is unusual from a number of angles:

Although there is nothing normal about the current situation, the standard process when ethical issues are raised about a sitting judge is to refer the matter to an independent panel of judges. If Chief Justice Roberts does not recuse himself and attempts to dismiss the ethics questions without review by an independent panel of judges, ethical complaints about his own conduct may be raised.

Technically, Supreme Court justices are not subject to the misconduct rules governing these claims. But if complaints against sitting Justices are in turn suppressed, then there will be an asterisk against Chief Justice Roberts and the Court for the remainder of their terms.

“If Justice Roberts sits on the complaints, then they will reside in a kind of purgatory and will never be adjudicated,” said Stephen Gillers, a professor at New York University Law School and an expert on Supreme Court ethics. But the issues won't just disappear: Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Kavanaugh may find themselves residing in the same purgatory unless and until the complaints are definitively dealt with.

As a result, Chief Justice Roberts may see the political expedience and legitimate interests of the Supreme Court itself in having with the ethical questions that have been raised against Judge Kavnaaugh dealt with in the standard manner with a panel of independent judges from the Federal bench.

Even if the ethical questions are dealt with by a credible panel of independent judges, the questions won’t end there.

The victory of the “rock-solid Republican majority for a generation” may thus turn out to be something of a Pyrrhic victory.

"When it comes to evaluating success for salespeople, it's often focused on one thing: the win. Asking for the customer's business and getting a quick and enthusiastic ""yes!"" seems, at times, to be the only thing that counts.

This mindset, and the aggressive behavior that it drives, comes at a cost. According to HubSpot research, only 17 percent of salespeople consider themselves ""pushy"" compared to 50 percent of prospects who see them that way.

If you want to be a more effective sales leader, getting the sale right away might win you the commission but lose you the relationship, your credibility and even referral potential.

In other words, if you are completely and deeply committed to a situation turning out one specific way--and that one way only--you have a lot invested in a single result.  What does this mean for salespeople? It means that making the sale right now is one good outcome of a sales conversation. But if it is the primary way you're measuring success, you're going to experience a lot of failure, setbacks and rejection.

Salesman and motivational speaker Zig Ziglar remarked, ""Every sale has five obstacles: no need, no money, no hurry, no desire, no trust."" If your prospect gives you some clues to help you better understand and strategize a way around those roadblocks, you'll be better prepared to make a more effective sale down the road.

Ask your prospect questions like, ""Who are some of your favorite service providers or vendors to work with and why?"". Or offer ""It sounds like you don't need us right now. What would need to change on your end for our product to be useful for you?"" You might even empathize, ""Seems like budgets are tight right now. What's that like for you?"" And then really listen. You'll get some useful nuggets to save for the right time. That's a win.

Maybe your prospect isn't the decision-maker, but wants to connect you to the person who is. You might say, ""I'm so glad I had this opportunity to sit down with you to learn more about your business and your decision-making process. It seems like the person I should be speaking with next is Jamie. Is that right?""

Or perhaps your prospect isn't in the market for your product or service right now, but knows someone who may be. Try, ""I appreciate your candor. Thanks for letting me know that our service isn't what you're looking for right now. I'm wondering, based on what you've heard about us, whom you know who might be in the market for this."" And then stop talking.

Whether it's making the right connection within the organization or obtaining a new, qualified lead, both are wins.  And when the lead comes with a personal introduction (which you'll offer to draft), you're already ahead of the game.

The worst outcome of a sales meeting isn't hearing ""no."" It's hearing ""no, and don't call me again."" Even if your prospect isn't going to buy what you're offering now, he or she may buy what you're offering down the road. Say, ""Let's stay in touch. You never know when things might change on your end, or when we have something new to offer. How about if I reach back out in 6-8 weeks. Does that timing work for you?"" I usually get a ""yes"" -- and then I put the reminder in my calendar ASAP.

Sometimes I hear, ""I think I'll have a better sense of things in six months. Will you reach out then?""(Even better). And what if you hear, ""Thank you, but we're already working with a firm we love and trust""? I might say, ""I'm so glad you've found a great partner you can rely on. That makes our whole industry look good!"" And then, I send occasional articles and emails to stay top of mind because things can change! The prospect's demonstrated interest in being in touch with you again is a reasonable indicator that he or she may buy it from you when the time is right.",
"At the beginning of each school year, I would receive a massive stack of folders on my desk. The folders came with yellow, white and pink papers or better known as student records.

Every fall, I was expected to read former teachers' notes, recommendations, and test scores for all of my incoming students. However, along with these records came labels.

The teachers before me labeled my students. There was nothing unusual about this fact, as it was part of our teaching routine. The teachers didn’t do anything out of the ordinary.

My new students were trailing with various notes home, phone calls to parents, disciplinary actions, grades, and learning needs.

However, that's when I realized that these were their former relationships, not mine.

My first year teaching was overwhelming. I was told to read through all of the student records carefully to assure I knew each student well, what to expect, and how to best meet all learning needs.

I read each document carefully. I envisioned each student before they ever walked through my classroom door.

As a young teacher, I followed the rules. I envisioned every student before I met him or her. And, I was wrong.

I set up my classroom through the eyes of four former teachers, and not with my own eyes. Teaching from another educator's point of view did not lead to a successful school year.

I knew I would have to use my lens and recognize the unique perspective and background each student brought into my classroom-this was key to becoming a better teacher.

I chose to re-evaluate my strategy the following school year.

My second year, I skimmed through the stack folders checking for concerning conditions (health or mental concerns) only. I didn't read through previous teacher comments. I didn't look at grades, test scores or phone calls home.

I wanted to meet my students for what they brought, and for who they would become in my classroom, including what they would teach me.

On the first day of class in my second year teaching, not one student walked into my classroom with a label. I learned about my students from the relationships I built with them. I had conversations with them, noticed their strengths, and learned about their background knowledge. After that, I honed in on their skills, and provided guidance so they could shine through their talents.

I was no longer unjustly biased, and it was the best gift I could have ever given to my students. That school year, my students taught me a lot about life, as they did every year that followed.

You may wonder, what does this story have to do with entrepreneurship?

Entrepreneurs can apply the same strategies as effective teachers. These practices can lead to a stronger work culture, thriving relationships, and a better chance to meet financial goals. Teaching and working at startups have taught me about business. Now I can see how entrepreneurs and leading teachers can similarly run their classrooms or boardrooms.

The most effective teachers are the ones who guide their students, provide growth opportunities, instill creativity, make room for curiosity, leave labels behind, and teach with compassion. In the workplace, these strategies can run parallel to entrepreneurs who want to better their leadership skills.

And, when you're an entrepreneur, self-reflection, compassion, perspective, checking for understanding, and practicing gratitude can have a substantial effect on your business and relationships.

Self-Reflection: Know your background and who you are as a person in the world. Understanding yourself, where you came from, and where you want to go can have a critical impact on your work and business relationships. Also, knowing yourself well provides the opportunity to create a strong company culture, one that is warm and welcoming.

Self-reflection can also allow for greater awareness of concerning performance and provides an opportunity to seek out solutions. When you develop a performance plan for an employee, you can also create one for yourself. This strategy can help with both personal and career growth, and increase your leadership capacity.

Also, keeping track of the areas in your business that worked and note those that failed. Reflect on those events, and pivot when necessary.

Compassion: When you work in any environment, pay attention to the perspectives of others. Keep in mind that they too are looking at everyone and everything through a different lens. Lead with compassion.

Wharton conducted a study regarding compassion in the workplace. They found the power of a compassionate workplace had profound effects on happiness, motivation, productivity, and the bottom line.

Glassdoor named Jeff Weiner, CEO of LinkedIn, one of the top 10 most-liked leaders in 2018. With a 97% approval rating, Weiner leads his team with compassion. You can get an idea regarding some of his strategies in the video below.

Perspective: Perspective is one of the most critical aspects to finding success not only in the classroom, but also in the boardroom. To succeed in any leadership role, it is beneficial to learn about the perspectives within your workplace culture. Employees come to work with different ideas, motivation, life backgrounds, and expectations surrounding their work. When you can understand how people feel, you can interact most effectively.

Understanding and applying perspective consciously every day can be a challenging task. Start in small increments. Make note of the situations that worked, and the ones that didn't work.

For example, working with a new team can bring different concerns. Your employees all come in at different levels with various visions based on their background.

And, you do, too.

Check for Understanding: Having a meeting? Although many of us think we speak the same language, it is imperative to check for understanding--especially after a meeting. Have you ever sat in a conference after the speaker left and listened to the comments? Who got the message? Who didn't? Was it clear? Did you speak up if you didn't understand? As business leaders, it is essential to check for understanding.

Gratitude: Leaders should make note and appreciate the unique talents everyone brings to the table. Let your employees grow on their own, listen to them, and make sure they know their voices are heard.

Our diversity in skill, knowledge and life experience can all make for a better work environment.

No matter whom you work with, when you go in with a deep understanding of yourself and a conscious recognition that we all see things differently, you can begin to create a thriving working environment.

Let's leave the old folders closed and let the genuine, talented, relationships begin.",coaching
"Change is inevitable, especially in today’s ever-evolving workplace. From physical to cultural to technological shifts, the workplace is a mecca for change. While change can be unique (and specific) to an organization, a strategic process can help leaders prepare, equip and mobilize individuals and teams to embrace transition — it’s called change management, a methodology for influencing people to support a common goal. If there’s one thing to remember about change management, it’s this: Organizations don’t change, people do.

In the past decade, technology, people and physical spaces have converged in ways that have dramatically changed office design. With a renewed focus on workforce optimization, the workplace has transformed from a destination where work gets done to a stimulating space for how work should get done. And companies are taking note. Traditional office spaces that were once designed for status are now evolving to become workplace environments that enhance functionality and employee performance.

For some organizations, this means better utilizing their overall square footage in ways that optimize employee productivity and support their specific tasks and needs. For example, managers converting their private offices into mixed-use areas with desks and more space for teamwork and collaboration. Micro-offices, bullpens, office neighborhoods designed for specific departments or functional teams and spaces outfitted with modern technology are becoming more prevalent in workplaces today and enable employees to switch efficiently from independent work to team activities.

While these office design concepts enhance the employee experience, they aren’t always intuitive. In some cases, they go against cultural norms. And any change that feels like a loss to employees can be tricky to navigate.

Here are four ways to leverage change management techniques in ways that empower people to embrace change:

1. Believe in the change. Whether a change effort is driven by necessity or enthusiasm for innovation, support must be genuine. If it’s not, rethink the purpose of the change, your role in it or both. Be prepared to live the change and lead by example.

2. Acknowledge that change is emotional. “What’s in it for me?” is a key question every person wants answered. For managers, this may be a contentious subject — after all, we’re all adults and are here to do our jobs. But the reality is that it only takes a few detractors to derail a change effort, and change that feels imposed often leads to resistance and fear, even if there’s plenty of data to support it. Change is emotional. Influencing people to adopt change can be supported, but not driven, by data. Rather, take the data and make it emotional. Consider that when people actively want the change to happen, management is more about controlling the speed of the roll-out rather than encouraging people to quickly adapt.

3. Identify your supporters and manage resistors. Individuals who support the change initiative should include leadership and respected staff who are vocal about improvements. Identify your biggest resistors early on and make them a part of the change-management team. Don’t forget to have open and honest conversations with employees to identify any reservations. This feedback may or may not alter the effort, but it will make your plan and approach stronger by enlisting everyone to carry some responsibility for success.

4. Engage a professional. While project managers serve to meet an organization’s project goals and business objectives, their role is focused on the technical aspects of planning and execution. They shouldn’t get confused with change managers — professionals who focus on behavior, group dynamics and communication. There are synergies between project management and change management and the two should work in tandem, but they are different disciplines. With this said, enlisting a change manager on your team to help lead the process of adoption and buy-in can help mitigate resistance and be an advocate for your change effort.

As workplaces become increasingly dynamic, companies will need to evolve their office design to meet the needs of their staff and business objectives. To ensure a successful transformation with change management techniques, gain acceptance by activating and engaging employees in the change. While change management may seem daunting, when applied effectively, it can serve as a strategic tool for business success and enhance a company’s bottom line.",
"This year's Nobel Prize in Chemistry is given to three scientists, one half of the prize is given to Frances Arnold and the other half is shared jointly with George Smith and Gregory Winter. The scientists were honored for their work in harnessing principles in evolutionary biology to design various molecules from catalysts to antibodies. The Nobel committee states that this years prize is specifically motivated by using principles in nature to create novel chemical molecules, ""the 2018 Nobel Laureates in Chemistry have taken control of evolution and used it for purposes that bring the greatest benefit to humankind.""

Dr Frances Arnold is only the fifth woman to win the prize in its 117-year history. She serves as an inspiration for all the young women who are seeking to pursue the fields of STEM. Her work heralds the use of evolutionary principles in biology, applying them to the design of enzymes, or catalysts. In chemistry catalysts are molecules that speed up the rate of the reaction, by decreasing the activation energy, or the energy needed to start the reaction. They are used in a variety of process where chemical reactions occur, anything from manufacturing, to pharmaceuticals, to renewable energy. Dr. Arnold  developed methods to refine the way catalysts are produced. One of the methods she developed was  to remove heavy metal catalysts from drug manufacturing processes, insuring less environmental damage and greater health safety. Often when heavy metals are used in the catalysis of process for the manufacture of drugs, toxic waste is created, so her work ensured greater safety for the environment and human kind. Dr. Frances Arnold received her PhD from  University of California, Berkeley and she is now a professor of chemical engineering, bioengineering and biochemistry at the California Institute of Technology.  The other half of the prize was shared for the work of developing a method as phage display and using it to create new anti-bodies. George Smith developed the phage display method. This method uses foreign DNA that is introduced to code for a protein, that protein then displayed on the surface of the phage. In that way the protein that is displayed on the phage can then be used to screen for various interactions with other proteins, DNA sequences, and other small molecules. The phage display method was then used by Gregory Winter to design novel antibodies. In 2002, adalimumab (Humira), an antibody developed using this technique was approved in Europe and the US  for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. The technique has been further used to develop antibodies against autoimmune diseases, as well as late stage metastatic cancers. Dr George Smith received his PhD from Harvard University and is a Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Biological Sciences, at the University of Missouri. Sir Gregory Winter received his PhD from Cambridge University and is a Research Leader Emeritus, MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK.

The choice of the Noble Prize this year with the emphasis on the groundbreaking work stemming from using the principles of nature and the scientists who pioneered these principles, both give us an inspiration for the continued creativity in search of other breakthroughs in the fields of science.",
"Corporations are placing increasing value on cross-cultural diversity, and many provide education to help employees understand different cultural norms that can impede collaboration, along with ways to work around those differences.

I’d like to explore a more universal barrier that can arise in cross-cultural one-on-one relationships and how we can move past it.

When we interact with colleagues, bosses or subordinates from a different culture, I’ve noticed that, aside from varying cultural norms, we may unwittingly assume some level of disconnection.

Even if no specific cultural variances are in play, we often don’t feel as “at home” with that person as we do with someone from our own culture.

We may be more careful and less openly communicative, simply because we don’t think we “know” the other person that well. Sometimes this becomes a business issue by impacting trust.

The Interplay Of Two Kinds Of Trust

• There are two kinds of trust in business relationships: affective and cognitive.

• Although all cultures experience both kinds of trust, different cultures will favor one kind of trust over the other.

In the U.S. and most of Europe, for example, businesspeople usually rely on cognitive trust, which is earned by showing the other person that you know what you’re doing and are dependable.

A number of other business cultures tend to favor affective or relational trust, which develops through knowing and bonding with the other person.

But there’s a degree of relational trust involved even in cultures where trust is predominantly cognitive. For example: If you want to think that a person is good at his or her job, you’re more likely to conclude they are good at it and view it as an exception when they make a mistake. When affective trust is absent, however, you’re less inclined to recognize their achievements or cut them slack for mistakes.

This is borne out by a 2013 University of Pennsylvania study, which found that evaluations of an IT team’s performance were more favorable when the evaluators’ level of affective trust in individual IT project managers was greater.

Likewise, in cultures where trust is predominantly relational, there is also a degree of cognitive trust.

Whenever cross-cultural disconnections impact performance, the solution usually lies not in addressing cultural differences, but in pulling back and working to develop trust. In fact, understanding how to develop trust is useful across a broad spectrum of business relationships.

Whether you need to cultivate affective trust, cognitive trust or both, it’s best done through live one-on-one interactions, not through emails.

Which kind of trust is more important? It depends not only on the culture of the person you’re working with but what they’re like as an individual.

For example, when individuals are less relationship-oriented and prefer sticking with concrete matters, you’ll need to cultivate cognitive trust, which involves more than showing that you “know your stuff."" It requires demonstrating that you have no other agenda than accurately assessing the situation and coming up with a workable solution.

While this differs from affective trust, it’s cultivated not only by the quality of the suggestions, questions and observations you come up with but the attitude you reflect when communicating with the person. The person has to recognize your seriousness and your desire to be partners in the pursuit of truth.

There are no tricks or formulas involved here. You have to be earnest, and then it shows. If thorny political or relational factors with third parties bear on the issues you’re discussing, you need to acknowledge them, whether you’re at liberty to describe them fully or only partially.

When interacting with this type of individual, if you tried to cultivate affective trust, it could come over as manipulative.

With individuals who are more relational, bridging the gap may involve both cognitive and affective trust or primarily affective trust.

And, no, developing affective trust doesn’t mean you just swap stories about family and hobbies, though in fact, this may help because affective trust is founded on getting to know each other.

Rather, it involves taking a degree of risk, being willing to express something about the nature of your interaction with the other person, your work situation, other colleagues, your own limitations or your personal concerns.

It could be something like:

“Ï’m wondering if we’re fully understanding each other. Do you think so?”

“I have a really hard time with Harry.”

“Do you think I talk too much in meetings? I thought I went on and on this morning.”

The way to cultivate relational trust, then, is by trusting — that is, trusting that the other person won’t respond negatively if you choose to be open and unguarded.

Cross-cultural sensitivity comes into play here too, along with sensitivity to the person as an individual. For example, is their culture uncomfortable with directness? Are they personally uncomfortable with directness?

There’s no formula here either. Someone has to put a toe in the water and see what happens. And if you’re the boss (or the mentor, colleague, or team leader), it will be up to you.

As a coach, I’ve learned to trust that my openness will be positively responded to. Most people are looking for the opportunity to trust others.

But yes, sometimes it falls flat. That’s why it’s a risk. And even if this risk doesn’t pay off initially, it doesn’t mean that affective trust can’t be developed later.

Overall, if you exercise some sensitivity, it’s definitely worth it.

Finally, cross-cultural relationships require patience. Even when members of different cultures develop a high degree of trust, it may take time before their relationships are as comfortable as the relationship the other person has with people from their own culture.

The good news is that, the more we strive for trust, the more potential there is for extraordinary relationships both inside and outside of global businesses.",
"Maybe you've heard about the massive new aviation law that Congress passed at 2:52 a.m. on a Saturday, and that President Trump signed last week, literally in the middle of a key senator's speech about the Supreme Court nomination.

I sure did--at least, I heard from the largest union representing more than 50,000 flight attendants at United Airlines, Spirit, Frontier, and Hawaiian, among others.

They're very glad that the bill became law. But they also seem surprised about part of what was included in it, and frankly at the whole context.

Quick background: The 2018 FAA Reauthorization bill was in the works for years. In fact, Congress had to pass the 1,200-page bill even just to keep the Federal Aviation Administration authorized and in business.

It covers a lot of stuff--from the minimum spacing between seats on commercial airlines, to $1.68 billion for hurricane relief, to a provision authorizing the government to shoot down privately owned drones.

But there are also some new rules about sexual harassment and sexual assault on commercial airlines, and that's what prompted a reaction from the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA.

They've been working on these issues for years, and they've also proven what a lot of people probably already thought they knew:

Namely that flight attendants face a lot of sexual harassment and even flat-out assault on the job, and that many passengers do as well. A few of their surveys show that--

Most important in the new law from the union's perspective, its president Sara Nelson told me this week, is the creation of a National In-Flight Sexual Misconduct Task Force to study sexual harassment and misconduct on airplanes.

Sure. Because while sexual assault is a crime, obviously, victims are loathe to report it--and especially reticent to do so on a plane, where there might be few witnesses, lots of embarrassment or shock, and where they're not at all convinced that reporting it will lead to any kind of result, anyway.

So, you need to study the whole thing first, Nelson told me, ""fully reviewing the problem and understanding it, and getting all the experts in the room to put together best practices,"" before ""creating legislation and training, and proscribing answers.""

If all goes according to plan, the task force is supposed to lead to new regulations in 18 months. But in the meantime, the new law does have some teeth.

For one thing, it establishes a civil penalty for sexually assaulting flight crew, cabin crew, or anyone else on a plane (tough to believe that wasn't specifically covered before!). And, it increases the current civil penalty for interference with flight crew from $25,000 to $35,000.

Those parts are a little more surprising to the flight attendants, since they came into the bill toward the end of the process--without a lot of Congressional hearings and negotiations.

In fact, it's the speed with which things started to happen, after years of very slow progress, that Nelson said is most stunning:

To put some perspective on it, our union was essentially formed to beat back the discrimination against women on the job. We had to quit when we were 32. You couldn't weigh more than 125 pounds. All kinds of discriminatory practices. You had to be a woman! ... When the #MeToo movement broke, it was almost jarring, to suddenly be able to say, ""Yeah, this is unacceptable. We don't accept this either. And it gets in the way of us doing our jobs."" Because there just wasn't a platform to do that before. And that's why we're so excited about this moment.",
"We know by now that fewer women than men are starting companies, this holds true in developing nations as well as in Silicon Valley. On top of that fact, new research sheds light on a side of women’s entrepreneurship that is not yet fully understood: Companies that women start, own, and run are less likely to trade internationally than those owned by men. But there is case for optimism – this issue is currently receiving high-level policy attention, which may spur further actions to close the gap.

While female entrepreneurship has been discussed widely, this particular focus on international trade is relatively new. An International Trade Centre survey in 20 developing countries found that just 20% of exporting private companies are owned by women. My calculations based on a World Bank data set suggest that, by contrast, in these 20 countries, on average 36% of private companies which do not export are owned by women.

Gender and trade was one of the core issues discussed at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) Public Forum held in Geneva this week, gathering over 1,500 participants from across the world. The WTO’s Director General Roberto Azevêdo addressed diplomats and business leaders on the role of women in global value chains. His speech explores a range of barriers for female entrepreneurs in global value chains, including access to finance and information.

Barriers for internationally-minded female entrepreneurs were also clearly identified in a report published by the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC). This report found that there are four constraints for women-owned Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in exporting:

Even though the above barriers apply to female entrepreneurs more generally, they are more pronounced for those who export. Exporting companies require more capital, more specialist skills and a wider network. Entrepreneurs at the helm of such companies also tend to travel for work, which may be difficult to balance with care responsibilities.

To address these barriers, there have been initiatives such as WeConnect International, a global network that connects women-owned businesses to qualified buyers around the world founded in 2009; the APEC Women Connect programme, an online community for female entrepreneurs launched last year; and the high-profile Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative to provide over $1 billion financing to women entrepreneurs in developing countries.

While the gender gap in trade is still pervasive, there is a case for optimism. The gender focus this week at the WTO Public Forum shows that policy attention in this area is increasing. Ten months ago, 118 WTO members and observers signed up to the Buenos Aires Declaration on Trade and Women’s Economic Empowerment. The Declaration marked the first time in the 23-year history of the WTO that members and observers endorsed a collective initiative to increase the participation of women in trade. In March 2017, Chile and Canada included a dedicated Trade and Gender chapter in their bilateral free trade agreement. Policy makers are increasingly interested and committed to drive this agenda forward.

If the ambitious rhetoric is matched by equally ambitious actions, we may soon see more female entrepreneurs – maybe even as many as their male counterparts – trading internationally.

"It's been a rough time lately for bad passenger behavior. And if other stories recently haven't prompted rank and file airline passengers to demand that something more effective be done, perhaps this story will spur action.

Early Saturday morning, an American passenger aboard a KLM flight from Abu Dhabi to Amsterdam reportedly ""started screaming and hitting wildly around him,"" according to a member of the cabin crew, to the point that the Royal Netherlands Air Force sent a pair of F-16 fighter jets armed with air-to-air missiles to intercept the plane.

The story first broke in the Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf over the weekend, and it's been separately reported by AFP as well.

Cabin crew said the overnight flight wasn't crowded, and that the American passenger did not appear to be intoxicated, but that he first attracted attention when he began walking around the cabin while most other passenger were asleep.

Flight attendants asked him to sit down, but he became ""aggressive"" and reacted ""very threateningly from one moment to the next,"" a flight attendant said.

Punches were apparently thrown, and several other passengers were ""lightly wounded"" during the fracas, according to Dutch authorities, including two who ""were given black eyes.""

""A 29-year-old American man became aggressive after being asked by a purser to return to his seat,"" Joanna Helmonds, a police spokesperson, said afterward. ""A scuffle broke out and the cabin crew, together with other passengers managed to restrain the man.""

The Dutch police didn't name the passenger, and said he ""came across as disoriented,"" and was being held in a Dutch psychiatric institution for observation.

Of course, there's a happy ending to the story in that the plane landed safely in Amsterdam--on time, no less.

Still, it's easy to imagine how a simple miscommunication or human error could have led to a much more tragic situation. And it comes after we've reported story after story about disruptive passengers on domestic flights who allegedly got drunk, became aggressive, and caused their flights to be diverted:

So what's the solution? Obviously, problem drinking is a big part of many of these situations. And the new FAA law that President Trump just signed does contain tougher penalties for interfering with flight crew on U.S. flights.

But flight attendants are in a tough position: they're first line safety officers, but they're also there for passenger comfort. Yes, they serve drinks on most flights, but it's asking a lot for them also to act as bouncers, or cops.

Personally, I'm old enough to remember what flying was like for a year or two after the September 11, 2001 terror attacks--when, at least in my personal experience, passengers were more likely to keep an eye on each other, and when it seemed like peer pressure likely stopped some people from acting aggressively on airplanes.

Regardless, at 40,000 feet, we're all in this together. And if I were one of the innocent souls aboard an aircraft where a violent fellow passenger caused enough of a disturbance to result in armed fighter jets intercepting me, I don't think I'd be taking this lightly.

"Ever feel completely drained after a flight, long car ride, or just a day of sitting at a desk? Even though you were just sitting for a long time, you felt exhausted. There are so many negative side effects to simply sitting for extended periods of time. Yet, Americans sit for on average 8 hours a day, with most of these hours being at work. Sitting for such a long time can negatively affect your health , side effects include:

Sitting for long periods of time can cause more harm than good, especially for office workers. In an attempt to avoid these side effects, standing desks have become more and more popular. Not only do they avoid these harmful consequences of sitting, but standing desks actually improve health. Studies have shown standing desks actually increase productivity and focus in the workplace. An article by the Washington Post cited a recent study conducted by Texas A&M University's Health Science Center School of Public Health that tested the benefits of standing desks. The study, which monitored 167 employees in a Texan call center over a six-month period, found that employees using stand-capable desks were more productive than their colleagues in standard, seated desks. And, the productivity of the standing-desk workers continued to increase over their seated colleagues steadily. In the first month, the stand-capable group had 23 percent more successful calls than their seated colleagues, and by the sixth month, they had 53 percent more successful calls.",
"From the battle for women’s suffrage to the continued fight for pay equity, women have been fighting to have their voices heard and ideas valued for generations. The recent emergence of the #metoo movement—to say nothing of the elevation of politicians and judges who appear to treat women with less than perfect respect—has only added to the urgency of this fight. After all, it’s been made clear that simply having something to say or even being the smartest person in a room doesn’t guarantee that a female voice will heard.

On Sunday, the first day of the Forbes Under 30 Summit in Boston, Massachusetts, Catt Sadler, Jenny Han, Wade Davis and Emery Whalen spoke about the ways in which women can own their voices and best use the seats at whatever table they’re sitting at. Each panelist comes from a different industry than the next, but all four have had experiences in raising their voice to advocate for themselves, their salary or their story. Catt Sadler is a former E! host who found out that her male counterpart was paid twice the amount she was; she ended up leaving the network after it declined to pay her more. (NBCUniversal, which owns E!, has said that it pays employees fairly and equally.) Jenny Han is the author of To All The Boys I've Loved Before, a book that was turned into a movie released on Netflix in August; Han insisted on casting an Asian American actress to play the main character and ultimately made the movie with the only production company that agreed with that vision. Wade Davis is a former NFL player and a diversity and inclusion consultant, and Emery Whalen is the CEO and cofounder of QED Hospitality, a restaurant group based in New Orleans whose work often finds Whalen as the only woman at the table.

Here are some highlights—and usable tips—from the conversation:

Catt Sadler: “As women, we’ve grown up in a ‘I’m just lucky to have this job’ culture. The onus is on us to shed that old way of asking for more money. That should be the first thing we should ask. If we’re employed, we are valuable. Period.”

Sadler also addressed the “if you work hard, your work will be noticed” myth: “I always thought my work was good enough to speak for itself. Its okay to use your voice. When it comes to making more money or at least the same, back it up. It’s not just about doing a good job anymore. Walk in there and say I did this, this and this. We have to use our voices to our benefit.”

Wade Davis: “Know the difference between wishing and dreaming. Bet on yourself and take a risk.”

Davis also discussed how men can best advocate for women: “Any man, including myself, claims to be a gender advocate, put them on a one-day contract. Oftentimes our allyship or advocacy is fleeting. But what are you going to do tomorrow? And does your work start at the margins of the margins? Your work can’t start with people with privilege and power.”

Emery Whalen: “You already have your voice. Stand tall, put your shoulders back, and stand your sacred ground, because it’s yours. And also remember that kindness is a show of strength, not weakness.""

Whalen also talked about how she’s been able to rise to the top of the restaurant industry so quickly: “By being the smartest one in the room. I got real good at construction real fast. Part of the reason I was driven to learn more was I had so much more to prove.”

Jenny Han: “Finding my voice was about asserting myself as an author. In a moviemaking process, authors generally aren’t welcome. … For me, early on I had to assert myself because in early talks with producers and studios people didn’t understand why the movie needed to cast an Asian-American as the lead. They’d say, ‘As long as they embody the spirit of the character, it works.’ My reply: ’The spirit of the character is Asian.’ ”

Han also echoed what Whalen said about subject-matter expertise: “Make yourself invaluable and irreplaceable so people literally can’t do the job without you.”",
"At the DigitaLatest Conference at Industry City, Brooklyn this past August, where leading established and recently skyrocketing digital marketing platforms, tools and technologies presented latest capabilities and user trends, two of the fastest growing digital formats were at opposite ends of the time spectrum.  David Rosenberg, head of business development at Giphy, talked about the rapid growth in popularity of short form content: 3-second gifs that often convey meaning and emotions, like different types of love or humor, more effectively, memorably and virally than words, and short-form, 6-second ads that have become widely adopted.

In contrast, Lex Friedman, chief business development officer at Midroll Media, the largest global podcast content producer and a pioneer in the field, talked about the explosive growth of long form podcast listening over the past 12 years to an estimated 67 million people in 2017, approximately the same number that listen to Twitter on a monthly basis.  That was roughly 25% of the U.S. population over age 12 in 2017, up 45% from 2015, and up 180% from 2009.  Podcast penetration is strongest among the 18-34 demo, which can be difficult for many advertisers to reach.  The average podcast is 45 minutes and the average podcast ad is 90 seconds... much longer than traditional ads.  A remarkable attentiveness measure according to Edison Research, is that 85% of people who listen to podcasts, listen to the end.

Midroll just passed an important milestone, signaling mainstream adoption of podcasting as a marketing tool.  While direct response firms were the first major supporters of the platform, traditional brands now make up 50% of Midroll’s ad revenue.  Podcast listening seems to be habit forming.  According to the 2017 Edison Research study, the average podcast listener listened to five podcasts per week.

Because most podcast ads are:

- Read by podcasters, whom listeners have chosen to hear for the full duration of the podcast, and like and trust

- Much longer than other ads, with more content and information

- Less predictable than other ad forms, due to the presenter's customized ""spin""…

traditional ad evaluation and effectiveness scores tend to be high relative to other forms of advertising, for important metrics such as:

What’s Behind Podcast Growth and Why It’s Expected to Continue

Podcast growth is a virtuous cycle and aligns with important trends:

Why Podcast Listening Is Expected to Keep Growing

Some of the best, most engaging brand podcasts thematically support and add value to the brand's positioning and values. A range of examples includes:

For those brands that have not already jumped in, it might be worth a try.  The content needs to add value to consumers' lives or it won't be worth their time to listen.  If the content does add value and engage the target, a branded podcast can be a real win.  I even have a podcast about innovation.  I was interviewed about new ways companies can make their firms more innovative in a Google Partners Partners podcast with Alex Langshur, founder and co-CEO at Cardinal Path, part of the Dentsu Aegis group.",None
"No one likes a wiseacre… unless he’s mocking something, you don’t like.

In Big Game: The NFL In Dangerous Times, Mark Leibovich takes on the entire establishment of professional football. Leibowitz shines a light brightest on NFL commissioner Roger Goodell. With the league under fire for issues such as players’ taking a knee to CTE and declining TV ratings, Goodell takes the heat for the 32 (or really 31 owners because Green Bay is owned by fans). For that – and importantly for negotiating the NFL’s huge television rights contracts – Goodell is paid handsomely, more than $40 million last year.

Joe Nocera wrote a critical review of Big Game in the Washington Post stating that the book did not reveal anything new to him about the league except insider gossip. He cited Leibovich’s snarkiness as a liability.  Fair enough comment, but Nocera – a legendary reporter himself who has covered business, politics and sports – misses something.

Leibovich is satirizing those who hold themselves above others. Being snarky about the disadvantaged and downtrodden is cruel. When aiming a barbed pen at the high and mighty, especially when they pose as do-gooders, Leibovich is following in the grand tradition of Jonathan Swift and Sinclair Lewis. And it is Lewis’s novel Babbitt, a satire of middle-class conformity, that resonates most in Big Game. Although the class Leibowitz lampoons is more billionaire than the middle.

The wisecracking, or snarkiness, comes when Leibovich uses the words and actions of the league bigwigs to lampoon their pomposity. For example, the NFL’s logo is referred to as ""The Shield"" and in some passages, Leibovich uses the term so often you get the feeling it is nothing more than a “shield” from avoiding the truth about tough issues like player health and lack of guaranteed salaries. Goodell even suggested to Leibovich, perhaps in jest, that he call his book, “The Shield.”

Leibovich does not spare his own fandom from criticism. As a kid growing up in New England, he’s a die-hard Patriots fan, something most of the rest of the fans of the league despite due to their winning ways. Owner Robert Kraft views himself as integral to Patriot success – like head coach Bill Belichick and quarterback Tom Brady – and would like induction into the NFL’s Hall of Fame. Leibovich interviews Kraft, father of four, who has a habit of calling Pats players to whom he is close to as a “fifth son,” among them Randy Moss, Willie McGinest and of course Brady. And it’s Brady, who like Liebowitz is an alumnus of the University of Michigan, where the author confesses to his “fanboy” allegiance to humorous effect.

There are moments, however, where Leibovich plays it straight, especially when discussing the brutality of the game that has wreaked havoc with players’ bodies and sadly their minds ravaged by successive concussions. Leibovich says – as many others have – that playing in an NFL game is like being in a car wreck. Muscle upon bone whacks week after week.

Also, there is a moving passage about attending the 2017 funeral of NFL patriarch Dan Rooney of the Pittsburgh Steelers. The funeral was attended by the NFL brass and players but also by thousands of fans who never met Rooney personally but appreciated his stewardship of their team. They showed up in Steeler jerseys. Rooney’s era is in contrast to the fast-money track of the majority of NFL owners.

Stewardship is not a word applied to owners who, like Stan Kroenke (Rams), Dean Spanos (Chargers) and Mark Davis (Raiders), move their teams to different cities. Owners use the threat of relocating their teams as weapons to wring concessions from local municipalities to fund ever-more gaudy stadiums that supposedly enhance the local economy.

That is Babbit redux, indeed, because economic studies, such as this one from the St. Louis Federal Reserve, reveal that taxpayer-supported stadiums do not deliver satisfactory returns on investment. And there is no Shield large enough to change that scenario.",
"In about five seconds, all of the Halloween costumes and decor will be whisked off to the clearance aisle and stores will become one big explosion of red and green. Wasn’t it just summer?

The holidays sneak up on us faster than the sudden emergence of pumpkin spice in September so it’s important to start planning for them now.

Nearly three-quarters of Americans say they fail to budget properly for the holidays.

And for a lot of people, this means going into debt. Consumers who went into debt last holiday season racked up $1,054 in new debt on average.

The majority of this overspending is due to gifts. While it’s nice to give, most of the people you love wouldn’t want you to go into debt because of them.

Here are a few tips to prepare for the holiday season so that you can close out 2018 with some financial success instead of money stress.

The average American spends nearly $1,000 on holiday shopping. For most people, that’s a significant chunk -- if not all -- of what’s left over after you pay your monthly bills. That means, if you wait until December to start shopping you are much more likely to spend money you don’t have.

Instead, start saving now. Set up a separate savings account specifically for your holiday fund. That way you won’t be tempted to spend it on something else. Saving $333/month over three months is a lot more achievable than coming up with $1,000 on the spot.

To make saving as easy as possible, set up automatic transfers on the day you get paid. That way, your money will be transferred to your holiday savings account before you even have the chance to spend it on something else.

When people overspend on gifts it’s usually because they are strapped for time. Don’t be the guy running around the mall with bags full of cable knit sweaters and peppermint bubble bath. When you wait until the last minute, finding a meaningful gift at an affordable price is pretty much impossible.

To avoid spending twice as much for a half as good gift, open the notepad on your phone right now and list each person you need to buy a gift for and how much you’d like to spend on them.

As you think of perfect gift ideas, jot them down. In fact, start buying gifts as you come across them. By planning ahead, you’re much more likely to find deals on items that the people in your life will really love.

Nearly a quarter of adults say they usually buy themselves gifts over the holidays. This can be good or bad depending on how you approach it so “treat yourself” with caution.

If you usually end up buying random items just because they’re on sale, then you are falling victim to the retail industry’s tactics to get you to spend more. Just because something is on sale doesn’t mean it’s going to make you happy or be worth what you spent.

Combat temptation by first acknowledging that retailers are actively trying to tempt you when you are shopping. Then, plan to self-gift the smart way.

Keep a list for yourself where you write down items that you really want or need. Then when holiday sales come around, use the list to guide your purchases.

Waiting to buy items at a much lower price point that you were planning on purchasing anyway is a really smart money move. Going into debt for a bunch of impulse purchases definitely is not.",
"Whether it's finally screwing up the courage to put in for that promotion, taking the leap into entrepreneurship, or even getting up the nerve to ask the love of your life to marry you, seizing most big opportunities in life requires bravery. And lack of courage is what leads to our most painful regrets.

Which leaves lots of folks thinking that they'd be more successful and happier if they were a little more courageous.

But psychology shows bravery isn't something we're either born with or we're not. It's a muscle that you can strengthen with practice. In a recent article for UC Berkeley's Greater Good Science Center Kate Swoboda, the author of the book , suggested exercises to help you build up your courage. Here are three simple ones to get started on today.

1. Get to know what fear feels like.

Fear is what stops most of us from being braver, but what exactly is fear? If you look closely at what we mean by the term, you'll observe a set of physical feelings -- sweaty palms, a racing heart, a tight knot in your chest. Swoboda insists that if you examine those sensations, you can learn to tame them.

""Once our bodies head into fear mode, we need a way to recognize the signs and work with what the feelings are telling us. A body-based practice can help,"" she claims. ""Using focused breathing or body scans--both practices associated with mindful meditation--can help us tune into our body's sensations without trying to change them or judge them. In this way, we can access our fear without rejecting it or being pulled into an old fear routine.""

2. Use writing to calm your inner critic.

Physical panic can stop you from pursuing your deepest dreams, but so can that nasty voice inside your head that tells you you'll never succeed, people will laugh at you, or you're not good enough. Most of us try to ignore or talk back to our inner critics, but Swoboda suggests another strategy.

""If we can take time to listen to our inner critic without attachment--without the need to ignore or accept what it is saying--we're in a better position to learn from it,"" she writes. ""Expressive writing... can help us to understand the origins of our critical thoughts and to glean helpful information without getting hijacked.""

No one is brave in a vacuum. Humans are social creatures and we draw our strength from others. If you want to be courageous enough to change your life, start by consciously choosing to spend more time around those that bring out your bravery.

Swoboda quotes Charles Duhigg, author of : ""For most people who overhaul their lives, there are no seminal moments or life-altering disasters. There are simply communities--sometimes of just one other person--who make change believable. Making change is simply easier when we have support.""",
"You think the time has come. You are ready to be promoted to your next position with your current employer so you’ve been applying for several positions, but none have come through for you. You feel that you have been in the same position for too long, and now your career prospects are starting to look bleak – at least with your current organization. To get out this rut, you have to figure out what you may be doing wrong.

I am privileged to speak confidentially with a lot of different managers and executives from a lot of different industries, and here are the top two reasons they have shared with me for why they don’t promote certain employees to higher positions of authority or responsibility even when that individual appears to be an otherwise high performer.

1. You Aren’t Genuinely Open To Feedback Or Constructive Criticism

As difficult as it might be to receive what you perceive as negative information about your work performance or project deliverables, it is crucial that you not only seek out feedback but also appear to welcome it. The time to worry is not when you are getting constructive criticism. The time to worry is when you are no longer receiving it.

If your supervisor or colleagues are no longer offering up any meaningful feedback, it typically means they have given up on you. When people care about you, they really do want to help you do your best work. When you make it difficult for those around you to give you honest feedback, you will surely lose. After they stop caring, the feedback and constructive criticism will stop coming, and this is when you know that your career with this particular organization is indeed in trouble.

How you demonstrate this:

When you resist feedback and constructive criticism, your colleagues can easily tell because you make it very uncomfortable and difficulty for them to give you any. You do this by quickly coming up with excuses and reasons for why information you are receiving is somehow incorrect or why the person giving it is mistaken in his/her findings.

You do this by crossing your arms and becoming openly defensive or even hostile in your body language when someone tries to deliver feedback. You demonstrate resistance by trying to justify the points at issue instead of soaking in what you are hearing and processing it respectfully. You show your disdain for the feedback by not responding with any meaningful questions or positive responses, and you certainly don’t attempt to expand the conversation to learn specifics or understand how or what you can change.

Why this is stalling your career:

This is stalling your career because people start to view you as closed minded when it comes to your own professional development and growth, and they see this as a problem for the organization as a whole if you were to be promoted. Leaders and managers want to work with people who can be developed and who clearly seek out methods and ways to learn and grow so they can deliver higher and higher levels of performance.

Remaining open to receive guidance, advice and feedback from others is a critical element of leadership success, and it is very important for team development and cohesiveness. When a person is open to feedback and constructive criticism, he demonstrates it by proactively seeking out and creating the space for others to honestly share their thoughts on his performance, work product and service deliverables. This employee intentionally engages in dialogue to not only learn what people think about his work, but also why they think it and how he might improve in certain areas.

2. You Cater To Positions And Titles But Neglect Regular People

You think you have your eye on the ball – you even consider yourself to be one of the company’s rock stars. You are focused on understanding the organizational strategy and achieving operational goals. You know what the KPIs (key performance indicators) are and you excel at achieving them, but everyone knows that you don’t really care about the people. You too often show that other employees don’t really matter to you. Despite your high performance, you are indeed failing.

How you demonstrate this:

When it comes to people with power and status within the organization, you are up at the ready and insist on meeting their needs, but when you perceive colleagues or managers to be lacking in power and status, you are quick to neglect their needs. If you perceive someone to be inferior to you or disconnected from your career trajectory, their concerns or struggles just don’t make your radar and never will make your priority list.

You demonstrate your lack of value for every-day employees and those without power and status by saying and doing things such as this.

Other people can see that you clearly have a preference for the so-called ‘somebodies’ within the organization and view all the other people as ‘nobodies.’ They don’t like it.

Why this is stalling your career:

This is stalling your career because you happen to work in an organization where the ends does not justify the means. The people where you work have established standards for how everyone should be treated and defined values for a high-performance workplace that extends beyond simply accomplishing performance goals. Where you work, things like behavior, respect and value for each individual matter, and you forgot to take this into account when you set out to be a star performer.

This is stalling your career because the messages you send in the workplace matter just as much as the performance goals you accomplish. You aren’t being promoted because you have become viewed as someone who will lift himself up by pulling other people down. You are viewed as someone who sees everyone else as there to elevate you and your needs while you neglect their needs. You have made it about you too often and too much, and others have noticed. They care that you act like you matter – you even act like they matter – but others clearly don’t. They care that you send messages and use language that implies that anyone else could be insignificant or inferior.

The most effective organizations strive to elevate and promote those performers who welcome feedback and show appreciation and value for every person within the organization. You aren’t being promoted where you are because you still haven’t gotten this.",coaching
"When it comes to the initial stages of a startup, the focus is often on creating a minimum viable product (MVP), which involves having a limited feature set. The goal is to test the market, especially with early adopters. And yes, this is a good approach. Just look at the success of companies like Dropbox and Airbnb.

But there is a major issue – that is, the transition away from an MVP. If anything, this should be fairly quick. The reason is that you want to make sure your product has a solid foundation that allows for scale and adaptability.

So how to go about doing this? Well, the CEO and founder of Measure Square, Steven Wang, definitely knows how. His company provides software and apps to help contractors and installers streamline the process of developing floorplans, 3D diagrams, quotes and proposals. Measure Square has over 3,600 customers, including larger enterprises like Sherwin-Williams, Daltile and Rite Rug.

However, the process of building Measure Square has not been easy. Keep in that Steven bootstrapped the company.

Oh, and yes, some of his lessons were learned the hard way. One was the use of outsourcing. While it did save some money – which was certainly important for Measure Square because of its tight budget – it still turned out to be the wrong strategy. “We did not have enough control over the process,” said Steven. “The quality of the design was usually off and it was difficult making the necessary adjustments. Software development needs tremendous focus on the details.”

So he then took the step of building his own team, which was located in China. “This was one of the best decisions we made,” said Steven. “I’m not sure we would have survived if we continued with outsourcing.”

But there was another challenge: Measure Square was originally built in the Java language. “Unfortunately, it was the wrong choice,” said Steven. “It was not fast enough for our graphics-intensive functions and the UI elements were lacking.”

He knew there had to be another way. To this end, he looked at C#, which is a language from Microsoft. There was also the use of the Xamarin platform. “By using these tools,” said Steven, “we had a single code source, which made things much easier. We were also able to port our software to Windows, iOS and Android. This greatly expanded our market opportunity.”

Next, as web services and APIs became more popular, Steven looked at these technologies as a way to create even more competitive advantages. “Building an API infrastructure allows you to quickly expand your footprint without adding much cost,” he said. “We have been able to build geometric libraries for home structure models, material assignments, pattern designs, material estimation, installation planning and even web-based CRM for project management.”

The API strategy has also made it much easier to forge alliances with partners. Consider that Creating Your Space and Flooring Liquidators use Measure Square’s calculator tool for lead generation and custom orders. Then there are the web services for Lowe’s and Home Depot (Canada) installers that provide for handling internal management capabilities. What's more, Measure Square is leveraging the technology to help World Floor Covering Association (WFCA) build an app that allows retailers to easily lookup inventory levels from different vendors.

“We have just scratched the surface of the opportunities with APIs,"" said Steven.  ""And it did take some time to create this architecture.  But in the end, it has been well worth the effort.""

"During a recent keynote on success strategies for both work and life, one of the attendees asked about how to deal with perfectionism. I have heard from people who spend so much time completing a project that it’s late. Others spend so much time on a project that they fall behind on other equally important or even more important tasks. Still others want to make a change, maybe take on a new responsibility, but are afraid to fall short.

Avoiding opportunities, falling behind, and overworking are just some of the very real consequences of perfectionism. If you are finding that the quest for perfection is hurting your progress, it’s time to change your focus and prioritize other quests than trying to be perfect . Here are four ways you can keep perfectionism in check:

Sometimes perfectionism rears its ugly head when a goal is defined too narrowly, making it an all-or-nothing proposition. For example, if you define the perfect career as meaning a promotion to leadership, then anything short of that will disappoint. However, if you brainstorm multiple ways to attain career success beyond a specific title (in fact, you don’t need to move up to move your career forward), then you can focus on a number of career improvements --  making a lateral move and learning a new area; expanding your thought leadership outside your company; taking on a leadership role in your community – and get unstuck from one definition of success.

If perfectionism is keeping you from turning in a project or moving onto other tasks, then change your priority from finishing a task to starting a new one . Make a successful day one where you initiated or made some movement on a set number of tasks. Your strong finishing tendencies will invariably take over and you will finish more than you expected, by first prioritizing getting started.

If you normally don’t start on new tasks before one task is finished, practice a new rhythm for working by setting a timer for work and resting, and switching tasks at each segment. Try 25 minutes on with 5 minutes off, 50 minutes on with 10 minutes off, or 75 minutes on with 15 minutes off. I wouldn’t go longer than 90 minutes without a break because your productivity is probably dragging at that point and you just don’t realize it! Pick three projects or tasks to alternate, and do your best for the work period you selected. Then take a true rest (I like to have a pot of tea at my desk so I can pour myself a treat and just sit in silence), and move to your next task. You can try this work/rest/switch routine in the morning and then spend the afternoon finishing up.

Work expands to fit the time allotted. When your boss comes to you with an analysis that needs to be completed in two hours, you figure out how to get the information needed and calculated in two hours. If you had till tomorrow, you may add more research or additional calculations, and these may or may not add that much more value. This doesn’t mean that should never take more time on a task – that’s where your professional judgment comes in! But if you have perfectionist tendencies, you probably overengineer a solution where a simpler one will do, and one way to keep your time in check is to move up your deadlines. If you have already broadened your goals, if you prioritize starting over finishing and if you build a routine of work/rest  segments, then you’ll have so much more to do that the artificial deadlines you set may start to feel more real.",

"Ask any number of leaders what their favorite management duty is, and I’ll bet not one will say managing conflict. Yet, conflict is an inevitable part of workplace relationships.

The temptation is to ignore conflict in hopes that it will resolve itself, or simply crush it and move on. After all, people get defensive, emotions get in the way — it’s not productive. Or fun. But should you avoid it at all costs? Absolutely not.

There are real consequences to no conflict, most notably the risk of groupthink, a lack of creativity, artificial harmony and low employee engagement, all of which can stagnate or even permanently sabotage the productivity and performance of a team.

Likewise, there can be clear benefits to conflict if it’s the good kind. Conflict in and of itself does not have to be negative. But to move conflict from destructive to productive requires trust, transparency and a full commitment to behaviors that fuel constructive conflict.

How each of us responds to conflict is completely within our control. The automatic thoughts that pop into our head at the point of conflict and trigger negative behavior, such as “You have no idea what you’re talking about,” “I don’t have time for this,” or “How dare you challenge me,"" can be reframed to produce a more positive response.

Next time someone pushes your buttons, take 10 seconds (while you also take a deep breath and step away from the emotion) to stop and ask yourself, ""Am I overreacting? Could there be another way I could look at this?""

Yes, this takes practice and self-control but is certainly worth the effort when you consider the upside of healthy conflict. If you practice it enough, soon it will simply be how you naturally react.

Here are four reasons why conflict is good for the progress and growth of your team, department and organization:

• Conflict promotes open-mindedness and allows people to be heard. This fosters employee engagement and forces people to really listen. That’s the key: truly listening. When you listen, you learn and gain insights, which opens your mind to new perspectives and thinking.

• Conflict strengthens relationships and bolsters understanding. Mutual understanding fuels respect, which opens the door to empathy, which in turn builds rapport. These are all necessary ingredients to strengthen relationships, and when you’re in a relationship with someone, it’s so much easier to find a beneficial resolution.

• Conflict fuels breakthrough ideas and innovation. Working through conflict pushes people to go further in their thinking, to build on the viewpoints of others and generate bigger and better ideas that might never have been considered.

• Conflict challenges the status quo and accelerates growth. In today’s competitive marketplace, where technological advances drive success, those companies that don’t have a growth mindset and are content with the status quo run a huge risk of obsolescence. Think Blockbuster or Radio Shack.

So, bring on the conflict. Invest the time in yourself and your people to develop productive conflict practices and behaviors that boost the right kind of conflict and accelerate growth.",coaching
"The apparel industry is one of the largest in the world, generating a global value of about $3 trillion (2% of global GDP) and employing some 100 million people. Its unrivaled creativity, diversity and innovation mean that even the smallest stakeholders can find space to pioneer new trends and challenge established norms. Now innovation in the fashion industry is finding new meaning in the 21st century -- meaning focused first and foremost on economic development, environmental sustainability, and empowerment of workers.

Long-time industry strategists agree that it’s a moment ripe for invention and new partnerships aimed at shaping the industry’s future and aligning it more closely with human and environmental sustainability -- and with the values of new consumers. With this in mind, C&A Foundation and Ashoka launched an alliance based on mutual interest in powering new solutions for systemic industry change. Called Fabric of Change, the three-year effort surfaced some powerful innovators and principles that forecast industry shifts.

Social entrepreneurs are pioneering the future of the apparel industry

Nicole Rycroft, founder of Canopy and a serial social entrepreneur, is well-known for “greening” the publishing industry and the Harry Potter book series. Seeing great potential impact now in the fashion industry, Rycroft recently launched Canopy Style to engage over 100 clothing brands in championing conservation and seeking out new and sustainable ways to source materials. With C&A Foundation resources and Ashoka’s intensive accelerator and catalytic support, Canopy has nearly doubled its impact: the group now works with 80% of the world's viscose producers who are committing to moving away from endangered forest sourcing practices.

For changemakers just starting out like Akshay Sethi, founder of Ambercycle, Fabric of Change proved game-changing. Ambercycle uses genetically engineered microbes to digest polyester textiles and transform them into material that can be used as new fibers. (Polyester is the most used fabric of mass-produced clothing and a main source of microplastics, particles that damage our oceans and rivers.) Identified early stage through a global competition that attracted 350 entrants, Ambercycle is now connected to major industry players and Ashoka’s mentorship helped its team attract and secure an investment of half a million dollars.

More collective impact is needed to change the industry

Beyond spotting and supporting emerging innovators, Fabric of Change seeded unusual and much needed connections. It supported changemakers working along the fashion industry supply chain all over the world to gather, connect, and share insights and experiences. Ashila Mapalagama, a textile worker in Sri Lanka developing a system of social insurance as an alternative to traditional unions; Gabriel Rivera, a Mexican engineer empowering women home workers in Mexico through access to credit and markets; Stacy Flynn, a sourcing specialist making new fiber from cotton garment waste in the United States. These innovators, along with Rycroft, Sethi, and 26 other social entrepreneurs got to meet, share and start weaving a ""mosaic of solutions"" to collectively champion changes in the industry status quo.

Beyond peer to peer connections, the initiative attracted the attention of brands and media looking for out-of-the-box solutions. Ashoka, a specialist in social innovation trends, contributed greater visibility to the community through a report highlighting innovative insights coming out of this powerful network. As a result, Ikea, Corte Ingles and several other companies are now taking note of social entrepreneurs as valuable partners in sustainable innovation for their core business.

To carry this work forward, a robust community of changemakers must be supported -- both social entrepreneurs and corporate intrapreneurs. Incentives for industry leaders to act must be strengthened. And social entrepreneurs and their solutions must be elevated and amplified, thus paving the way for business models that allow for both economic performance and social impact.

"Despite the avalanche of digital connections, we’re not making the connections that matter, according to research by O.C Tanner. Its 2018 Global Culture report shows that 42% of respondents don’t have a close friend at work. Not surprisingly then, 46% of respondents reported feeling lonely.

Gary Beckstrand, vice-president at O.C Tanner, argues that when workplaces are built with intentionality and enable peer interaction, employees are 84% more likely to have a close friend at work, 92% more likely to feel optimistic about the future and 42% more likely to trust their team members. It also has an impact on their well-being – there is a 28% increase in an employees’ sense of well-being.

The level of isolation experienced by generations varies, according to O.C Tanner research: IGen (45%) and Millennials (35%) feel considerably more isolated than Baby Boomers (24%) and Gen X (25%).

Beckstrand remarked that connection is only authentic, if people know the real person. According to O.C Tanner’s research, only 58% of employees say their team knows the “real me” and 58% have a close friend at work.

This one was a bit startling – we have asked this before in a slightly different way – “best friend” at work. I anticipated we would see a much higher percentage. I guess this is not as surprising as one would think, given that only 62% report that they take time to get their colleagues personally and only 53% report that colleagues take time to get to know them personally.”

A culture where people feel disconnected at work doesn’t just hurt employees. The Center for Prevention and Health estimates mental illness and substance abuse caused by poor emotional well-being costs employers $79-$105 billion every year through reduced productivity, absenteeism and increased healthcare costs.

It’s a social coming together and we neglect to think about this. We did a lot of research with Cisco where we looked at what happened when the organization becomes dispersed and fragmented. Who are the people who are more successful at working in a dispersed environment? We found that the people who are better at working away from the organization are much more extrovert. This is because extroverts seek much more social stimulation to talk to people whereas introverts struggle to work away. When you’re more reserved, you find yourself days on end without talking to people.”

In its 2018 global culture report, O.C Tanner interviewed focus groups to get their thoughts on the importance of connection in the workplace. There were three main themes identified among the focus groups when it came to the importance of connection in the workplace.

1. People want to connect with their “second family.” Employees are working harder and spending more time in the workplace. Most employees spend more time at work than they do at home with their families on a given day. Connections and relationships at work create a more positive work experience. That’s important when people work 8-12 hours a day, five days a week.

2. Connections promote a sense of belonging. Humans are social creatures. We innately want to interact with other people. Employees want to fit in and belong in their organization. They want to feel part of a team. A lack of connection leads to loneliness and uncertainty of whether or not the employee belongs at the organization.

3. Connections create a feeling of making a difference. We hear over and over again that employees aren’t there just for the job. They want to feel a part of something bigger, contribute to a meaningful purpose, make a difference in the world. They want to strive for a common goal together, tackle challenges together, and find success",
"And so it was last week that Ryan Austin Dean posted a dramatic tweet that concerned his 3-year-old son River and a trip on American Airlines.

Honestly, when you saw the picture of his son in hospital, which was part of the tweet, you'd surely have experienced sympathy.

Our 3-year-old's appendix ruptured, yet @AmericanAir will not even rescind $400 in change fees for our rescheduled trip because his appendix didn't rupture ""the day of the flight.""



Honestly, this is why airlines are becoming so hated. pic.twitter.com/3SccDvjvXg -- Ryan Austin Dean (@RyanAustinDean) October 2, 2018

Then again, we're talking about American Airlines here. Its CEO has a deep and abiding commitment to change fees being a vital element in its lifeblood.

He claims that if the airline was prevented from charging them, American wouldn't offer changeable tickets at all.

In Dean's case, many might easily imagine -- however unfairly -- that the airline wouldn't have been effusive in its sympathy. Dean certainly didn't feel the airline's warmth.

He followed his dramatic tweet with another, this time offering an exchange between himself and American that was less than complimentary. It read:

The tweet appeared to show a standard written answer that did, indeed, appear to lack both heart and a clear understanding.

A spokesman told me that, contrary to some reports, one tweet doesn't express all the direct messages that followed between American and Dean. He said:

That's a lie on their part. I spoke to them on the phone in a hospital family room and fully explained that my toddler had emergency surgery. They said they wouldn't do anything because the medical emergency wasn't the day of the flight.

Yes, but American says it was all solved by Direct Messages. Dean told me that the initial messaging happened by phone and on other social media. He said:

Ah, so it was the unruly power of Twitter that got someone at American to see the potential PR disaster looming?

Having seen some of those Direct Messages, it's clear that Dean told American's customer service that he wasn't mad at them personally, but at the the airline's policies.

Other airlines, such as Southwest, seem to do without them just fine.

When you charge $200 for a couple of characters typed on a keyboard, you're not likely to ever garner sympathy.

That's something American and other airlines seem to find so hard to understand.

Or perhaps, some might wonder, they find it hard to really care.",None
"Research from Stanford University shows that 80 percent of CEO's have a mentor they felt was critical for their success and that mentors are vital for entrepreneurial success as well.

The six types of mentors that follow will push you to the front of the line as an entrepreneur or in corporate life (and they don't necessarily have to be 6 different people).

This type of mentor is an expert in your industry or chosen path and can dramatically shorten the learning curve for you. They share their ""been there, done that"" perspective and illuminate your category in ways that would take you years to see. They can cut through systems and processes and are adept at getting things done--the kind of things that you want to get done. They can share hard lessons learned and best practices as they blazed a path similar to the one you want to be on.

As I became an entrepreneur, I had several Path Blazer mentors (current speakers and authors) that taught me what to expect in the professional speaking world and in the universe of authorship. I even enrolled some online help by investing in courses from ""virtual mentors"" like Michael Hyatt.

It's irrefutable. Making the effort and investment to learn from those who went before you is one of the fastest ways to jumpstart your journey.

I, like many adults, like to think out loud. And I don't like to think in a vacuum. So what do you do when you're a solopreneur or tucked away in an isolated business environment? You go out and find a Sounding Board mentor.

Anyone who has ever ""bounced something off"" someone knows it can sharpen thinking and generate confidence in or poke holes in ideas. Research from Berkeley even found having a sounding board you can debate ideas with can generate 25 percent more ideas altogether.

This mentor type serves as a role model for success as they've simply achieved so much. He/she doesn't have to be in your industry; in fact, it's better if they aren't so you get fresh perspective on the art and science of success in and of itself.

There's a reason why there is so much written on principles for success. A Success Magnet mentor helps uncover real world, visible lessons about what it takes to overcome obstacles of all types and succeed.

The Campaigner is a dedicated advocate; they're a fan of yours and will speak on your behalf in the pursuit of new career or business opportunities. They're both a reference and referrer, connecting you to possibilities. Some argue that mentors should be kept separate from such direct career/business enhancing tasks. I'm not one of them.

This mentor type is someone you can count on to tell you like it is. They know you well, know your strengths and opportunities, your background, and your tendencies. They won't let you off the hook. They'll hold up a mirror to you, forcing you to see yourself as is and things for the way they really are. They will challenge you, insert healthy tension into your path, and serve as an accountability partner.

Not the easiest mentor to work with. But the easy thing and the right thing rarely share the same road. The Mirror Mentor in my life has led to tremendous self-awareness and personal growth.

I knew a very high-ranking P&G official who every summer would enroll a summer intern to serve as a reverse mentor--someone who could share perspective from a position underneath himself. It was someone who could share how the exec was coming across to his organization, what stories were told about him.

It's mentoring, in reverse, because it's from the ground up rather than from the top down.  I've found Reverse Mentors a powerful way to ensure you're living true to your values and in a way congruent with the story you want to tell.",
"There was an air of unparalleled excitement as I slid into the cabin of a generous friend's newly delivered Model 3 (thanks, Brad). I both read and write about Tesla's CEO Elon Musk on a regular basis, but this was my first experience behind the wheel of one of his cars. Translation: anticipation was off the charts.

Sitting in the driver's seat for the first time was an incredible experience--one that I've never had with any car (probably because I drive a 2010 Kia--the year before they started getting cool again, mind you). I was instantly struck by the incredible design but ultimately realized:

Tesla has an experience problem--and a big one.

""Relax,"" my brain tried to tell me, ""this car is way smarter than you are"". After a brief hesitation, Brad assured and reassured what I needed to do to effectively operate, so I took a deep breath, realized that I already trusted technology with my work, my money, and my privacy (sometimes)--trusting it with my life was just the next logical step. Tesla...take the wheel.

I'll also preface this by firmly stating that it's the driver's responsibility to maintain control of the vehicle at all times. My first career was in auto-insurance--so I know a thing or two about liability, a driver's duty, and the rules of the road (also guilty of being a terrible backseat driver). I did not educate myself and read all the 'fine print' of the do's and don'ts of AutoPilot, but wanted to give it a spin, with the clear assumption of assuming all risks associated.

AutoPilot felt fine at first, but in 2 instances with no oncoming traffic, would confusingly veer and cross over the double line instead of taking an expected, wider turn. Brad suggested that with oncoming traffic, that wouldn't have happened, but either way, it left me feeling utterly uncomfortable. Not a good start.

We then decided to test the limits and go around a turn that I was fairly certain could be an issue. The suggested speed limit was 20 mph so I went down to 18 mph. The turn was ridiculously tight:

We came up on the turn and the Model 3 didn't even try to turn. It simply beeped to indicate AutoPilot was no longer on, requiring an immediate, manual takeover. I quickly reacted, took control, and turned to prevent going straight into a tree. Fear consumed me.

Not everyone who buys a Tesla knows that. Yes, it's the duty and liability of the driver to know this, but it's like blindly reading the Privacy Policy for every service/site you sign up--you just do it.

The crippling impact of fear and a negative experience

If design inspires trust, where does Tesla fall short with trust in the experience?  Look, I'm such a strong advocate for, one day, achieving a critical mass mainstream of autonomous vehicles--the potential benefits are incredible. However, if a driver has a negative experience today with the perception of what they know a Tesla is capable of, it could forever turn them off (not to mention their friends & family)--and that's a critical rate limiter for the autonomous quest.

Even if it was clearly known that it's the driver's full liability and they cause a fatal collision, I can't imagine that they would ever trust an autonomous vehicle again or be comfortable driving in one, which can create exponential ripple effects for the hope of market saturation.

Given all favorable press I'd seen, I was disappointed--and very discomfited. Naturally, I went to Google for some answers. It turned out I wasn't alone in my reservations at all. What Tesla is offering with its current self-driving package isn't so much a car that can drive itself as it is a car that lets you get away with paying slightly less attention than a normal vehicle. Yet, that's not really what the name 'AutoPilot' conveys. And while my impression is that Tesla has a long way to go in order to live up to the self-driving hype, some people have different opinions.",
"Our society seems to have launched a war against work. We’ve become obsessed with certain jobs and have developed complete disdain for others. It’s such backwards thinking. Why is it that we’ll stand in line for hours for a chance to watch a popular singer perform for thousands, but we view the person selling the singer’s concert tickets or serving us a meal as “less” of a person?

The most recent example of this was the attempt to shame actor Geoffrey Owens, of The Cosby Show fame, for holding down a job as a bagger at Trader Joe’s. Photos were secretly snapped of him on the job and went viral on social media, designed to show a man who had fallen to an all-time low.

It was promising to see so many people come to Owens’ defense and call out how honest work is something to be proud of. However, this isn’t always society’s response to jobs that are labeled as less than glamorous because they involve manual labor or command lower pay.

As I coach people and help them develop their careers, I come across an alarming number of people who view themselves as “less than” because of their job title, salary, or social status. It affects their performance, motivation, and self-esteem. But it shouldn’t.

You can bring respect—and greatness—to any job. Here are five ways to make it happen:

Do everything with greatness. When I’m working one-on-one with people, they often share they’re in a job they hate or are barely tolerating. They describe the job as if it’s beneath them; they don’t want to put too much effort into it because they’re afraid doing a good job will keep them stuck in that job.

Unfortunately, this is a recipe for practicing mediocrity. Why not practice greatness instead? When we don’t put in a full effort, our brains get used to limiting our engagement, creativity, and skill. We assume our brain will kick into gear once we land in the job we actually want. But this rarely happens. Instead, our brain becomes accustomed to holding back. Our brains atrophy when we don’t fully engage. In contrast, doing everything with greatness creates a positive ripple effect and enhances our reputation, which helps us move toward the work we want to do.

Value the commitment you’ve made to others, regardless of how they ‘show up.’ One of the most common complaints I hear from my coaching clients is that someone else isn’t showing up as their best selves. Someone else is failing to deliver, being a jerk, or going against her or his word. Now, don’t get me wrong; these are almost always valid complaints, but focusing on another person sets us up to spend our time reacting. When we do this, we decide to operate as a thermometer instead of a thermostat.

A thermometer is a very basic tool. It reacts to the temperature it’s surrounded by; it’s constantly reading the temperature, not creating it. A thermostat, on the other hand, is a sophisticated piece of equipment. It sets the temperature in the room, regardless of the temperature outside. In the workplace, be that thermostat. Set the temperate in the room. Commit to doing everything with greatness, even when coworkers are choosing to give less than their best.

Do the work for your own self-worth, instead of a pat on the back. This doesn’t mean that recognition or rewards are meaningless. But recognition should always be a nice-to-have versus a need-to-have. Too often, we hand over our sense of self-worth to others, whether they are truly suited or equipped to gauge whether we are doing great work. Instead, consider why you do the work you do. Focus on the impact you make that means something to you. Then, tune into feedback from others to gauge whether the work you are doing is resonating with them. If you receive accolades, think of them as the icing on the cake, not the cake itself.

Look inwards—not outwards—for validation. We all need to stop looking outside of ourselves for greatness. Stop looking for the promotion that will finally put enough letters in front of your title to make you feel successful. Stop looking for that end-of-year performance rating to tell you whether you are great. Stop begging for praise from your boss. Instead, recognize that whatever you choose as your line of business and career—this is where you will have the opportunity to practice greatness. No one else and nothing else will ensure that you live in your greatness. The choice and honor to practice greatness are yours.

Practice your greatness, whether you love your job or not. If you are washing dishes, do so with greatness. If you are cleaning someone’s teeth, do so with greatness. If you are heading up a board meeting, do so with greatness. If you are folding shirts, fixing a faucet, painting a house, performing surgery…well, you get my drift. Too often we assume the job is what determines our greatness. It is not. We determine the level of greatness we bring to what we do.",coaching
"Despite the fact, that franchising giants like Burger King, KFC, 7-Eleven, Dunkin’ Donuts, and Pizza Hut have had to deal with franchisee associations for many years, McDonald’s has never had a national franchisee association. Now, after all these years, things are about to change.

Various media outlets have reported, that 400 McDonald’s franchisees met recently in Tampa, Florida to present and discuss their complaints regarding recent McDonald’s marketing strategies. The franchisees who attended the meeting were reported to account for 25% of U.S. McDonald’s locations. A major complaint has been the requirement that franchisees have to remodel locations with innovations including touch-screen kiosks. The major complaint according to the Wall Street Journal is the result of franchisee site improvements, which haven’t led to sales increases. An ironic twist is that I was recently in a McDonald’s in the New York area that had installed the new ordering kiosks, which I found a bit confusing. I asked one of the counter clerks how sales were doing after the system was installed, and he replied: “not any different.” Obviously, this is purely anecdotal, but yet interesting, considering the news about disgruntled McDonald’s franchisees.

In a follow-up article, Franchise Times reported on October 12, that the McDonald’s operators at the National Owners Meeting in Tampa voted yes to form a self-funded franchisee association. FT stated that the next franchise meeting is scheduled for December 12 in Dallas.

""We always welcome and are committed to a constructive, collaborative dialogue with our franchisees,"" a McDonald's spokeswoman told CNBC in an email. ""We will continue to work closely with our franchisees, so they have the support they need to run great restaurants and provide great quality experiences and convenience for guests.""

Over the past few years, McDonald's corporate and it's franchisees have faced a number of challenges ranging from employee wage complaints to the NLRB, however, when it comes to franchisees, their revenue and profitability are top priorities. Despite changes in McDonald's leadership and menu changes, U.S. sales have been weak. With franchisees being required to make a substantial investment in their locations the expectation for increased sales is much higher. To date, many franchisees haven't experienced the increased sales they expected.

The establishment of the Coalition of Franchisee Associations several years ago and its ratification of the Franchisee Bill of Rights could portend more franchisees seeking to organize their own associations. How should franchisers deal with the formation of a franchisee association? Resist, encourage or remain neutral?

There have always been various opinions on the part of franchisers as to whether a franchiser should resist or support a franchisee association. Some franchisers believe, that unless there are significant problems with their franchisees, better to leave well enough alone. Moreover, some franchisers believed that if there is a franchisee association, then there will be an organized group that could thwart franchiser initiatives and possibly interfere with the operation of the franchise system. However, a good number of franchisers have fostered and encouraged franchisee organizations or advisory councils.

I'm of the opinion that a franchiser should encourage a franchisee association, once the system reaches a minimum size of 50-100 franchises. To resist or discourage the formation of an association because there is a fear that conflicts and major issues will arise belies good business sense. If the franchise program is flawed and franchisees are unhappy, then resisting an association is ignoring the obvious.  Franchisers have been able to work through some difficult problems because there was a franchisee association that the franchiser could work with.

A smaller franchise system can form an advertising or marketing committee that includes franchisee representatives. This can enable both parties to establish a working relationship and build mutual trust. It can also provide a forum for the franchiser to obtain feedback from the franchisees from time to time.

""Franchisors need to recognize that creating a clear two-way channel of communication with their franchisees which includes franchisee input on issues that impact the operator's bottom line is the best way to prevent the formation of outside franchisee associations"" Gary Occhiogrosso, Founder & Managing Partner Franchise Growth Solutions, LLC.

As the McDonald’s situation demonstrates, it’s inevitable that franchisees will speak among themselves and share both the good and the bad news. It’s far more effective for franchisers to recognize this fact, and strive to have a productive relationship with their franchise.",None
"Just as globalization affects culture, it just as certainly fuses into cuisine. And in my opinion, the two greatest cuisines in the world—Indian and Mexican—have seen the rise of an advanced palette. Gifted restaurateurs and their chefs are innovating to capture a larger audience of loyal patrons from outside the borders of their origins.

Owner Sonny Solomon and Executive Chef Binder Saini bring their credentials to their muse, Kurry Qulture, launched in 2015. Within 25 minutes--in easily accessible Astoria Queens--Manhattanites can take the N or W train from 59th Street and be seated with a glass of wine or a well-harmonized cocktail and prepare for a sensational culinary experience.

Sensational, yes, but this experience is distinctive. Expect it to transform your views on what is the latest and greatest in Indian food.

Solomon is a veteran restaurateur, coached by food icons like Madhur Jaffrey, Jean Georges, Jeffrey Zakarian, Terrance Brennan, Paul LeBrandt and Daniel Orr. Integrating his experiences, Solomon presents Indian food as a reflection of today’s India—a fireball of change, culture fusion and with an expanding role on the global economic stage.

He offers, “I wanted to make it fun—change the perception that all Indian food is too spicy and heavy—and allow for light, aromatic and flavorful tastes without excessive heat.” Kurry Qulture is the only Michelin-recommended Indian restaurant in Queens.

To further boast, Kurry Qulture was most recently awarded best Indian Restaurant 2019 by Bethpage Best of Boro.

A native of Punjab, Solomon, tells of India’s transformation over the last five decades, shown through the lens of Kurry Qulture’s interior. “I wanted to create an environment that reflects India as it moves from its regional to its global standard.”

“Our vision,” he says, “was to create an environment that speaks to India, not where it was or is, but to its expanding role in the global community. We didn’t want the restaurant to appear or feel like a traditional Indian restaurant. The lighting and design are contemporary and in alignment with the vision for the cuisine. Sophisticated. Eclectic. Nuanced.”

Saini, also a native of Punjab, joined Solomon in a shared vision of what’s next on Indian cuisine’s trend line and the culture demanding it.

Saini explains, “As India has many layers to it, so does its regional cuisine. For example, our Duck Bihari (from the Bihar region—inland and bordering Nepal) incorporates traditional spices, cinnamon, coriander, cumin and turmeric, red chili powder and bay leaf, creating a distinctive yet balanced flavor common there.” Chef Saini pulls from regional cuisine, but the magic is in how Saini modifies it to contemporary standards.

Dishes from Goa, known for its Portuguese influence, or Mumbai, where street food feeds the hungry laborer, are all examples of how Solomon and Saini fast-forward our Indian food experience beyond the expected.

Favorites include the cauliflower florets, flash-cooked and tossed in a garlic tomato catsup. Coconut pepper shrimp—known to Goa—offers a tantalizing start to your entree. Ask questions about the vegetarian options and enjoy Solomon’s or Saini’s learnings that make you want to go to India.

Punjabi breads offer chili garlic, olive garlic, onion parmesan and spinach goat cheese and other surprises. The chutneys are light and reflect the natural tastes of tomato, apple, pineapple and plum.

Mixologist Bo Dhale has created a fascinating set of mixed drinks, including the Hex Mex, Astoria Maili and the Diuia. The Astoria Maili is mixed with bourbon, sweet vermouth, lime and figs and is indescribably refreshing, lifting you up after a hard day at the office. All syrups are homemade, including pineapple and blackberry. Cilantro-infused gin and other offerings pair well with food offerings.

The bar area offers tables and banquets for a full meal or cocktails and appetizers, and the back courtyard is the perfect setting when weather permits

Kurry Qulture is located at 36-05 30th Avenue in Astoria. If you land at LaGuardia or live in Manhattan, Queens or Brooklyn, you are 25 minutes away from a feast that will have you coming back for more.

In closing, Saini says, “We want you to leave satisfied and wanting more.” As Solomon says, “We don’t want you to say ‘goodbye.’ We want you to say, ‘See you next time.’”",None
"Do you know that every person who works for you has a super power? Well, they do. Superman could lift tall buildings, and Luke Skywalker had the super powers of levitation and premonition (among others!). As a leader, your job is to figure out the natural gifts and abilities of each member of your team and draw them out.

A person’s super power is their particular genius: the specific, unique and specialized skill that they bring to the workplace. It is their secret sauce.

If you take the time to identify the super powers of your people, you will not only discover hidden talent, but you will inspire everyone to bring their personal best to work. When a person has their super power named and acknowledged, they feel seen and validated, and they know that what they bring to the team is irreplaceable. All of a sudden, they are no longer a worker with a set of skills but a hero who can save the day!

A super power isn’t a skill but a perspective, a mindset, a way of working that enhances everything you touch. It’s unique, like a thumbprint, part of your brand. It is that quality that causes others to say, “You know who would be great for this…?” or “We should go to so and so. They would know exactly what to do here.”

People want to know that what they do matters. They want to know that they have something special to contribute. And they want to be seen for the value they bring to the work. When people work from their super power, they find themselves energized, fulfilled and purposeful, all of which increases engagement, sustains energy and inspires people to go above and beyond. By contrast, when people don’t know their super power or feel valued for it, they become just another cog in the wheel.

One of our clients, which has a globally dispersed team, recently named super powers in their entire organization during a one-day offsite. This simple and fun exercise boosted morale, energy and connection between colleagues, and it made a big difference for those who don’t typically get to see each other in person very often.

What could you do for your team? A good starting point is to first see if you can name your own super power. It’s that thing you provide that’s so great. Maybe you’re the one who listens and listens and then neatly summarizes the big idea of the conversation. Or perhaps you’re the one who picks up on what no one is saying but everyone is thinking and feeling. Or maybe you take really complex information and make it digestible for people. Maybe you haven’t ever really noticed your own super power, likely because it’s what you do every day without even thinking about it. You just didn’t know what to call it. But it’s there, and people count on you to engage your super power when it's needed to save the situation.

At your next team meeting, take some time to name the super power of each of your team members. Have every team member share what they see in their colleagues. It’s super uplifting and inspiring.

Here are three questions you can use to help identify your team members’ super powers:

Have fun with this. Our graphics department created comic-like personas for each team member and listed their super powers. Get inspired and make amazing things happen at work!",
"Business coaching is an educational process that significantly enhances the economic achievement of individuals. It concentrates on helping people – especially entrepreneurs – substantially grow their businesses.

According to Heather Hansen O'Neill, president of Find Your Fire and author of bestselling books Teams on Fire! and Find Your Fire, “Today, driven entrepreneurs possess more potential to excel. Meanwhile, many of them are not coming close to realizing their full potential. Business coaching can help entrepreneurs break through barriers that are holding them back and focus on the actions necessary to achieve their goals. In addition, many business owners now have tremendous interest in investing in coaching for their leadership teams to improve the performance of everyone at their companies resulting in greater synergistic success.”

It is clear that a great percentage of entrepreneurs are looking for ways to ratchet up the performance of their businesses. “Based on our survey of 759 entrepreneurs, almost one out of six of them are turning to business coaches to become more professionally capable,” says John Bowen, co-founder of BSW Inner Circle and co-author of Reaching for the Stars: How to Fast-Track Your Business Success by Leveraging Mastermind and CEO Groups. “For some entrepreneurs and accomplished individuals, business coaching is just what they need to generate greater achievements.”

Without question, the demand for business coaching is extensive and growing very quickly. The opportunities for high-caliber business coaches of all stripes are probably better than ever. This leads to business coaches being able to charge respectfully more for their expertise.

Because of the increasing demand for business coaches, more professionals are becoming them. For those capable of coaching, the key issue therefore becomes cultivating a substantial high-quality clientele.

“We’ve found that accomplished entrepreneurs turn to business coaches for a number of specific reasons and decisions. Topping the list is when the selected coach can show how his or her assistance translates into greater company and personal financial success,” says Bowen. “By explicitly and precisely explaining the processes and methodologies a business coach uses and how these approaches produce results, the coach’s practice grows quickly. It’s all a matter of connecting the dots for the entrepreneurs.”

A number of proven business development strategies can enable business coaches to create pipelines of new, motivated clients willing to pay a premium for their services. By utilizing some of these approaches, business coaches are able to build significant and highly profitable business themselves.",
"Taylor Swift stopped the internet in its tracks on Sunday evening when she broke her abstention from politics in an instagram post to her 112 million followers. Though previously ""reluctant"" to discuss politics, she explained that due to events in her life and in the world over the past two years, her feelings have changed.

""I always have and always will cast my vote based on which candidate will protect and fight for the human rights I believe we all deserve in this country. I believe in the fight for LGBTQ rights, and that any form of discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender is WRONG. I believe that the systemic racism we still see in this country towards people of color is terrifying, sickening and prevalent. 

 I cannot vote for someone who will not be willing to fight for dignity for ALL Americans, no matter their skin color, gender or who they love.""

Swift then addressed her concerns over Tennessee Senator Marsha Blackburn, and how her voting record terrifies her. She lists Blackburn's opposition to equal pay for women, her vote against the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act and LGBTQ marriage and rights. ""These are not MY Tennessee values,"" writes Swift, and she went on to say she would be voting for Phil Breseden for Senate and Jim Cooper for the House of Representatives. She expressly addressed fans who have turned 18 since the presidential election, urging them to register, to research the candidates, and to vote even if they d0 not agree with a candidate on every issue.

Her post was intentionally timed before the voter registration deadline in Tennessee, but it's difficult to ignore Swift's own sexual assault and lawsuit, considering her post came the day after Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed to the Supreme Court in spite of sexual assault allegations, and who was nominated by a President who has been accused of sexual misconduct by 13 women. Though Swift mentions neither man by name, knowing how thoughtful and intentional Swift is in all facets of her career, the timing of this post is also a statement in and of itself.

In the first 24 Swift's post went live, Vote.org told Buzzfeed 65,000 people registered to vote. And 48 hours later more than 240,000 people registered. For context, 190,178 voters registered in the month of September, and 56,669 registered in the month of August. In other words, the Taylor Swift voter registration spike is real.

Tuesday night Swift won Artist of the Year at the American Music Awards, and she concluded her acceptance speech with,  “This award and every single award given out tonight were voted on by the people, and you know what else is voted on by the people is the midterm elections on Nov. 6. Get out and vote. I love you guys!”",
"If you're looking to take the next step in your entrepreneurial growth, one of the best investments you can make is in a business coach. Whether you want to increase your sales or improve your hiring strategy, this person can act as an invaluable resource.



Like any professional relationship, you'll want to find a coach with whom you feel a strong connection and rapport. More importantly, you should seek out someone who understands the industry you're in and the unique challenges you're facing. If you're in the market for a business coach, follow these tips from eight seasoned entrepreneurs.

Consider virtual coaches as well as local ones.

A local coach you can meet with face to face may sound like the best approach, but it can be restrictive when it comes to scheduling, according to Blair Thomas, co-founder of eMerchantBroker. ""By finding a coach that is available online, such as via video conferencing, you are opening yourself up to a wider pool of individuals,"" he says.

""Video conferencing can be just as energetic and beneficial as meeting face to face,"" Thomas notes. As well, when you are not bound by location, you can find a coach who specializes in a certain industry or has some other attribute that works best for your needs.

Make sure you feel comfortable opening up.

""Feeling vulnerable and comfortable with your coach will help you establish a real connection, where you can feel good about being brutally honest about your fears,"" she says. ""I have worked with a phenomenal business coach who helped me level up by pushing me hard and providing support.""

Ask for details about how they work.

Anyone can call themselves a business coach. That's why Vik Patel, CEO of Future Hosting, recommends finding out some details about the coach's process, their past successes and their industry experience before hiring them.

""Get specific,"" he advises. ""The job title 'business coach' covers a lot of ground, and you need to be sure that your aims for your business match with the coach's skill set and processes.""

Find someone who shares your long-term vision.

""It helps to make sure that every decision you are trying to make is aligned with your end goal,"" says Desai. ""Start with discussing how they would approach your current situation to see if there is true alignment.""

Look at their track record.

""Knowing what to do and doing what must be done are two very different things,"" he explains. ""A coach who eats their own dog food will understand the little nuisances and how to deal with them when life gets in the way.""

To truly learn from someone, you want to know that they've experienced a similar path of development as you have, and that they'll understand the specific areas in which you need support, says Stanley Meytin, CEO of True Film Production

""A coach who has been where you are can give personal advice on how to thrive moving forward and won't waste time trying to understand you,"" he adds.

"Whoever replaces Elon Musk will need to have a unique combination of leadership skills and work experience. Musk agreed to step down from the chairman role as part of his settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission after facing charges of misleading investors by tweeting that he had ""funding secured"" to take Tesla private at $420 per share. He will remain as CEO and retain a seat on the board, but he's barred from the chairman role for three years. The SEC deal calls for the appointment of new chairperson and two additional directors to the board.

Here are the three things Tesla will look for in Musk's replacement, as noted by Bloomberg.

The new chairperson needs to maintain a level of independence from Musk that is hard to find on Tesla's existing board, as only three of nine board members have no connections to or investments in companies controlled by Musk, Bloomberg reports. Some institutional investors believe the current board has failed to rein in Musk, particularly his Twitter habit, which attracted the SEC charges in the first place. Musk even taunted the SEC on Twitter as recently as last week.

The new chairperson will also need to have a strong managerial track record that the board can expect to help put Tesla on the path to profitability, Bloomberg reports. The company is experiencing significant delays in delivering Model 3 vehicles, even turning to loyal Tesla customers last month to serve as volunteers in delivery centers to help move things along.

Ideally, Tesla will find a candidate who not only has manufacturing experience but has also dealt with regulators in previous positions, according to Bloomberg. While the SEC is likely to keep a close eye on Telsa and Musk for the foreseeable future, Tesla will also need to work with transportation regulators as the company strives to put self-driving cars on the road. Whoever lands the top spot on the board will need to be able to navigate those regulatory issues.

Tesla's settlement with the SEC has not yet been approved. A U.S. district judge will review the settlement on October 11.",
"I work in a very busy legal department in a non-attorney role. Too often I have observed that when a new process or other change is announced at a meeting, lots of people join in to agree with the change. The general counsel will say, ""We are instituting a new process to facilitate X because blah, blah, blah."" Then four or five people in the meeting will jump in and expand on why this idea is such a good one. It's the same idea when management decides not to pursue something. ""We are not doing Y because of blah, blah, blah."" ""Good!! It's a bad idea because of this!!"" ""And that!"" ""And the other!""

Several of these people are on the management team and would have been included in the discussions leading up to the decision. I can understand a question asking why management decided to do X instead of Y, but is there a reason I need to hear six reasons why something is a good idea in addition to the two reasons provided by the general counsel in his original comments?

People complain about how many meetings we have and how long they last, and then they keep talking in the meetings. I speak up when I have a question but other than that, I keep quiet.

I'm at the bottom of the food chain, so I'm not asking for help in managing how the general counsel runs a meeting. I'm asking for a different perspective so that maybe I can get onboard with the idea that saying a good idea is a good idea multiple times is a valuable way to spend time.

Or -- less likely but still possible -- this sort of discussion is actually contributing something that's both worthwhile and intended because part of the purpose of these meetings is to generate buy-in and/or to hear people's reactions to these decisions. That's less likely, since you note that some of the culprits are people who were part of making these decisions, but it's possible and worth considering, especially since you might not be well-positioned to see that as clearly from your vantage point.

1. They're using meetings for announcements. Meetings shouldn't generally be used for announcements; they should be used for things that require discussion (or for things that are sensitive enough that they require meeting in person). If they're announcing things there because they think people may have questions about a new policy or process, that's fine -- but then that brings us to the next point:

2. They need to set better meeting norms. That could mean laying out clear time limits for each topic at the outset (either in an agenda or verbally at the start of the meeting -- ""we're going to spend two minutes on some quick announcements and then move into discussing X..."" or even just ""I want to keep this brief because I know everyone is busy""), or it could mean saying something like, ""We have a lot to get through, so I'm going to ask that people hold questions and comments until we've run through these first three items."" It could even mean that the person leading the meeting says at the start, ""We've traditionally had a lot of people chiming in with their opinions on decisions. If you feel strongly about something, please raise it, but otherwise I want to be sensitive to people's time and try to hold this to X minutes.""

It's important to navigate that carefully though, because you don't want to suppress useful input or make people feel like you don't want to hear their input, as bad things will come of that over the long-term. There's a balance to getting this right; if you go overboard in either direction, it tends to have a disruptive effect.

3. And they probably need to change their norms around how often people are meeting and how long meetings last. If people are complaining about spending too much time in meetings and a large chunk of meeting time is taken up by people talking aimlessly, they need an organization-wide commitment to cutting the amount of time meetings take up. The only real way to do that is with visible commitment from the top, and the organization's leaders need to model better meeting habits themselves to show that they mean it, since people will follow their cues.",productivity
"The two elements that define the term “deleveraging” are: stop borrowing and pay off what you owe as soon as possible.

During the period I call “The Lost Decade” – 2009-2016 – this practice was an essential survival fundamental for millions of small businesses. Indeed, across Main Street America, survey after survey since 2009 revealed small business owners reporting emphatically that they neither wanted nor needed a business loan.

Even during the past two years, as economic expansion has finally taken hold, polling has indicated most small businesses have funded growth with their own retained earnings which, by definition, is a product of deleveraging. But as the economy continues to grow, organic capital eventually runs out. And if you’re going to take advantage of sustained expansion opportunity, funding for most small businesses means, ultimately, a bank loan.

The good news is banks are standing by, ready to lend. Especially community banks, of which I’m an unapologetic, unabashed champion. The other news is that since it’s probably been a while since you’ve approached a bank for a loan, it’s probably time to brush up on some of the fundamentals of having a successful banking relationship.

Consequently, I’m going to help you get back up to speed on six key questions you need to answer. We’ll cover three this week and the rest next week.

You have the right to ask who is going to make the decision on your loan. Can your loan officer decide, or will it go to the local loan committee or somewhere else? Why do you care? The more people involved in the loan approval process increases the scrutiny of your deal, which means more questions and more time to get an answer to your loan request. In the latter case, budget more time and more patience.

2. What do they need?

Your banker will ask for personal and business financial information. They might accept last year’s business numbers, but they could also ask for interim financial records: balance sheet and operating statement (aka, profit and loss statement). They’ll also want to see a projection showing how your plan to pay the money back will impact your cash flow. Depending on the size of your request and what you’re using the money for, they may ask for a business plan. If the loan is for real estate, a current appraisal will be required.

Don’t give the bank more than they ask for, but give them everything they ask for. Remember, the quicker your banker gets the information, the quicker you’ll get an answer.

3. How do they want it?

Ask your banker what information can be presented verbally and what needs to be in writing, whether hard copy or electronic. Whether you’re borrowing $5000 for a computer, or $5 million to buy out a competitor, knowing as much as you can about the loan approval process will significantly improve your chances of not only getting a quick answer, but also getting an approval.

Finally, the title of the shortest book in the world is, “Loan Officer Courage.” But you can give your banker courage with responsive communication and proper information.

Next time, Part 2: What Motivates Your Banker?

Write this on a rock … Don’t just borrow money from your bank – make your bank your business’s best friend.",None
"Mistakes are sometimes unavoidable in the workplace, even from the most capable employees. While mistakes can be frustrating, it is important for company leadership to embrace learning opportunities that may come from them. Failure can give employees the chance to learn where they went wrong and adapt their approach moving forward.

Cultivating a workplace that embraces failure can be difficult, but it is vital to success. Employees who fear making mistakes may be less likely to take risks or express opinions, leading to a lack of innovation, and good ideas going unheard. Feeling that a slip-up or failed initiative may result in punishment, rather than an opportunity to grow, can cause hesitancy among staff.

Here are a few ways business leaders can encourage workers to be less afraid of failure and turn an occasional mistake into a learning opportunity.

Company culture often stems from the top of the organization. When encouraging staff to take chances, leaders should consider sharing their own mistakes or learning experiences. Employees of all levels may feel comforted to learn that senior management has also faced comparable challenges in their own careers.

Equally as important, leadership should discuss how they responded to these setbacks to illustrate how these events can be stepping stones to greater growth. These discussions can be informal anecdotes or consist of more structured conversations, but they should be open and honest.

When leaders demonstrate that they have also overcome challenges, employees may feel empowered to take more thoughtful risks in their work.

When the inevitable occurs and mistakes are made, managers should be mindful of their immediate responses and avoid responding with anger or frustration, as neither is typically conducive to positive growth. Instead, address the situation calmly, and work closely with employees to find solutions, acknowledging their role in the situation but supporting them throughout the resolution process.

After any immediate issues are handled, supervisors should schedule one-on-one meetings with the employees to discuss how to avoid similar problems in the future. This approach may encourage employees to pause and reflect on key takeaways, setting them up for success moving forward.

During the recruitment process, companies may focus all efforts on finding the perfect candidate – one with ample experience, a glowing list of qualifications and a perfect career trajectory. While these applicants may seem like great fits, the most successful hires are sometimes the most nontraditional applicants. These candidates may meet the basic requirements but could lack higher levels of experience or qualifications due to adversity earlier in their careers. While some may not consider this a positive when searching for an ideal candidate, the professional challenges that these individuals have overcome may be strong indications of mature, persistent and committed workers.

To identify these candidates, during the interview process, recruiters may consider asking a potential employee to share an example of a professional misstep and how they overcame it. Their response may reveal how the candidates will manage risks, handle failure and grow from mistakes.

Fostering a workplace environment that views failure as a learning opportunity can have significant positive effects for a company. When employees feel supported, they are often more likely to share innovative ideas, give candid feedback to managers and take on new projects and initiatives, turning mistakes into positive growth opportunities for the employee and the company overall.",coaching
"""How can a mother or father prevent their teenage son from someday being accused of sexual assault?” The Washington Post asked in a recent article stating that “parents across the country have been wrestling with the anxieties of raising teenage boys to understand consent"" in the wake of the Kavanaugh hearing.

Parents have an important role to play but so do America’s schools. A recent analysis of state sex education standards by the Center for American Progress’s shows that there is a lot of room for growth.

Many students don’t have access to sex education at all. According to CAP, more than half of states don’t even have sex education standards. Of those that do, fewer than half have standards that carry the force of law. Some states require sex education but their requirements are vague, not broken down by age group, and/or don’t touch on healthy relationships, sexual assault or consent. Finally, some states still allow or require misleading, inaccurate, or incomplete information or approaches that have been debunked by research.

To be clear, these are sensitive issues. Parents and community leaders differ in how they would like to approach these topics. Many parents oppose discussing consent because they believe it is tantamount to giving young people permission to have sex.

But even in conservative states, progress is possible. In March, Georgia enacted legislation requiring students to be taught age-appropriate sexual abuse and assault awareness and prevention education in kindergarten through grade 9. That same month, the Oklahoma House passed “Lauren’s Law,” which would require students to be educated about consent. West Virginia, one of the reddest states in the nation age-appropriate statewide sex education standards that are among the nation’s most detailed.

Arizona recently considered legislation to “help pupils develop the relationships and communication skills to form healthy relationships throughout their lives that are based on mutual respect and affection and free from violence, coercion and intimidation.” Even in Idaho, legislation was introduced to require districts teaching sex ed to include a discussion of healthy relationships, though that sentence was struck before the bill advanced out of committee.

Conversely, some of the bluest states in the country have struggled to embrace comprehensive sex education. Maryland took two tries to enact a law requiring students to be taught about consent. Similar bills failed to be enacted in Virginia and in Massachusetts, which hasn’t updated its health education standards since 1999.

As a result, the norm, which transcends ideology, is sex education standards that fail to prepare young people for the tensions and challenges they will inevitably encounter in their sexual relationships. States can do better, and students are leading the way. Lauren Atkins, a high school student from Norman, Oklahoma, wrote about her sexual assault and then helped draft legislation to prevent a similar thing from happening to other girls. “The 18-year-old got involved because she believes that consent education could have drastically changed that night for her. ‘I really don’t think he did this to be a terrible human being,’” she said. “He didn’t know that this wasn’t allowed.’” And Maryland middle schooler Maeve Sanford-Kelly channeled her feeling of powerlessness into action to improve sex education for all of Maryland’s teens. Both young girls saw education as a powerful intervention to prevent sexual assault.

Expectations around asking for and receiving affirmative consent in intimate relationships have changed, and that is a very positive development for society. But just as we wouldn’t expect students to learn the rules of algebra on their own, students deserve clarity – delivered sensitively – when it comes to consent. Our laws and policies should honor and respect both parents’ and communities’ values. But they should be grounded in reality, or our daughters and sons will pay a steep price.",
"Recently, I have heard more and more new clients mention that their leadership development efforts are not working. People just aren’t changing.

Don’t get me wrong - I am entirely on-board with leadership development. But you can only lead the horse to water; you can’t make him drink. What I do believe is that we, as the manager and the employee, are the ones most responsible for holding ourselves accountable to obtaining the fullest potential of what we learn.

As a leader of people, we send our employees to leadership training with the hopes of one of two things:

As employees we take leadership training for different reasons:

Both perspectives (manager and employee) are right. However, expectations on the results from the training will be missed the majority of the time. That is clear from the statistics I mentioned above.

What I have found from these missed expectations are two elements absent from both the manager and the employee.

When both the manager and employee align with these missing elements, growth is exponential and unlimited.

Let me give you a personal example.

I had a manager a few years back that fell into the “unwanted behaviors” category where their team’s productivity, morale, and turnover were high. After enrolling him in the same Emotional Intelligence training twice, he finally agreed to attend the third time. He accepted he needed to go but didn’t “believe” he needed to go.

Even after attending and receiving the 360-degree feedback that all aligned with the same behaviors that I had seen, he still didn’t want to believe he had a problem. He continued to accept that he needed to make a change, but he refused to believe it. He saw the evidence and had excuses every time we would discuss the progress we hoped he would make.

In this case, pride was a blind-spot for the employee. In the end, the unchanged behaviors for this employee led him to be in a position where he did not like the outcome.

Leadership development is critical and will be powerful for only the willing participants. Expectations drive belief, belief drives behavior, and behavior drives action. Meaning, when you increase the expectation of your willingness to learn, your belief in yourself will change your behavior, and when you change your behavior, you will change your actions. When you reach this level of awareness, the teacher appears, and you will learn.

"Have you met many true leaders in your professional experiences? What made them world-class leadership material? There's no wrong answer — but it might've been their magnetic influence on the culture of their company and the people there.

But how do they actually pull that off? Here are ten ways real leaders leave their company's organizational culture stronger than they found it.

There's a lot of wisdom in a phrase such as, ""Listen much and speak little."" It's one of the primary hallmarks of a real leader. They're observant enough to take in even the subtlest details about their work environment, including employee behavior, concerns about morale and opportunities to make improvements in company processes.

We were all in high school once. And once we break into the professional world, it's hard to shake the tendency to make fast friends and divide ourselves into smaller groups, or subcultures, within the larger whole. The best leaders see team-building opportunities in these subcultures — but they also know to encourage more inter-team cooperation and improved information sharing.

Some of the most harmonious companies out there are the ones where the company hierarchy seems to recede into the background. Compare this with an overbearing manager who throws their weight around or looks for ways to place themselves above the rank-and-file. Truly great managers understand the value of a flatter company structure and the benefit of fielding suggestions and feedback from people who don't have a powerful-sounding title pasted into their email signature.

If there's value in an anointed leader who doesn't retreat behind their title, there's just as much value in an employee who simply exudes respectful leadership as a matter of course. Maybe it's leadership they've obtained through continued education. Or perhaps it's just the ability to listen to and empathize with their fellow workers. Either way, leadership doesn't always require a title.

We sometimes forget that there's more to us than our careers. Sometimes leadership in the workplace gets defined in part by what goes on beyond its walls. By this, we mean leaders who take an interest in the role they play in their community, their state and even the world.

Civic involvement and the charitable giving of time and money is something every leader should aspire to if they're serious about their company maintaining a pro-social place in society. And it's a great way to inspire a new generation of civic participants.

There can be a disconnect between the stated objectives of a company and the day-to-day realities of the people who work there. Sometimes it takes a gifted leader to help employees connect the dots and find meaning and value in what they do. It starts by taking a look at the company's values.

Is your focus thoughtful product design? Unimpeachable customer service? Whatever the objective, leaders need to know how to help every employee, no matter their role, and understand how the work they do positively impacts the broader mission.

Leaders can work with employees to expand their working knowledge of their field, broaden their skill sets, and add new challenges and responsibilities to the work they're doing. Maybe it's even a matter of cross-training multiple employees so they can glide between departments as needed for a fresh challenge and a renewed sense of connection with the larger company.

There are many opportunities throughout life for us to learn the value of accountability. The workplace is, of course, one of the most obvious.

Leaders can work in a variety of ways to reinforce process ownership and accountability in their organization. Which metrics are worth measuring and discussing with employees? What are the most useful benchmarks and goals to pursue? Are there expectations for transparency or productivity that aren't being respected? When leaders reinforce accountability in the workplace, they reinforce accountability everywhere.

The idea of leadership exists because we need people with vision who can get things done. But isn't the workplace far more than how many widgets we make in an hour or how many dollars we've earned?

One of your most important jobs as a leader is to encourage results without making your teams feel like spokes in a wheel or gears in a profit making machine. Where's the heart? What's the point of any of the work you do if you're not having fun and developing more positive relationships with the people you spend time with every day?

It's certainly true that everybody has a different communication style and uses language differently. But something every leader has to bear in mind is that it's 100 percent obvious when a leader is talking down to an employee or talking over their head.

High-quality leaders command solid vocabularies and have a good grasp of supportive language and constructive criticism. But think beyond the work, too. If you're a leader, do you smile as you pass someone in the hall? Are you, in a sense, ""emotionally available"" when your team has grievances to air, suggestions to make or simply idle chitchat to exchange?

If there's one thing you remember from this list, make it the importance of communication. People look to leaders who sound genuine and exude enthusiasm about engaging with their employees. A true leader will always show their colors no matter the circumstances.",wellness
"If you want to reach those in Generation Z, you have to learn about their world.

For American youth, social media influencers aren’t just trendsetters in a traditional sense, they’re peers. Consider the digital proximity they share. In a feed, influencer posts mix seamlessly with posts by friends. Gen Zers often see influencers’ updates on a daily basis and may turn to them for inspiration. Influencers are able to be hyper-present in their lives, especially since 45% of teens are “almost constantly” online.

In a saturated content environment with growing concerns about user privacy, influencers can be a marketer’s ticket to visibility and trust. So, where does one start?

Based on my experience working for a company that offers influencer marketing tools and services, here are four trends I’ve identified for reaching Gen Z right where they’re at.

1. Get familiar with new platforms like TikTok.

What is TikTok? Marketers had a hard time understanding Musical.ly even when it had 200 million users in 2017. Now that it’s been acquired by the platform TikTok, the app is surprisingly still unexploited. Somewhere between Vine and Snapchat, TikTok allows users to record short (15-second) videos of them dancing, lip-synching, playing with filters and more. And it’s caught on fast: TikTok was the Apple app store’s most downloaded non-game app in the first quarter of 2018.

Adapting to new content formats can be difficult, which is why letting a native influencer do it for your brand is a safe bet. There’s never been a better time, in my opinion. I expect the influencers of TikTok will become the stars of tomorrow, much like former Vine influencers, such as Lele Pons and Cameron Dallas.

How to work with these new influencers:

• Make your marketing campaign a game. So-called “challenges” are viral trends that inspire users to make videos following a defined format, such as the ice bucket challenge. Incite a wave of user-generated content by working with influencers to launch a branded challenge. That’s exactly what the German skincare company, Beiersdorf, did when promoting its new perfumes on Musical.ly.

• Let them be the creative directors. It’s hard to relinquish control, but influencers are influential because they know their platforms. Let them make creative decisions: The content will be more effective, and they’ll be happy to work with you again.

• Funnel traffic to other channels. One downside to emerging platforms is that they typically have poor analytics. Bypass this by creating a “brand awareness” campaign, channeling new followers to your other accounts, before you begin the real advertising.

• Know your audience. Remember to respect the nuances of this generation. While Gen Z includes anyone born after 1995, not all of them use the same apps. Musical.ly is recognized as popular among tweens, while older Gen Zers often prefer apps like Instagram.

2. Get into gaming before it’s too late.

Remember that part about “most downloaded non-game app”? Video games are a Gen Z trend you don’t want to ignore. A 2018 Pew study found that “97% of teen boys play video games in some form or fashion.” Girls are not far behind -- the same study reports that 83% of teen girls play video games, as well.

This explains the growing popularity of streaming networks like Twitch, where users watch others play video games live. And according to a 2017 report on game video content (GVC), “More people watch GVC than HBO, Netflix, ESPN and Hulu combined.”

This is a huge opportunity for brands. In a previous article, we discussed ways to work with influential gamers -- the top strategies being giveaways, promotional codes and logo displays.

MCNs are companies that group different YouTube influencers: to film in shared studios, to cross their audiences and to maximize their advertising power under the wings of a single entity -- the network.

In terms of reaching Gen Zers, MCNs allow brands to monopolize certain niches. Take, for example, the MCN Machinima, which advertises access to “massive, multichannel distribution” in the e-gaming niche.

This is an organized approach to working with YouTube influencers that should not be overlooked, simply because the channel is indispensable for reaching Gen Z audiences. One survey, of 1,452 teens between the ages of 13-20, conducted by Defy Media for Adweek, found that 50% claimed they “can’t live without” YouTube.

Instagram is practically designed for influencer marketing with its easy discoverability, integrated analytics, shopping tags and mobile-first design. Indeed, the market value of Instagram influence is expected to nearly double in the coming year, exceeding 2.3 billion dollars by 2019, according to Statista (subscription required).

In many ways, Instagram influencers are the voice of Generation Z. They use storytelling and microblogging to capture the values held by the demographic. Marketers can tap into this culture by working with influencers who represent their core beliefs -- authenticity, diversity and advocacy being some of the major values defined in Refinery29’s “The Z list.”

As one might expect, authenticity in partnerships is of great importance to Gen Z consumers. In practice, marketers would do best to favor long-term relationships with influencers based on mutual values. Not only does compatibility minimize the risk of a post looking forced, but it’s also necessary for content creators who, often, are building their own brands themselves. In short: Treat them like the public relations (PR) professional they are for best results.

Learn more about developing the right influencer value propositions in my previous article.

In the U.S., this new generation constitutes the largest portion of the population at 26.54% (subscription required) and will only continue to grow in purchasing power as they enter the workforce. While current trends may pass, I believe one thing is certain: Gen Z will maintain a close relationship with digital influencers. Marketers can stay on top of their campaigns by continuing to study this relationship, as it evolves across new platforms and pastimes.",
"A good salesperson is hard to find. It can be even more difficult to assess just which elements make some salespeople shine above others. Ultimately, though, finding and building a team of the right sales associates is crucial to business success. After all, they are often the first contact a possible customer has with your company.

Below, six members of Young Entrepreneur Council highlight some of the key traits every business person should look for in potential sales team members.

1. Tenacity, Drive And Not Taking 'No' For An Answer

The top three traits I've seen in great salespeople are tenacity, drive and the ability to work through a ""no."" Great salespeople realize that success will not simply happen for them -- they need to make it happen with a no-quit attitude and a desire to win. Sending helpful content and being personable with clients are pay-to-play traits; what makes someone stand out is their ability to understand where a ""no"" is coming from and combat it with expertise and grace. Our top-performing salesperson month after month is the first female we hired for the team and she truly stands out from the crowd. She's consistent with following proper processes, tenacious when it comes to closing the deal and never takes ""no"" for an answer. - Suneera Madhani, Fattmerchant

The best salesperson is not the one who knows your product best -- that's the baseline. It's the person who knows how to uncover a potential client's problem with swiftness, ease and clarity. Often, a client can give you a general idea of their pain point, but it becomes your job to dig into what issues are surrounding their pain points, how your product is the best solution and how your company is the best partner in getting to that solution. Good salespeople do not rely on the client to give them their exact needs; they use the information provided to get an idea of the bigger picture and show how your product will be indispensable. - Benish Shah, Raised Real

The best salespeople are true educators. They don't tell someone what they need; they explain why they need it. If your product is great, you should believe it and be able to convey that to your customers, as well as the individuals you're training. As entrepreneurs, we automatically have a passionate attachment to our products and services, and passing that off to another person can be daunting. When training a new salesperson to take on this crucial role, it's important for them to understand why they should care about what they're selling. If you can convey the ""why"" to them in an effective way, they can pass that on to the customer and represent your brand effectively. - Annie Eaton, Futurus

We've heard since childhood that honesty is the best policy and I truly believe this is a self-evident truth. My sales team is taught to be honest, build trust and ensure we are doing what is best for the client -- even if that means we don't make the sale that day. While our company is an IT consulting company, it is clear that we need human connection to build honest and true relationships with our clients. If we build a solid relationship based on honesty and trust, then when the need does arise for our support we will be given the opportunity to shine instead of others. - Amber Lowry, Syssero

The two most important traits that an effective salesperson must have are being personable and relatable. As an entrepreneur who has to pitch and sell new clients every once in a while, I try to convey a pleasant personality, while also being relatable to build rapport and trust. Without either of those traits, it's difficult to build trust with others. - Kristin Kimberly Marquet, Creative Development Agency, LLC

To me, a winning salesperson identifies someone's need and communicates the benefits of our products and services in the context of that need. Simple! However, no two clients are the same so emotional intelligence, fluidity and creative thinking are a must. We want to see salespeople adapt to the situation and use our sales presentations as guidelines, not scripts. This famous Bruce Lee quote helps keep everyone focused: ""You must be shapeless, formless, like water. When you pour water in a cup, it becomes the cup."" - Leyda Hernandez, C'est Du Luxe",None
"Throughout my years as a therapist I've worked with a lot of clients who thought they were setting themselves up to become mentally stronger. But rather than create an environment that helped them build more mental muscle, many of them were actually creating circumstances that were draining their mental strength.

I worked with a man who had read articles about high achievers who get up at the crack of dawn. So he began forcing himself to get out of bed at 4 AM every day. He thought being an early riser would turn him into a productive force to be reckoned with.

Or, there was a woman I worked with who was working over 70 hours a week at a job she disliked. She depended on caffeine and fast food to get through the day and her stress level was always through the roof.

She felt distracted much of the time, which weighed heavily on her productivity. So she had to work longer days to get her work done and the more hours she worked, the more distracted she felt. It led to a vicious cycle that was hard to break and she blamed herself for not being strong enough to handle everything.

While both of these individuals were intent on establishing a routine that reflected self-discipline, their habits weren't helping them develop the mental muscle they needed to become their best. They'd fallen prey to a lot of misconceptions about mental strength and their efforts were backfiring.

Becoming mentally stronger doesn't require you to inflict pain and suffering on yourself only to then blame yourself for not being able to hack it. Instead, create an environment that is conducive to building mental muscle. Here are 10 ways to structure your life so you can become mentally stronger:

You might think surrounding yourself with cupcakes and being able to resist them when you're on a diet is the hallmark of mental strength. But willpower is a finite resource no matter how strong you are.

When you spend all your time trying to resist a temptation right in front of you, you won't have energy leftover to reach new goals. So rather than insist you should be self-disciplined all th time, remove temptations from your life so you can devote your energy to more worthwhile causes.

You don't need to treat your body like a machine or push yourself to your limits just to prove how far you can go. Sometimes, being strong is about being OK with who you are even if you don't finish the race, accept a dare, or go to extremes. Create healthy habits that stem from your desire to do better rather than punish yourself for not being good enough.

3. Keep your eyes on your own journey.

Life isn't a competition to see who can earn the most money or look the happiest on social media. Just because someone else has a stricter diet, gets more exercise, or works more hours, doesn't mean they're stronger than you. Keep your eyes on your journey.

4. Set yourself up for success.

5. Take care of yourself.

You have to take care of your body and your mind if you want to be your best. Your sleeping habits, diet, and exercise routine play a major role in how well your mind functions. Take care of yourself if you want your mental strength exercises to be effective.

Whether you call yourself names or you struggle to manage your anger, acknowledge your cognitive, emotional, and behavioral weaknesses. Recognizing your weaknesses, however, shouldn't be about putting yourself down. Instead, identifying areas that need improvement can help you figure out how to develop a daily schedule that will help you succeed.

7. Ask for help when you need it.

Whether you need to ask your boss for help dealing with an unruly co-worker or you need to ask your doctor for help dealing with your anxiety, asking for help can be tough to do. But it can prevent you from wasting your time and energy on an issue that you can't seem to resolve on your own.",None
"Everyone’s got it figured out…but you.

If you’ve ever heard a little voice inside your head pointing out your every mistake, critiquing your every move, berating you each time you didn’t nail it or fell short of your ideal (unlike ‘everyone else’ who seem to glide along effortlessly), then you’ll know how constant, critical and discouraging that voice can be.

Let’s face it, if there’s one thing many of us are good at, it is beating up on ourselves. Despite how kind we can be to those around us in difficult moments, many people can be outright cruel to themselves. Our innate negativity bias drives us to attend far more to our failures and dwell on our deficiencies. And when we do nail the presentation, win the prize and get it right, we quickly downplay or pass over those successes with only a fleeting celebratory moment before our attention is pulled back to what we have yet to do or could still do that bit better. It’s a vicious, self-diminishing-cycle.

Of course, compassion, which is defined by our sensitivity to the experience of suffering and our desire to alleviate it, is a virtue we all admire. Yet research shows that many people – particularly women – find it far easier to extend compassion toward others than toward themselves.

Dr. Kristin Neff, a professor at the University of Texas, Austin and the author of Self Compassion, has spent over a decade studying self-compassion. In our interview for my Live Brave podcast, she shared with me her theoretical framework for self-compassion which consists of three core components - self-kindness, common humanity, and mindfulness of suffering.

Self-compassion can sound like a ‘feel good’ fluffy way of dealing with disappointments, failures, and mistakes, but a growing body of research has found going easier on yourself is not just the loving thing to do, it's the smart thing to do. Multiple studies have found self-compassion can:

• Deepen interpersonal relationships (self-compassionate people are easier to live and work with)

• Improve positive body-image (warding off the potential for eating disorders)

• Counter rumination (something women are particularly prone toward)

• Foster resilience to bounce back faster from loss and setbacks

Often the executives I work with, many of whom can be pretty tough on themselves, respond cynically so my suggestions to be little kinder on themselves. Their comments run along the lines of:

Surely going easy on myself is self-indulgent? It's setting the bar high and expecting a lot from myself that drives me to work hard and get ahead. Heck, I'd probably turn into a lazy slacker if I stopped being so hard on myself.

The data shows otherwise. In fact, studies have found that people who practice self-compassion are not less motivated to work hard and get ahead, they are more so . Since they don’t measure their self-worth based on the results they achieve, they are more likely to try things and risk failure. They know that if they don’t get the outcome they want, it won’t be the end of the world. Nor will it mean they’ll feel like a loser. Rather, they’ll take the learning and move on, that bit wiser.

Interestingly, research into self-compassion has debunked the once widely-held belief that high self-esteem is the strongest predictor of success. Self-compassion is now regarded as more valuable for wellbeing and performance than self-esteem, from helping students succeed in the classroom to enabling adults to bounce back from setbacks and thrive in life.

One study of students found that those with higher levels of self-compassion were able to handle disappointment more positively and stay more motivated to keep trying after their failures. Accordingly, they were less prone to the performance anxiety that plagues so many young people (and plenty of the not-so-young.)  Because self-compassion circumvents the often-debilitating self-evaluation process, it liberates people to give themselves permission to risk failure more often. This in turn helps them learn more, grow more, and succeed more.

If you’re wondering how you can be more compassionate with yourself, I invite you to start by simply paying attention to how often you aren’t. If your inner critic has permanently set up shop in your head, chances are your self-recriminations have become transparent to you. There are many ways to cultivate self-compassion, including the Mindful Self Compassion program created by Neff and Chris Germer.

As someone with a well-entrenched habit of focusing on my flaws and shortcomings, I have become better at catching myself in self-critical moments (there are plenty to catch!). When I do, I ask myself what a close friend or loving God would say to me in that moment. Then I say that to myself…out loud when I can. I get that it sounds a little woo-woo, but I invite you to try it. Then notice how it shifts how you’re feeling, however subtly.

The truth is that we are all ‘human becomings’ – fallible, flawed, and wired to dwell more on our shortcomings and failings than we are to celebrate our strengths and successes. As I share in my Live Brave podcast with Kristin Neff, it is by embracing our humanity – for all that we are and for all that we aren’t – that we can savor more moments of gratitude, joy, and connection over the course of an ordinary day. We can also spare ourselves the needless suffering that comes from feeling isolated, inadequate and unworthy.

As author Jack Kornfield wrote, “If your compassion doesn’t include yourself, it is incomplete.”",
"This past June, the world was dealt two blows, when iconic entrepreneurs Kate Spade and Anthony Bourdain took their own lives. Here we are four months later on World Mental Health Day, and while there seems to be a rise in global conversations about mental health and collective steps being taken to remove the stigma surrounding the disease, there is still a lot more work to be done.

According to the Anxiety & Depression Association of America (ADAA), approximately 40 million Americans suffer from anxiety. In addition, a study by the ADAA indicates that 16.1 million Americans suffer from Major Depression.

Given the headlines and statistics (women are diagnosed twice as often as men), we're also starting to pay much closer attention to the emotional and psychological toll entrepreneurship takes on female founders.

I spoke with Dr. Lauren Hazzouri, psychologist and champion for girls and women, speaker, and founder of Hazzouri Psychology, about some of the lifestyle changes that female entrepreneurs can make to help ease some of the feelings of anxiety and depression — and what we can do collectively, to help each other.

Before we dive in, here's a disclaimer from Hazzouri: “Entrepreneurial lifestyle patterns certainly do not cause mental health concerns, though they may contribute to them. The first action toward emerging — regardless of symptoms and/or diagnosis — is making a change. Remember that our bodies and our brains require daily maintenance. Getting your body working for you rather than against you helps level the playing field, so we can see what remains for us to tackle on the emotional front.""

Hazzouri feels you: “Lifestyle patterns are tough to change, especially when you’re not feeling so great, have no energy, can’t motivate yourself, and can’t get comfortable. I know it’s hard. For many who are suffering, that means establishing a treatment plan with a professional, which may or may not include medication. It also means creating a healthier physical regimen. To feel better long-term, you’re going to have to do things that aren’t comfortable today. At least this discomfort is a means to a better end.”

Exercise regularly: Exercise is important for everyone, but for those with mood concerns and/or anxiety, it’s critical. Research suggests that a 30-minute run gives us the same boost in serotonin levels (the brain chemical that makes you feel good) that we could expect from a low dose of a Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) like Zoloft or Prozac.

Sleep consistently (at least eight hours): Our bodies thrive on the concept of a schedule. Go to sleep every night aiming for at least eight hours of sleep. Get your circadian rhythm working for you, rather than against you (it will help in regards to mood, anxiety, focus, etc.)

Co-work to avoid isolation: “I suggest that entrepreneurs work in community spaces, such as WeWork, The Riveter and The Wing (or a local one in your city). Even without significant engagement with those around us, being in the company of others often feels better than being alone, day in, day out. We need each other to feel good.”

If you’re not ready to join a co-working space, see if there are female entrepreneurs in your network that you can plan “co-working days” with, if only for motivation and human connection IRL.

Take control of your thoughts: Mark down your thoughts, feelings, and the situation or possible triggers. Hazzouri explains: ""Whenever you’re feeling anxious, afraid, uncomfortable, uneasy, or sad, write it down. Each one of us has both a positive and a negative thought voice. The negative voice is the part of you that has internalized all of the warped messages thrown at you by society since birth and works overtime to shame you into fitting in with societal norms. Society fuels self-destructive thoughts. Thoughts lead to feelings, and feelings lead to actions. To change the way you feel (a.k.a., less than), change the way you think. Identify thought patterns that lead to unwanted feelings. Thoughts are not facts, so show your negative thoughts who's boss. Write them down. Replace them with truth. Get on with your day. Remember, each one of us came with everything we need to get through this life in a healthy and happy way.""

Come together & build your tribe: ""Remember, we are better together. You're not alone. When we come together and stand in our power, there’s no stopping us. Reach out to your squad, tribe, coven. Share. Connect. Repeat. ""

Support those conducting mental health research: Hazzouri explains: “It seems that in our well-intentioned outpouring of loss, shock and sadness when a high-profile tragedy involving mental health strikes, we’re projecting what we do know onto that which we don’t. As a result, there’s an influx of people sharing personal stories about experiences with mental health, Facebook shares with offers of everything from open doors, cups of coffee, a shoulder to cry on, and Instagram posts with compassionate nudges to reach out to ‘strong’ friends. It’s a relief to see our society stepping up, having the conversation, and doing the human being thing so well. At the same time, it seems we’re reaching for really simple solutions to complex problems that are hard to understand and still require a lot of research. How about in addition to offering coffee to those friends with a history of depression, we support those conducting mental health research? As a society, we need to put our money where our mouths are this week and for weeks, months and years to come.”

Support entrepreneurs by offering discounted fitness rates: Hazzouri continues: “As a society, we can also offer discounts on gym memberships and sports leagues for entrepreneurs, taking a lead from the education system. For example, when children or adolescents are home schooled, they are encouraged to engage in the extra-curricular sports, arts programs, clubs, and other school activities provided by their home school district. Once we graduate, our human need for connection doesn’t decrease, yet organized opportunities do. So, it’s important for entrepreneurs to integrate being human and being successful, according to society’s standards. This can help decrease the feelings of isolation often felt by entrepreneurs.""

And to the female founder who's unsure about seeking help or treatment, or talking about her struggles, because she fears it might harm her public persona?

Hazzouri offers this: “I can’t imagine compartmentalizing success and well-being. To me, they are one in the same, especially for females. With social norms contributing to our mental health concerns, it’s no surprise that many women struggle with anxiety, depression, and the like. As a woman, a human-being, you deserve to be successful: physically, spiritually, emotionally, intellectually. Showing up means shedding the impact of society and bringing all that you are into all that you do. That’s when true success unfolds.”",None
"As World Mental Health day rolls around again, there’s a lot of reminders about the individual habits that contribute to mental health—exercising, putting your phone down, going to therapy, eating well—and the requisite prompts about reaching out to friends or family who are depressed, and seeking help if you are. These are of course important reminders and worthwhile habits, but the bigger question might be this: Why are so many people are suffering so much in the first place, if not from clinical depression, then from a low-grade sense of unhappiness and emptiness?

If you boil all the components, loneliness might emerge as one of the biggest threats to mental health there is. An increasing amount of research in the last few years has revealed exactly this. For instance, Americans who say they don’t have a single confidant has tripled in the last few decades. And a large-scale study from the Kaiser Family Foundation last month looked at loneliness patterns in the U.S., U.K., and Japan. Two-thirds of people say they have just a few or no friends or relatives nearby to lend support. And two in 10 people said they felt alone much of the time or always.

Another study earlier this year found that about half of Americans reported feeling alone sometimes or always. The numbers are even higher for older people, who may be more likely to live alone, or have spouses and friends who have passed away. The U.K has begun to take the issue somewhat more seriously than we do here in the U.S. The country has an appointed Minister for Loneliness to combat what Theresa May calls the “sad reality of modern life"" for people of all ages.

And it’s true that modern life seems to be chipping away those social connections that are so critical for our mental health. We’re deeply social creatures, and evolved to be so. We lived in groups for many thousands of years—living isolated lives as we do nowadays goes counter to our innate psychological needs. Many people live hundreds or thousands of miles away from their families, and most simply don’t have the same kinds of village as humans evolved to live in, let alone raise kids in.

It's not just adults and older people. Tweens and teens appear also to be feeling this, though perhaps for different reasons from adults. Screens may play a bigger role in their lives, and affect their social lives as least as much. Kids are not only digital natives these days, but social media natives as well. Indeed, a number of studies have found that more time on screens is linked to teen depression and even suicidality, while in-person social interaction is linked to better mental health. This is not particularly surprising, but it is ironic. (And it should be mentioned that in the last year, some of the developers of social media have expressed regret about their role in its creation, and some won’t even let their own kids on it.)

And a complementary body of research had illustrated again and again that having strong social connections is linked not only to happiness over the years, but also to long-term health as we age. Harvard’s well-known longevity study, spanning 80 years, found that social connection appears to be the key variable that’s linked to greater happiness and well-being, as well as a longer life.

So on this World Mental Health day, take some time to think about not just the individual habits you carry out, but also more generally about how your life is structured. Are there things you could do to increase your connection to others in a more global way, like living nearer to relatives or making commitments to your community members or local projects? Thinking not just about the little everyday things, but also the larger questions about how we structure our lives, may be a big part of investing in our own well-being, and that of those around us.",
"Mental illness is a stubborn foe. It affects how we think, feel, and act. Advocates must dispel the perception that depression and related conditions are a private concern that belongs in the shadows. Progressive business leaders understand that mental health is a shared concern and that promoting mental health and overall organizational health are the same fight.

Today is World Mental Health Day which seeks to build awareness and drive education and advocacy. Since its first observed year in 1992, we have made modest progress in raising awareness and in reducing the stigma around mental health issues. A report from the Mental Health in the Workplace Summit held earlier this year confirms how far we have to go.

It is in the best interest for everyone to continue to destigmatize mental illness and to connect affected employees with the comprehensive care they need. Leadership and HR must ensure that employees know how to access that support and care even if they do not wish to disclose an issue with their manager.

Beyond these fundamental steps, business leaders should keep in mind the following four strategies for promoting mental health and building overall organizational health.

A common theme heard from those who battle mental health issues at work is a feeling of powerlessness. When we have what psychologists call an internal “locus of control,” we feel in charge of our destiny. When on the other hand that locus of control is external, we think life is happening to us, and we are passive bystanders.

Fostering a sense of autonomy amongst employees should be a central goal for all business leaders. Employees feel autonomous when they are granted a meaningful role in decision-making, when their input is taken seriously, and when they have the latitude to exercise creativity and independent judgment. Empowered employees are more engaged, productive, and loyal.

Authentic leadership activates a culture of autonomy. Such leaders listen to, engage and trust their employees. They do not micromanage them. Instead, leaders provide parameters, tools, and resources for the project or task at hand and allow employees the freedom of choice—empowering them to determine how to achieve goals. In a culture that actively promotes a sense of autonomy, employees are less likely to fall prey to feelings of powerlessness that spiral into depression and anxiety.

Work-life balance is an overrated concept. Alternatively, most of us are seeking work-life integration. Work and life do not compete with one another. They are part of an integrated whole. Ideally, we must embody the same level of enthusiasm, engagement, and energy across all areas of our life. One of many ways for employers to support their employees is to offer a flexible work policy so that they are better able to manage all aspects of their life with less pressure.

Employers who understand this truth will have an advantage in attracting and retaining top talent. They will also have healthier employees who feel the freedom to meet personal and professional needs without pitting one against the other.

Flexibility in the modern workplace takes many forms. For some, it is the freedom to work flexible hours. For others, it is the ability to work remotely for part of the week. The bottom line is that leaders understand it is not important when and where the work gets done. Employees who are granted the freedom to perform on their terms will pay high dividends on that investment.

After a major two-year study of team performance, Google found that “psychological safety” was by far the most important factor in the formation of effective, cohesive teams. The study defined this safety as a quality that allows team members to “feel safe to take risks and be vulnerable in front of one another.”

Vulnerability may not immediately stand out as a strategy of a Fortune 500 company. However, risk-taking is imperative to innovation in today’s world and it requires vulnerability. Interestingly, the summit report cited earlier found that mental illness takes an exceptionally high toll on knowledge workers whose mental acuity and creativity are essential job requirements. Sharing and collaborating on ideas can be risky business. Only teams that cultivate authentic trust amongst themselves will benefit from the free flow of innovative ideas.

In teams with a solid foundation of trust, individuals will feel safe and comfortable coming forward with personal struggles that might impact their work. Investing in trust pays off in higher performance and improved mental health.

Building resilience is the centerpiece of my corporate wellness practice. Resilience is the ability to not only survive amidst the challenges that life and work dole out to us but to emerge from those challenges stronger. Like a rainy-day fund, it is a resource we tap into during bad times but must invest in when skies are clear.

Resilience flourishes in organizations that invest in the well-being of their employees. A comprehensive, holistic wellness program starts with a corporate wellness assessment. Uncovering the needs, desires, and goals of your employees and organization is crucial in tailoring an effective employee wellness strategy. Stress management and mindfulness workshops, resilience training, and coaching are vital offerings for your employees. Attending to the mind-body connection is also critical, as depression and anxiety often first find a home in the body. Conversely, a healthy body is more resilient in the face of unexpected stress.

Conscious business leaders view investing in emotional and organizational health as more than a preventative measure. The psychological capital of an organization is an invaluable resource. It pays off to safeguard it in the form of improved mental health, employee engagement, and productivity.

Our mental health shapes how we make choices and how we relate to those around us, especially under pressure. A resilient organization enables your employees to thrive amidst challenging and uncertain times.",
"At our agency, Clearbridge Branding, we've seen an increase in demand for preproduced videos and for training and guidance on Facebook Live usage. And this is rightfully so. In my experience, when a video that we produce is uploaded to Facebook, or where we assist in helping the client produce a live video, the analytics show higher rates of viewership, engagement and reach than static content.

Video consumption on Facebook has been quickly growing, and savvy marketers are jumping on the trend to get their brands in front of more people. With over 8 billion average daily video views, it is a smart move. However, much like any social media campaign, there needs to be a plan that follows best practices to ensure that the time and effort being put into the video will meet or exceed the goals for creating and distributing the video in the first place.

Facebook recently released a blog that outlines tips on video best practices for its platform. Optimizing your videos for success on Facebook is important. The platform’s News Feed algorithm ranks popular videos that people return to watch, as well as videos that foster engagement and community interaction, higher than other types of content. When Facebook uses phrases like “… we have sharpened our focus on these News Feed distribution priorities and will continue to do so,” as it did in its best practices blog post, marketers should take note that this is Facebook’s way of giving them advanced notice that this is where your business account’s content should start to navigate.

Depending on your brand and how you want to be perceived, some businesses are fine with lower-quality, more authentic videos. There is no need for expensive lighting and post-production effects. However, if you want to monetize the video, then a bit more time and effort needs to be spent on its production. Facebook recommends that videos have the highest resolution and bit rate possible and not to use still images or slideshows.

Remember, your video is competing for watch time against an unlimited number of other videos, so regardless of quality, try to capture your viewers’ attention right away. This can be done in a few ways, including asking a relevant question right from the start. Make sure to capture their attention with something that will have your viewers saying ""Yes, I want to know how to do that!"" or ""Yes, I want to know more about that."" And keep the introduction of the video short. According to a 2015 study by Microsoft, the average human attention span is eight seconds. A long intro with loud music or too many graphics will quickly have your viewers finding new content. When facilitating videos for our clients, there is no introduction to the piece. We start right into the topic and get people hooked right away.

A video being made for monetization must be at least three minutes, and it is a good idea to produce it while keeping in mind that an ad break should occur within the first one to two minutes of the video. The ad break should be placed right before the big reveal, whether it is the final steps on a how-to or the answer to a burning question everyone wants to know. An ad cannot be placed into your video before one minute of play, so if you are optimizing the video for monetization, try to set that break at the one-minute mark.

While three minutes is the minimum needed for a monetized ad on Facebook, test different lengths and check your analytics to determine what duration your audience responds to best. A length that works for one vertical may not be right for another. Do not hesitate to try shorter format videos as well as longer formats if they are all engaging and directed toward your desired or current audience.

Facebook’s algorithm determines how often people see your content, including videos, based on its relevance, how much engagement is occurring on the content, and how many people are returning to read or view your content. So, it is essential not only to continue to provide your audience with engaging content but also to promote it on your page. Think of it as educating your audience to expect it much like fans of a popular television program know what time and channel the show airs.

Start with consistency in posting. Whether you post every day or every month, posting on the same date and time will help people to remember when to expect your new content.

Next, let people know when to watch by promoting the upcoming video on your Facebook page and other social platforms, in your newsletter and even on your website. During your current video, remind viewers to come back to watch your next segment, and if you know what it will be about, tease the topic. Don’t forget to mention the date and time.

Much like you should with any content, when posting a prerecorded or live video, respond to comments and questions from viewers. Interaction with those watching the video will encourage them to continue to watch and even come back for additional segments. Pro tip: When appropriate, use their name when first responding or answering a question. Using their first name helps to show that they are talking to a real person and not a robot. It also adds a touch of personalization in an overly impersonal world.

When uploading your video or starting a new Facebook Live, be sure to include a thorough description, including keywords and title, so that it can be easily found in a search. Make any copy clear, easy-to-understand and descriptive enough so that viewers will understand the subject matter of the video.

With the growing popularity and consumption of video and the preference that Facebook’s algorithm has placed on it, a video strategy should be a part of every brand’s digital marketing plan. If it’s not in yours already, it’s as easy as coming up with an idea, grabbing your smartphone and pressing record.",
"If you’ve ever heard the term ‘mental health’ and thought this isn’t for me, you may just want to keep reading.

While the language around mental health and mental illness has existed for decades, the conversation itself has become far more open and relevant to all (and rightly so). Mind, the UK’s leading mental health charity summarises it concisely by saying “mental health can affect anyone any day of the year”.

While there is a World ‘Day’ for almost everything, today – World Mental Health Day – feels particularly significant and worthy of attention.

Days like today at the very least, bring global attention to an important conversation and provide an opportunity for people to share and speak up more publicly about their own experiences.

In our increasingly online and social media-filled world, the necessity for people to hear the raw truth of what is really going on has become somewhat of a lifeline. Humans need to create meaning around their experiences to make sense of their lives and stories enable us to do so.

I think there’s a misnomer we’ve created in our own minds that to ‘deserve’ support you must be really depressed.  Or that ‘mental health’ must only be for those clinically ill or suffering really badly.

When we are able to experience others’ vulnerability, when their ‘masks’ are removed, we get to feel far more connected too. The shame we might hold around what we’re really experiencing gets exposed. And as Brene Brown, a global researcher on shame and fear says, shame can’t survive being spoken about.

Plus when others share that ultimately, behind the scenes there are both up and down days, it reiterates that we really are all simply human. Doing the best we can.

And so the conversation has started.

Over the past few weeks I’ve noticed numerous accounts of ‘successful’ people and business owners sharing their personal tales of struggle, depression, heartaches, and pains as part of their contribution to World Mental Health Day. On their own accord, not because someone told them to do so.

Amy Porterfield, an online marketing expert and trainer who has built a multi-million dollar business, and used to work for the world’s most renowned peak performance coach, Tony Robbins, opened up recently in her podcast with another entrepreneurial friend:

""I have definitely, definitely struggled with depression."" Amy Porterfield

In the podcast Amy and her guest Jasmine Star (another successful entrepreneur) also discuss the distinction between situational and clinical depression, acknowledging that most of us will experience situational depression to some degree in our lives.

""Everybody has bad days or a series of bad things that happen."" Jasmine Star

And given that knowledge, why wouldn’t we want to treat our mental health with the same level of respect we give our physical health? Just as easily as you may sign up to a new bootcamp challenge, how eagerly do you give attention to your own mental health?

To this day there are practices and support Amy continues to draw on regularly to maintain and improve her health.

Amy says that ""Mental health issues can be uncomfortable to talk about, but that needs to change.""

Maybe you used to see mental health as not relevant to me. My wish would be that days like today help to normalise mental health, and help people globally feel ‘more human’. To know that it’s okay if there are tough times and that it’s also okay to reach out for support.

Maybe today is about the recognition that you have the power to create an environment for your own personal mental health that feels healthy, sustainable and fulfilling – just as much as you would do with your physical health. And to feel more okay to start a conversation about it.

Note: I am not a mental health expert, nor is this article intended to give you advice. It is intended to make you feel more human. And it is intended to highlight an opportunity to speak up. If you feel you need professional support right now, please consult your GP or visit Mind’s website (a leading UK mental health charity) for more support resources as well as access to their helpline. Should you be experiencing crisis right now this NHS website has links to further support, including free 24/7 support lines.",None
"Most entrepreneurs pound a long and difficult road, but it's well documented that women have the toughest time. A small library's worth of studies has shown that female founders receive a tiny sliver of the tens of billions in venture capital that are invested each year. What's worse, a depressing number of those who have tried to secure such funding say they were discriminated against. Inc. partnered with our sibling publication, Fast Company, for our first-ever State of Women and Entrepreneurship survey. It reveals that 62 percent of women seeking funding report that they have encountered bias in the process.

These findings are stubborn and aggravating, yet the big picture for female entrepreneurship is far from bleak. Women are launching more companies now than in recent decades. And, as editor-at-large Kimberly Weisul notes in ""How #MeToo Has Forced Venture Capital to Become More Inclusive,"" many of the largest venture capital firms are now rushing to add women to their boardrooms.

Moreover, as our inaugural  Female Founders 100 list demonstrates, American business is teeming with creative, ambitious, and thriving women-led companies. Executive editor Danielle Sacks and her team have assembled an all-star roster of fascinating female founders from a vast array of industries. Some of them, like Anne Wojcicki of 23andMe, are already familiar to Inc. readers. Others, like Rachel Haurwitz and Jennifer Doudna of Caribou Biosciences and Tina Sharkey of Brandless, are newcomers to our pages whom we think you'll be hearing a lot more about soon.

The world of business has been achingly slow to create equal opportunities for women and other underrepresented groups. But we are confident that as change takes hold, the women you'll read about in this issue will be the women taking the lead.",
"Getting others to accept our feedback, especially when it's negative, can be challenging. And while it certainly helps to share feedback that's timely, specific, and growth-oriented, the best way to get others to be receptive to feedback is to describe a future they can still change and control.

Too often, managers share feedback that's rooted in the past and prescriptive in nature. If you want your message to produce a more positive and meaningful result, start by changing your feedback mindset.

""Window gazers"" look at their surroundings and tell others what they see. Their view is one-sided and selective. When they size up others, window gazers already know what they're looking for and where to find it. And because their field of vision is hyper-focused, they tend to lose sight of everything else within view.

Window gazers tend to give out very specific but myopic feedback about another person's work. The message tends to be narrowly focused, subjectively framed, and limited in its perspective. It captures only part of the performance picture--the part that the window gazer managed to see.

On the other end of the feedback spectrum, you have ""mirror holders."" These are the individuals who diminish their own view by enlarging the perspective of others. Mirror holders aren't concerned with what they see--you can't see much when you're looking at the mirror's opaque backside--and instead train their sights on helping others discover a better understanding of the issues staring right back at them.

Simply put: Window gazers tell others what to see. Mirror holders challenge others to see it for themselves.

When you give feedback as a mirror holder, you spend more time asking and less time asserting. Your feedback is guided by questions rather than assumptions. Rather than try to force a change, mirror holders attempt to provoke an insight, tilting the feedback dynamics from power to partnership and blame to inquiry. What might have become a fraught exchange turns into a positive exercise in relationship building.

The best feedback helps others understand their strengths and provides the encouragement and guidance to build on those strengths. Mirror holders set the conditions for positive and lasting change. Making that small adjustment in your mindset can produce a world of difference in your message--and just might help others see themselves in an entirely new way.",
"It can be subtle, like failing to make eye contact with a woman business owner but engaging in animated conversation with her male co-owner. Or more blatant, like asking an owner who's seeking investor money if she plans to have children.

Many women business owners say they've encountered gender discrimination from potential investors, customers and employees who don't grasp the reality that a woman can be a CEO, trial attorney or own a technology company. Many women are taken aback at first and don't know how to respond to comments or behavior they find insulting, intrusive and demeaning. But over time, they find strategies to deal with bias.

When Amanda Bradford speaks at technology conferences and forums, discussing coding and algorithms, some men tell her afterward, ""this is something I didn't expect when you opened your mouth."" They assume that because she's a woman, she's the marketer, not the inventor of The League, a dating app.

Gender bias persists although the number of women-owned businesses in the U.S. has grown to more than 10 million from 5.4 million in 1997. Susan Duffy, executive director of the Center for Women's Entrepreneurial Leadership at Babson College, says that while women owners are more visible and accepted than decades ago, ""someone still assumes that if you're the CEO you're the white guy in the suit or the white guy in the hoodie.""

Potential customers or investors often assume that Gabby Slome and Alex Douzet, two of the co-founders of dog food manufacturer Ollie, are married. Outsiders can't seem to get their minds around the fact that Slome, who's married to someone else, could be running a business without her husband, or without him bankrolling her.

""They think, he must have funded me. They don't understand that I'm doing this independently of him,"" says Slome, whose two-year-old company is based in Manhattan.

""Have your antenna up so you know it when you see it and have two or three ready-to-go behaviors in your back pocket to manage it in the moment for the best outcome,"" Duffy says.

Sally Strebel has noticed that when her male business partner leaves her side at meetings, ""other men will approach and ask me a question about my company and then tell me how they are building something better and that I should watch out."" Strebel, co-founder of Pagely, a website hosting company based in Tucson, Arizona, realizes they want to intimidate her.

She's also been in meetings where she wasn't given the chance to speak. For a while, she was silent. But as time went on, she realized that she has the right to speak.

Noushin Ketabi has noticed that when she and her husband and business partner Rob Terenzi meet with male executives, they speak to him and don't make eye contact with her. They seem to perceive him as the ultimate decision-maker in their coffee company, Vega.

""The question itself was extremely inappropriate and personal that had nothing to do with the company,"" says Fowler, co-founder of Edited, a retail technology company with offices in New York, San Francisco and London.

Michelle Kennedy has found potential investors don't trust that she knows her product and the market for it. She did market research before seeking investor funding for Peanut, an app that helps mothers connect with one another. But even as recently as 2016, potential investors would say, ""I don't know. I need to speak to my wife or my secretary, my sister, my daughter who will know better"" than she does, Kennedy says.",None
"This is a story about unhappy American Airlines employees. And, it's also about what you can learn in our country's courthouses.

It's amazing what you find when you check out companies and the lawsuits they're involved in.

Sometimes it's frivolous stuff, like the people suing McDonald's for charging for cheese in their Quarter Pounders. Sometimes, it's intriguing, like the passenger who sued Southwest Airlines for exactly ""$74,999.99 and nothing more.""

And sometimes, it's things like newly filed amended complaint (.pdf) in a lawsuit that a group of American Airlines employees filed against their own airline (among other defendants), in which they accuse American's management of creating ""a public health crisis,"" and of flat-out fraud.

The case is about the uniforms that American Airlines rolled out in 2016. According to the lawsuit, they're toxic and unsafe, and have resulted in literally ""thousands"" of health complaints by American Airlines employees.

Last year, a judge let the lawsuit go forth against the uniform manufacturer, but said it would need to revised to keep American Airlines in the suit as well. And the amended complaint, filed earlier this month, delivers--with extremely blunt and accusatory language.

It claims there's been ""a concerted effort--at the highest levels of American's corporate organization--to fraudulently cover up the dangers posed by these uniforms ... [f]rom the first wear test in 2015 to this day.""

And, the plaintiffs say that ""American's upper level management ... continues to pretend the uniforms are safe, and and to portray anyone who dared to complain as an isolated incident, overly sensitive, or a malingerer.""

Unfortunately, there's nothing unusual about unhappy American Airlines employees. Think of the American Airlines flight attendants who picketed their own airline's headquarters in August, calling their new scheduling policy ""cruel"" and ""disastrous.""

Or the American Airlines employees who told me after I wrote about that policy, that their airline was: ""unacceptable,"" ""ridiculous,"" ""inhumane,"" ""horrible,"" and ""suitable for robots.""

Heck, go back more than a decade, to the infamous ""Man, I Hate American Airlines"" email that the CEO of The Ladders, Marc Cenedella, sent to 4 million subscribers.

It basically describes his experience watching an especially sour American Airlines flight attendant going about her job while wearing a button that read, ""I Have No Idea Why I Work Here.""

More than 10 years later, it seems like a lot of American Airlines employees still feel the same way. And it brings me no joy to write about this kind of thing. In fact, it's perhaps the saddest thing about this whole story.

American Airlines is one of the big four, and by some measures the largest airline in the world. It would be better for everyone if it were run in a way that inspired widespread pride among its employees, instead of these kinds of issues.

""We are reviewing the filing and while we cannot comment on ongoing litigation, we remain committed to delivering uniforms from a new supplier despite the fact that all tests have found the uniforms meet or exceed industry safety standards. In the meantime, we have provided several alternatives so that everyone can be in a uniform they feel comfortable wearing.""",
"From social media to augmented realities, technology is shaping people's lives in unprecedented ways--and perhaps nowhere is this more obvious than in the world of sports.

As technologies infuse every aspect of the sporting world, athletes, athleticism, and sports viewership are all changing in remarkable ways. Here's a look at just five of the many ways in which tech will influence the future of sports .

The bar for athletic performance will continue to rise.

Thanks to wearable tech , athletes can now embed tiny GPS, accelerometers, and other data collection tools in their jerseys and/or cleats. These tools track everything from distances run to heart rate, speed, jump height, fatigue, overtraining, hydration levels, muscle activation, respiratory rhythms, neurological activity, sleep patterns , and other health markers. Meanwhile, the prevalence of high-speed and high-definition cameras allows athletes and teams to record their movements and training sessions in unprecedented detail, thereby facilitating in-depth reviews of athletic performance.

Together, all of this data enables athletes and coaches to develop more effective training regimens, dial in their form, identify factors that enhance or diminish athletic performance, and so on--all of which has the potential to raise the bar on athletic performance.

Injury prevention and treatment will become more effective and refined.

Tech is making sports safer in a number of ways. For example, the evolution of smart helmets and other wearable tech allows for better monitoring of potentially traumatic injuries, which paves the way for more immediate and effective medical care. It also provides an opportunity to collect data about collisions and identify patterns for better sports injury prevention.

Meanwhile, injury rehabilitation is also getting a boost from tech. For example, anti-gravity treadmills enable athletes to maintain at least some level of physical fitness while recovering from injuries that might be aggravated by weight-bearing activities, while research suggests utilizing VR (virtual reality) gaming technologies might assist with the treatment of neck and spinal injuries.

Referees will get a boost from tech.

We've all witnessed the poor referee who makes a call that's loathed by one or the other team's fan base and is personally pilloried as a result. Advancements in tech may offer these hapless refs some relief. New technologies--such as 360-degree cameras and FIFA's goal-line monitors--will take some pressure off referees and ensure greater accuracy while adjudicating sports.

Athletes, protégés, and fans will interact with each other in new and exciting ways.

Technologies such as the internet and cryptocurrencies are decentralizing the world of sports in several ways, thereby facilitating unprecedented relationships between athletes, aspiring athletes, and fans.

For example, 433token plans to offer opportunities for some of the world's greatest soccer players to mentor up to five youth talents at a time. These mentorships will be sponsored by soccer fans who are invested in cultivating the next generation of talent. It's a unique platform that will open up new opportunities for aspiring soccer players to apprentice under some of the world's best players--and for fans to have a say in who becomes the next major player in their favorite sport. This type of interaction wouldn't be possible without advancements in tech.

The viewer experience will be transformed.",
"You're a little nervous, and you know this meeting will determine your future. You sit down and listen intently to what the banker is saying as he or she covers all of the financial details. Obviously, you are clued in to the discussion, but at one point the banker mentions something a bit odd. It's a minor point about capital gains tax, and the year the rule changed. So, you scratch your head and pull out your phone.

Sadly, a new school of thought has emerged, likely propagated by people who did not grow up with phones or tend to stick with a desktop computer during work hours.

A few years ago, an expert on this topic suggested to me that no one would ever bring a phone to a meeting with a banker. You need to stay focused and intent.

Initially, I agreed and it made sense. In fact, I've repeated the story several times. I've also repeated the word ""phubbing"" (e.g., to phone snub) and explained how it's a bad, terrible, no good thing. A more technical phrase is ""continuous partial attention"" which is one of the scariest concepts of our age. It means people are always in a state of partial attention because they are either on a phone or thinking about being on a phone.

I once heard a phrase, attributed to the musician David Crowder, that you should do something so cool that you don't need to look at your phone. The same concept should apply to meetings. As someone who frequently mentors college students, I know that the minute a meeting becomes boring and routine, people tend to pull out phones or mindlessly surf on a laptop--suddenly, Fortnite is more interesting. Who can blame them? It's not the laptop's fault. It's the meeting topic and the meeting presenter.

My view is that gadgets can help us verify information, they can help us add to the conversation, to look up interesting facts. Distraction is a bad thing, but there are other ways to solve that problem instead of banning our devices altogether.

In my example of the mortgage meeting, of course you would never mindlessly surf Instagram during the chat. Should you ban phones? Not at all, because they can serve a purpose, especially if you stop someone in mid-sentence and ask politely if you can check on some details. In my meetings with college students, I rarely see people surfing or looking at cat videos because we tend to keep meetings short and lively. And, every meeting is a ""working"" meeting. Laptops help at meetings, they don't hinder. No one ever focuses on a laptop or phone during a meeting that is lively and engaging.

If someone does start phubbing, it reveals a much deeper problem. If the meeting is important and the discussion is good, and someone still phone surfs, it's a sign that maybe there's a problem with engagement on a project. Sometimes, it's a sign of depression or some other difficulty in life. Or, it's a sign of an unruly employee revealing many other issues for you to worry about other than using a gadget instead of paying attention.",
"""Balance"" is not so much a buzzword as it is a platitude at this point.

An age-old virtue, the concept of ""balance"" can be traced to ancient religious and spiritual texts from the East. Today, we mostly hear about it in regard to juggling our personal and professional lives.

That's why so many people can't achieve it.

It's not that balance isn't possible, it's that it's undesirable.

Balance often feels like the antithesis to living a passionate, fulfilled life. Most people crave immersive experiences, their greatest desire to work in a state of flow. Most people want to lose themselves in love, in art, in whatever makes them think and feel deeply.

But nature itself is an acutely precise balancing act. The amount of bacteria in the body weighs as much as your brain does — about three pounds. The body is designed to maintain a balance of acidity and alkalinity. Your heart rate and thought processes are governed by a homeostatic impulse. Your body does everything in its power to maintain is homeostasis. Understanding this is absolutely crucial to understanding how your mind works, too.

Neurologically, you can argue that ""mental strength"" can be traced to the amygdala. That's the part of the brain that controls creativity and, incidentally, rumination. In other words, worrying. This is why there's a correlation between artists and depression — it's not just a stereotype.

What's less talked about, however, is that innovators, entrepreneurs, and business owners? They are highly creative people, too.

Creativity and worry are opposite results of the same function: imagining what does not yet exist. In order to maintain mental strength, it is crucial to remember that you must strike a perfect balance between being creative but not allowing your thoughts to spiral and convince you that your fears are as real as your dreams and ambitions.

Often, people stress out the most because they liken themselves to an oracle of sorts. They have a hard time telling the difference between what's an irrational fear, and what's an intuitive nudge trying to alert them to a potential threat. Most of the time, the reason why your ambitions become reality and your fears often pass is that you don't take action on them.

When you are imagining potential outcomes or ideas, you're using your mind's fullest creative potential. However, none of it is real... yet. It's simply your way of down board thinking and navigating potential paths of action. Once you can imagine the outcome, you start adapting your behaviors to make that idea a reality.

Fear only takes over your life and stifles you when you place too much emphasis on it. Creative people will always be more prone to imagining the worst possible scenarios. Rather than being freaked out by them, the better approach is to see them as guides toward what you don't want — signals toward what you ultimately want to create.

You cannot always control what thoughts cross your mind. What you do control, however, is which you respond to and which you give meaning to. It is in that process that you create emotional responses, and from those emotional responses, you create behaviors and habits. From behaviors and habits, you see outcomes. But it all starts with your ability to keep your creativity in check.",None
"The dot-com explosion of the late '90s and early aughts drastically altered the economics of knowledge. Prior to the internet, the vast majority of information was accessible only through education, mentorship and written literature. Today, however, the idea of picking up an encyclopedia is laughable; the vast majority of information on almost any topic is easily searchable, fully codified and available through numerous sources. This accessibility has altered the value of data and information, making it cheap or oftentimes even free.

As the volume of accessible information increases, the value of it decreases. In tandem with this value shift, however, the price of nonindexed, private, nonsearchable information has skyrocketed. For the sake of clarity, I will differentiate this type of data from “information” (raw information available online) by referring to it as “expert knowledge.” Expert knowledge is the tiny sliver of high-quality experience, proprietary information and niche knowledge that is not indexed on Google, Quora, Wikipedia or even in books. It’s the kind of knowledge on any given topic that only a few experts — or even just one or two — in the world possess, and this is what makes it so valuable.

The microeconomic law of supply and demand states that price determination in a market is a function of the availability of a product versus the demand for said product. While demand for information has grown over the past two decades, supply of information has outpaced demand. To illustrate this, try to remember the last time you made it to the third page of Google search results. Accordingly, the value of this information has gone down. For instance, the cost per gigabyte of data stored on a hard drive dropped from over $100,000 in 1980 to significantly less than 1 cent today.

The market is skewed toward granting access to and analysis of this type of information. Search engines like Google, content platforms like Quora or Wikipedia, data processing and storage platforms like Hadoop, and business intelligence tools like Tableau all essentially analyze and repackage already codified information to make it even more accessible.

The industry for nonaccessible expert knowledge, however, is decidedly smaller.

Just as Google created the first search engine for codified content, winning over the economy of information 20 years ago, there is now a new opportunity to create a search engine for noncodified content: the ""Google"" of expert knowledge. This type of knowledge exists currently only through conversations, dialogue, teaching and learning. It’s the type of information that is held by only a few experts who have no motivation to translate the knowledge into searchable formats, which means that locating these people is nearly impossible. After all, if their expertise is not indexed on the internet, locating and finding them in order to access their knowledge is extremely difficult.

In the recent book Flights by Olga Tokarczuk, the narrator muses about Wikipedia: “We should have some other collection of knowledge, then, to balance [Wikipedia] out — its inverse, its inner lining, everything we don’t know, all the things that can’t be captured in any index, can’t be handled by any search engine.”

Indeed, we do need an inverse to Wikipedia, to codified content. We need a collection of knowledge that could help someone who needs to learn about an emerging technology, like blockchain, or a highly specific field, such as the separation of vanadium from titanium in titano-magnetite ore in Peru.

Already, businesses (and in particular, startups) are hiring for knowledge and skill rather than experience or advanced degrees. While platforms like LinkedIn provide public access to skills and job history, they do not provide a codified view of knowledge. To determine that, companies have to sift through laborious searches and screening interviews until they finally gain access to the one person who holds a set of skills and knowledge.

The first company to create a search engine for finding the one person with a precise set of knowledge in the world will end up winning a new market, one that is currently incredibly valuable. Then, we will enter a new era in the economy of knowledge.",
"Despite the stereotypical image of the outgoing ""people"" person manager, you don't have to be an extrovert to be an effective leader. The business world needs all types of personalities, from outgoing and energetic to quiet and passionate.

Because introverts are often great listeners who seek to establish strong one-on-one relationships, they can be great leaders who help their team reach their full potential. Twelve members of Forbes Coaches Council offered leadership advice for introverted individuals looking to channel their strengths in the workplace.

Your ability to influence others isn't built on an outgoing personality. Rather, team members want to follow leaders whom they believe have empathy, intellect, discernment and predictability. Therefore, get to know your people so you can help them achieve their career goals, make sound decisions based on data, and deliver a consistent message. - CJ McClanahan, CJ McClanahan

People follow someone because they feel strength of conviction, clarity in their vision, confidence, compassion, decisiveness and quiet authority. Besides these qualities, an introverted leader can still be an attentive and a patient listener, which is often more important than the ability of a great orator. - Masha Malka, The One Minute Coach

Because introverts tend to be good listeners, they usually put together themes of conversations well and can identify the real issue or the highest-level concern that needs to be addressed in most situations. It's their superpower to prioritize first things first in many situations. - Lynda Foster, Cortex Leadership Consulting

Often, extroverts tend to dominate creative meetings and can become locked into one idea for which they lobby. An introvert can help teams cultivate creativity and also allow other introverts to thrive by encouraging teams to develop multiple ideas ""offline"" before a brainstorming meeting, and then anonymizing those ideas and concepts. - Billy Williams, Archegos

Introverted leaders often struggle with stepping fully into leadership because the examples they see most are extroverted leaders leading from the front. Give yourself permission to lead from behind. This effective style puts the focus on developing your team's leadership and doing the strategic and critical thinking work required to create sustainability for the future. - Jenn Lofgren, Incito Executive & Leadership Development

A great strategy for introverts (and it would also be very helpful for extroverts!) is to ask open-ended questions and let others do the talking. Not only does it help an introvert connect and communicate, it benefits their team by giving them a chance to share their ideas, thoughts and opinions. - Renelle Darr, InSight Coaching & Consulting

As introverts, we want to be compassionate and have quality space to support our colleagues in. Yet we can quickly overexert our energy and feel overwhelmed by the needs of others. Create boundaries and be transparent about how you prefer to communicate. It's OK to not be available all the time. Invite people to schedule meetings and email you instead of pop up with needs on a whim. - Hanna Hermanson, Dream Life is Real Life

As a leader, you are continually in the spotlight. Taking time for yourself to recharge is crucial so that you can continue to be there for your followers. A quick recharge can mean shutting your door for 15 minutes each day and doing some form of mindfulness practice. Calming the mental chatter is like rebooting your computer. It brings clarity to your thinking and decision-making. - Melinda Fouts, Ph.D., Success Starts With You

9. Take Control Of Your Team's Perceptions Of You

In a landscape where extroverted qualities are revered, it is essential to let people know that a lack of verbalization has more to do with introspection rather than shyness. Many introverts do not set the stage for how they want to be perceived. This gives way to unwanted assumptions. Communicating what your silence means is crucial. - Indira Bimont, INNERtia Project

10. Know When To Venture Outside Your Comfort Zone

Being introverted does not mean a person cannot adjust and be outgoing and assertive when the situation calls for it. We all have a default that is comfortable, and that can be a great asset, but leaders must venture outside of that comfort zone at times. Through coaching, leaders can gain awareness of themselves, learn to leverage their strengths and develop strategies to fill in their gaps. - Andrea MacKenzie, Lead With Harmony

Co-opt the old adage: Give yourself wings to expand in new areas that make you uncomfortable while staying grounded in the roots of who you truly are. No one says you have to transform yourself into head cheerleader, but allow yourself the ability to come off the sidelines and take on a more active and visible role using the strengths and abilities you already possess. - Tonya Echols, Thrive Coaching Solutions

12. Aim First To Connect With And Inspire People

Don't mask who you truly are. Letting your true self shine through is what is really going to make you successful. Leaders can be any personality type as long as they can still connect with people and inspire them to want to follow them. Success comes in many forms. Follow your own authentic path and allow yourself to truly thrive. - Monica Thakrar, MTI",communication
"Years ago, my dad gave me a book: Why Good Girls Don’t Get Ahead But Gutsy Girls Do. While there’s nothing wrong with being assertive, I disagree with the book’s premise that “good” people can’t get ahead.

More importantly, the goal of life shouldn’t be to blindly focus on “getting ahead.” We each must define personal success based on what we want and not let anyone define that for us.

Here are seven tips to achieve success and experience more happiness and well-being in life:

Determine what you’re naturally good at (which is often apparent early on), and then work to achieve mastery. Being well-rounded is overrated. I was not wired for math, computer programming or parallel parking. Writing, persuasion and communications? I’ve been rocking that block since preschool.

Malcolm Gladwell and others contend that 10,000 hours of practice helps you become an expert, just as author Cal Newport argues “deliberate practice” -- knowing how to practice to achieve your personal best advantage -- is what makes people “ridiculously successful.”

Either way, read every book, take every class, ask questions, listen and learn from everyone around you. As Steve Martin has been quoted saying, “Be so good they can’t ignore you.”

But that doesn’t mean you arrive right away. At one of my early jobs, I read 35 advertising, branding and copywriting “how to” books in one year and was the first one in the office every day. I had to prove my worth and increase my skills, and I was happy doing what I love -- and still am today.

2. Defend yourself (and your work) with data.

I recently read that “data is verbal karate.” Data proves your point, showcases your value, tells your story, demonstrates your impact, directs your decisions, informs your strategy.

Rather than karate chop a dissenting colleague or deliver a roundhouse kick to your boss’ head, use data to make your case more compelling.

Make a positive impact wherever you are. Encourage your coworkers. Live ethically. Do what you say you will do. Treat others the way you want to be treated. Advocate for your team. Bring your best self to work every day.

Your character builds your career. Not only will you maintain stronger relationships, but you’ll likely sleep better, and your friends will be there when you need them. Plus, everyone can volunteer their time or expertise, raise their voice for causes they care about and donate goods or money to make the world a better place.

Studies show people who donate money or volunteer are much happier and healthier, and that faith can be linked to a happier adulthood. We’ve all seen the movies. Scrooge isn’t happy penny-pinching and abusing others, and Darth Vader eventually deserts the dark side and repairs his relationships.

Your network of friends, bosses, coworkers, clients, customers, partners and vendors becomes your lifeline. People help and hire other people, not companies. Relationships -- being connected to each other -- are often one of life’s prime joys.

Gallup research has shown that having a work best friend increases performance. We all know who you work with (and for) often makes or breaks a job. Who you know often helps you find a new job or new client, or receive employee referrals. You never know who will end up as your boss, board member, mentor, partner, employee or client.

Every day, you make a choice on how to live. You can choose to be thankful. Even on your worst day, you can always find something: family, friends, food, faith, health, your job, a home.

Sometimes the only thing you may be able to muster is that you’re glad the day is over. Start there. Oftentimes, setbacks, disappointments, budget cuts and other perceived negatives are opportunities in disguise -- opportunities to be creative, think differently and try something new.

Some of my greatest successes have come from overcoming what was originally a setback. If you focus on the positive, you’ll achieve more and be happier doing it. In fact, according to a recent Time article, “Optimists are more resilient. They make better entrepreneurs, experience better health outcomes, live longer and are more satisfied with their relationships.”

The good news is, optimism can be taught, so we all can practice more gratitude and focus on the good.

6. Remember, there’s more to life than money.

Many impressive jobs can suck the life out of you with demanding and extensive travel, long hours, terrible commutes and intense pressure. You may clamber to the top of the corporate ladder only to discover you feel alone and miserable.

Consider carefully the kind of lifestyle that matters to you. Do you want flexibility for friends, family, pets, exercise, hobbies or volunteer work? How much stress and responsibility do you want? Only you can answer that.

Keeping up with the Kardashians probably won’t make you happy. Research shows the ideal amount of money for happiness is only $60,000-75,000 annually. Making too much money can even lead to decreased emotional well-being. We’ve all read stories about lottery winners who are miserable.

Can money make you happy? Harvard Business School professor Michael Norton’s research shows that money can indeed buy happiness -- if you spend it on other people.

Change happens to us whether we like it or not. Rather than fear change, embrace it. If you don’t like something in your life, change it.

That may mean changing jobs, changing states, changing habits, changing your lifestyle, getting a new degree, downsizing your home. And it may mean going out of the frying pan, into the fire, and changing again.

If you work hard, invest in the right things and stay positive, no matter what happens, you’ll likely have what you need to get through it.

Good people do get ahead, especially when you define what a good life means to you. So, here’s to your success, happiness and well-being.",
"I don’t know about you, but I’m finding recruitment harder. As the job market tightens, the job seekers that we call in for interviews know that they have options. I’m that sure our team members know that they have options, too. There are always other companies looking for good people with their track records, and losing any one of them would be a blow. I know I have to work hard to retain each one of them.

No successful company today can take its employees for granted. We business owners have to show that we appreciate their work and value what they do.

The most obvious way to do that is to offer them more money, but while financial rewards have a role in retention, they’re not the most important factor in motivating employees. Surveys consistently show how opportunities, career progress, and recognition can be more important to employees than the money in their pay packet.

I’ve found that a focus on productivity not only keeps employees working, it also helps to keep them working for my businesses.

That might sound counterintuitive. Surely, staff would want to do less work for more money, not more work for the same money. But what employees really want is what we all want: the satisfaction that comes from achievement. They want to be able to say “I did that!” just as much as I do. They reach those achievements faster when they’re more productive.

I do three things to raise productivity and, in the process, retain my staff:

Clear communication is always important for productivity, but it doesn’t just mean putting bullet points in your memos. It also means laying out how many more steps are needed to reach a milestone so that everyone can see that an achievement is in sight. It means sharing positive feedback from customers so that team members can see that what they do has a real impact on real people. It means publicly praising employees who have made an extra effort or achieved something extraordinary.

Knowing that what they do matters and is recognized helps employees to stay focused on the goal and to realize that the goal is important.

Meetings are an inevitable part of business, even if they’re not the most interesting part — or the most productive. But you can make them more productive by using calendar software to schedule them and including in the invite information about what the meeting will discuss. All participants should come to the meeting prepared. They should have responses to the questions that the meeting will raise and have the facts on hand that can support their positions.

The fewer people you have at a meeting, the more productive it’s likely to be, so also make sure that those who aren’t attending are consulted before the meeting takes place. Ask them whether they have any questions or suggestions they want raised, and tell them what happened when their ideas were discussed.

You can’t call everyone into every meeting. But you can make all employees feel that their voice matters and their opinions are heard.

3. Let Your Employees Grow Into Their Abilities

Employees leave when they feel they have nowhere in the company left to go. Once team members have mastered their roles, give them new challenges. You can ask them to mentor a new employee, give them a project for which they have complete responsibility, or pay for them to learn a new skill. Sure, you’ll be running the risk that they’ll take their new abilities and go off to a different employer. But as long as they know that they have room to grow with you, they’ll be much more likely to stay — and you’ll get much more out of them.

Raising your employees’ productivity looks like a self-interested act for your business. But when your employees want to achieve important things, helping them to do so will keep them with you. And if they don’t want to achieve important things, why do you want them at your company?",coaching
"Stanford economist Nicholas Bloom is a true believer, and like many true believers, he lets his message outrun his evidence. Based on a single study of a Chinese travel agency, he enthusiastically declares working from home a “future-looking technology” with “enormous potential.”

Bloom’s study comes with serious limitations and is contradicted by a later Gallup report. However, while it is far too soon to draw broad conclusions from his findings, savvy business leaders can read between the lines and extract some valuable lessons for working optimally with all employees.

Bloom focused on China’s biggest travel agency, Ctrip, which wanted to expand while controlling office space costs. They instituted a remote work trial, expecting that productivity would slip a little, but not enough to cancel out the savings. Instead, productivity shot up 13%, and attrition dropped 50%. When the work from home option was rolled out to the entire company and employees were given a choice, the productivity gains were 22%.

Those gains are impressive, but it is important to keep in mind that the Ctrip employees are just doing call center work that requires little creativity or collaboration. The trust and teamwork essential for innovation in today’s business world benefit from some in-person interaction, and a Gallup report backs that up.

Gallup found that a remote work option improved engagement and employee satisfaction—but only up to a point. The most engaged employees were those who worked remotely part of the time, anywhere from 60% to 80%. Beyond that, remote work produced diminishing returns. In fact, the least engaged employees were those who worked remotely 100% of the time.

“Working remotely is most effective when there’s a home-office balance,” the report concludes. The optimal home-office balance will vary from industry to industry and within a company. Leaders and managers have to consider the nature of the work and the personality type of the employee.

The larger mission facing business leaders is to design a work experience that gets the best out of each employee. While Bloom’s findings and conclusions should be taken with a grain of salt, they do suggest some broader lessons.

It is no accident that productivity at the travel agency was boosted even further once the element of choice was introduced. Choice is empowering, and empowered employees are more engaged and productive.

Leaders and managers can apply that lesson in a multitude of ways, even in those cases where remote work is not feasible. We all operate according to a different underlying circadian rhythm. Some of us get our best work done in the morning, while others get off to a slow start and hit their stride later in the day.

Learn to work with your employees’ natural tendencies and dispositions. Identify when, how, and where they do their best work and build from there. Replicate the freedom and flexibility remote workers enjoy.

There are countless ways of introducing more autonomy into your workplace. Granting an employee creative leeway over how to approach a task demonstrates trust and belief in their abilities. There is great power to the simple question, “What do you think?”

In cases where remote work is feasible at least part of the time, work within the realities of an employee’s unique situation rather than applying one-size-fits-all solutions. When you empower employees to manage all areas of their lives better, they will be more energized and engaged—and produce better results.

Advocates of remote work agree that one of the significant advantages of working from home is being free from the distractions of the workplace. Those distractions have multiplied with the advent of open design office spaces which foster communication and collaboration but can make concentration difficult.

The design firm Gensler, a proponent of open design, acknowledges that when it comes to creating a balance between focus and collaboration, focus comes first. Leaders who want productive employees must do everything in their power to enable and ensure the ability to focus, and office design is only one part of the equation.

Once again it is essential to understand and appreciate individual differences. Some of us enjoy being surrounded by bustle and buzz and feed off that energy. Others require the silence of a library. Create quiet zones in your workplace for those who need it. Identify introverts and actively solicit their ideas about how they can get their best work done.

Productivity arises when we give employees meaningful and challenging work, and then give them the resources necessary to do it. Focus is a critical resource. Think of yourself as a guardian of concentration.

The Gallup report talks about attaining the right home-office balance. Balance is good, but the importance of variety may be the more impactful takeaway from the remote work studies.

Remote workers report enjoying the freedom to juggle their days in ways that keep them energized. If you are stuck on a problem, you can go outside and take a walk around the block without looking like you are wasting time. After you finish putting together a big presentation, you can reward yourself and blow off some steam by doing a quick workout. It is well-established that multi-tasking is not a productive approach to work. On the other hand, switching tasks when we are stuck or losing energy is a great way to maintain focus and engagement. Frequent short breaks can refresh our minds and our bodies.

Business leaders should actively inject a sense of play into the workplace, give employees the freedom to recharge and shift gears and encourage people to shake up well-worn routines. An organizational culture where being glued to one’s desk for hours at a time is seen as a sign of devotion and hard work is not a productive one. It is counter-productive and not sustainable long-term.

Gallup finds that the percentage of employees working at least part of the time remotely has been rising steadily in recent years. Those numbers are part of a larger trend in which today’s workers increasingly value autonomy, flexibility, variety, and choice. Smart business leaders will stay ahead of the curve and continuously look for ways to make those values central to their organizational culture.",
"Likability is one of the most important traits of any leader. But it doesn't mean being a pushover. Often, the leaders who are the most likable produce the best results, and are driven and passionate. People respect the high standard that they set for themselves and their organizations. To be likable, leaders need to be the kind of person that they would like themselves.

Likability starts with a decision to become likable. Some leaders are likable and others are not — because they choose to be. Often, leaders who are the most fulfilled genuinely desire to be liked by others.

Here are five ways to be a more likable leader.

For others to like you, they must know you. For them to know you, you must know yourself. Every likable CEO has foundational principles for who they are and the person they desire to become. These are concrete guideposts that shape their thinking and their decisions. When you communicate these guideposts, others are attracted to your leadership and your core values.

What are the concrete guideposts that guide your decisions in leadership and life?

2. Be curious about other people.

In How to Win Friends and Influence People, the notable Dale Carnegie stated the importance of being ""genuinely interested in other people."" Every CEO should make it a priority to be curious about their team and the people they meet. Any one person has the ability to teach you something. When you are curious about others and seek to learn what they can show you, it often leads them to like you.

How curious are you about others? What's the one thing you might be interested in learning about any person you meet?

3. Grow yourself and your outlook.

People are attracted to people who focus on their own growth and development. Growing CEOs have a different outlook on life and experiences because they continue to stay fresh and up to date on the newest thinking that is changing the marketplace. People like to learn from these leaders.

What experience has allowed you to grow your outlook in the last six months?

4. Be diligent about acts of thoughtfulness.

Many times, likability is a direct result of thoughtfulness. Though you don't read about thoughtfulness in many business books, it's a key element to good business and to developing a likable personality. Thoughtful acts of kindness such as writing notes, acknowledging great work, or offering words of affirmation can go a long way in developing a friendly spirit.

How diligent have you been lately at performing acts of thoughtfulness?

5. See the best in others.

People like to be around people who see their potential. There is an old saying: ""When we seek to discover the best in others, we somehow bring out the best in ourselves.""

One complaint that many leaders and CEOs receive from their key staff is that they only focus on the negative or on what needs to be improved. Although it is essential to focus on improvement, it is equally as important to find and elicit the best in others.

Can you name the best ability of every person on your team?

Here is an essential truth that leaders would be wise to embrace: You will never become the best leader you can be until you become a likable one.",
"We see a steak selling for $8 at the supermarket and we assume that’s what everybody else will pay. (Unless there’s a loyalty card special.)

Airline passengers packed on board a flight… a different story. We assume everyone in our cabin is paying a different fare… in some instances, dramatically different fares.

Our perceptions of price are inextricably linked to value. They are also connected to a sense of fairness.

As algorithms come into play and the pricing practices of yield management pioneered by airlines decades ago expand, both the customer’s perception of price and the marketer’s process of establishing price become more complex.

Warren Buffet’s observation, “Price is what you pay, value is what you get,” has a growing significance for marketers.

As dynamic or differentiated pricing expands, strategic marketing decisions on the role of price take on increasing complexity and importance.

There are two key considerations for dynamic pricing:

“Differential or dynamic pricing should be considered within the organization’s marketing strategy any time there is a difference in demand that can be measured and attributed, whether by time or by person and segment,” says Stephen Walls, senior lecturer at the The University of Texas McCombs School of Business.

As with virtually everything else in marketing, the strategy and tactics should be consumer-centric.

“A well-designed dynamic pricing strategy is consumer-friendly,” says Harry Tomasides, chief revenue officer with Digonex, a dynamic pricing solutions firm.

“The strategy generally works better if consumers understand the system and are empowered to make a purchase decision that best meets their personal constellation of needs.

“It will often give savvy consumers access to lower prices than would be possible under a traditional pricing model and allow enhanced access to ‘scarce’ products or services to the consumers that value them the most.”

Professor Walls sees much the same opportunity for win-win outcomes.

“For services that experience swings in demand throughout a season or year, differential/dynamic pricing should be explored to drive demand during the off periods or smooth out demand overall.""

In the supermarket, we know the loyalty program customer pays less.

Transparency appears on a price tag hanging from the shelf.

In the digital world, transparency may not be as forthcoming, and this absence or shrouding of transparency could derail a marketer’s dynamic pricing initiative.

“We think most companies get more out of their dynamic pricing strategy by being transparent about it, ensuring that the ‘rules of the game’ are based in fairness principles and that those rules are communicated to customers,” says Tomasides.

“My default perspective is that differential pricing should be transparent. When it is well-designed, the strategy explicitly drives desired behavior and can generally be viewed positively or neutrally in the marketplace.

“Given the digital nature of most marketplaces, customers will eventually discover differential pricing and, when it appears to be intentionally hidden, will be viewed negatively.”

When a caste system is created, the risk of blowbacks is raised.

Dynamic pricing driven by segmentation can be difficult to both design and execute.

“This situation is more challenging to execute well,” says Walls, “with a greater risk of customers discovering the pricing difference and responding negatively to the differential treatment.”",
"Whether you love it or hate it, business travel is a sometimes necessary expense. Depending on your business, you may be offered extra flat fee funds, often referred to as a per diem, to help cover food, transportation, and other necessary costs while traveling for business. If you spend less than you are given, you may (usually) keep the leftover funds.

However, if you spend more than you are given, you will need to pay out of pocket. While these funds are meant to be enough, sometimes they don't go quite as far as you'd like. I've had more than a few instances of going over a budget that I wasn't quite expecting.

However, years of traveling have shown me a few tips and tricks to not only manage the per diem but also how to do it with style. Here are a few things I've learned.

If possible, find a hotel with continental breakfast options so you can fuel up on a good breakfast. Also, if you find hotels that have suites, take advantage of their mini-kitchens in your hotel room. Also, a hotel in close proximity to your event is a wise choice.

I also recommend joining hotel loyalty programs and applying for travel credit cards. Many people don't realize that one hotel brand owns several other brands (e.g. IHG includes Holiday Inn brands, Staybridge Suites, Kimpton Hotels, etc.). Oftentimes, their credit card benefits include upgrades and free nights.

Cut costs by ride sharing with coworkers or even with strangers via Uber, Lyft, or any other ridesharing option. You will not only meet the locals, but you may also land a new client. Unless I'm in a massive rush, sharing a car saves me money, eases the stress of navigating and parking in an unfamiliar place, and usually leads to an interesting conversation.

Additionally, aside from trains and buses, cycling and even taking a scooter may be potential options. Before I go to a new place, I like to check Google Maps to see what options I may have. Sometimes I do half of my journey on foot as a way to see the city.

One of the reasons I enjoy taking a ride share car to my destination is because you can usually strike up a conversation about food. People generally enjoy telling you the best place to get their favorite dish. By doing this, I not only break the ice, but I also learn what is good to eat (shoutout to my recent driver led me to a food truck extravaganza).

To really maximize your per diem, eat healthy homemade meals by stocking up on fruits, vegetables, and nonperishable items. The general rule is to save the fancy or more expensive meal for dinner. Check online for food delivery site coupons or use sites like Groupon for further savings.

4. Know what is and isn't allowed.

It's always wise to know any restrictions that aren't covered by the per diem. Per diem allowances will vary by employer and even by state to state, so be sure to speak to HR and follow ethical practices. Be aware that taxes may also be affected by the per diem.",
"China has recently emerged as a global economic leader. According to the World Bank, it currently has the second largest economy with 15.1 percent of global GDP (behind the U.S. at 24 percent).

The country is building a new ""Silk Road"" to help usher the world into the global age, and it even leads the World Intellectual Property Organization in patents filed.

Given China's enormous, fast-growing economy and the fact that its business culture is dramatically different than that of the U.S., it's smart to explore what is working for China, and consider bringing those strategies to your own business.

Not only has the nation been the leader in the worldwide robotic market since 2013, according to the International Federation of Robotics, but it's continuing to increase those holdings. Chinese companies jumped from 25 percent market share in 2013 to 31 percent by 2016 and are predicted to reach a 40 percent market share by 2020.

China also aims to be the worldwide leader in AI by 2030. Consequently, the country has been making serious investments in this field, including the development of a $2.1 billion technology park in Beijing, according to the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

This huge investment in the future can be applied to your business, too. Despite how hectic things feel day-to-day, it's crucial to find the time to adequately prepare for future changes. Otherwise, your company will not keep up with the tide of innovation.

One study published on Emerald Insight found that Chinese managers often handle conflict by embarrassing the employee to teach a moral lesson, instead of the common American response where hostility and vengefulness are common themes.

Putting others down and employing shame is probably not the best management style in the U.S. It might also feel unnatural to take entrepreneurial advice from a country that enjoys fewer freedoms than many others. However, keep an open mind. Benefits can come from managerial attempts to teach moral lessons.

Focusing on not only tackling the single issue that caused the conflict, but trying to teach a lesson moving forward, and tying it to morals, can be an effective tactic to avoid the problem in the future and support your employees to be both better workers and citizens.

China thinks ""big"" in many senses of the word. Its goal to dominate the global economy. Its push to be the global A.I. leader and its emergence in the field of robotics are just a few examples of the scale of China's plans.

You can do the same in your business. You'll never be able to reach a dominant position in your industry by thinking and playing on a small scale. Embrace ambition and innovation to distinguish your business from a crowded market.

A 2017 Gallup study found only 41 percent of American employees strongly agree they know what their company stands for and how it stands out from competitors. In that same study, Gallup found that a 10 percent increase in an employee's connection with your company mission leads to a 12.7 percent reduction in safety incidents, an 8.1 percent decrease in turnover, and a 4.4 percent increase in profitability.",None
"The International Finance Corp (IFC) set global minimum standards for credible impact investing today at the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank Group in Bali, Indonesia by releasing a draft of its Operating Principles for Impact Management.

Impact investing, or investing with the goal of environmental and social impact in addition to financial return, is growing rapidly. The Global Impact Investing Network’s most recent estimate for the minimum size of the impact investing market doubled to $228 billion in assets under management (AUM), up from $114 billion a year earlier. Investors ranging from public pensions to private equity firms are increasingly including impact investments as part of their asset mix.

Numerous investors are using frameworks like the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to analyze how their investments link to their environmental and social goals, and numerous standard-setting organizations are working to measure and compare corporate and investor performance on their own definitions of impact. Multiple frameworks and definitions, even when each is thoughtfully developed, naturally creates confusion.

Further confounding aspiring impact investors, the line between impact investing and the rest of broader sustainable and responsible investing market is blurry. At over a quarter of global managed assets, investments in accordance with environmental, social and governance (ESG) principles have 100 times the AUM of the impact investing market and are growing 17% per year. It has been a challenge to demarcate the 1% from the 99%.

To increase clarity for investors, the IFC has been working with a range of asset owners, asset managers, and industry associations to develop market consensus around how institutional investors should manage impact investments. Organizations that commented on the Principles ranged from Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), the US government’s development finance institution, to the Rise Fund, an impact fund led by private equity firm TPG.

The comment period for “Investing for Impact: Operating Principles for Impact Management” is open, so a range of stakeholders can still opine.   The nine principles for institutional investors focused on impact investing are described below.

(i) Define strategic impact objectives for the portfolio or fund to achieve positive and measurable environmental and social goals, in alignment with the SDGs or other broadly accepted goals. Ensure consistency between the investment strategy and impact goals and proportionality between the assets under management and the magnitude of the impact.

(ii) Manage strategic impact and financial returns at the portfolio level, recognizing that impact may vary across individual investments. Consider aligning staff compensation with achieving impact and financial returns.

(iii) Establish the investor’s contribution to the achievement of impact through a credible, transparent, evidence-based narrative.

(iv) Assess and try to quantify the expected impact of each investment in advance, assess the likelihood of achieving the intended impact, and identify risk factors. The measurement framework should describe the intended impact, who experiences the impact, and how significant the impact is. Indicators should ideally conform with industry standards.

(v) Assess, address, monitor, and manage the potential negative effects of each investment. This may involve engaging with and providing support to investees.

(vi) Use the results of the framework (described in Principle iv) to monitor the progress of each investment in achieving impact against expectations and respond appropriately. The predefined monitoring process will outline data collection and reporting processes, data collection frequency, and to whom data will be reported.

(vii) Consider the effects that the timing, structure, and process of exits will have on the sustainability of the impact.

(viii) Review, document, and improve decisions and processes based on the achievement or shortfall of impact and lessons learned.

(ix) Publicly disclose alignment with the Principles annually and publicly disclose regular independent verification of the extent of alignment. The conclusions of the verification report will be subject to fiduciary and regulatory concerns.

Standing on the Shoulders of Giants

The Operating Principles for Impact Management are part of a broader trend to harmonize private sector efforts to drive positive social and environment outcomes.

The Principles complement the Impact Management Project’s framework for analyzing impact. The Impact Management Project is a network of 2,000 practitioners focused on creating shared norms for measuring, managing, and reporting impact.

The Principles also follow from the Equator Principles, a risk management framework for determining, assessing, and managing environmental and social risks in project finance that were formally launched in 2003 and are periodically updated.  The Operating Principles for Impact Management also dovetail with the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) recommendations on what types of financial disclosure help investors ascertain and respond to climate change risk.

Lastly, the Principles build on the growing importance of social issues to investment decisions globally. The rise of gender investing is one example. Shareholder resolutions at opioid manufacturers and distributors in the US and large US investors weighing in on gun violence are others.

As Leapfrog Founder and CEO Andy Kuper explained at the panel discussion that celebrated the release of the Principles, today is a day to celebrate.  Having a set of principles that defines a minimum global standard that every investor has to meet to be credible is critical to prevent “impact washing,” or the use of impact positioning to raise capital without any social or environmental benefit.  Kuper reflected on the fact that a minimum global standard for impact investors was inconceivable a decade ago. Indeed, as impact investors move from billions to trillions of AUM, armed with the Principles, together we can ensure that the trillions have impact.",None
"At the root of everything you struggle with deeply is an unhealthy attachment.

Everything you suffer over is something you are invested in being different than how it actually is, and it is something over which you do not have primary control.

Think back to what's made you most genuinely happy in life, and what consistently disappoints you.

The difference will usually be that whatever you have imagined to be your ""made it"" moment, the point in your life at which you could not fathom being anything other than happy, will always be what hurts you most. In the end, it's what you didn't expect, what you didn't bank on ""fixing"" everything, that you get the most out of. It's the successes you didn't anticipate that you enjoy the most.

Or think about it this way: When you're devastated over the end of a relationship, it's usually because you have an unhealthy attachment to what that person was going to do for your future — typically, provide a sense of security. When you are disappointed in how you look, it's because you have an unhealthy attachment to the idea that being attractive = earning love. When you find yourself stressed to the max over big life milestones that you always dreamt of reaching, it's often because you believed they would be the ultimate solution to your fear, your loneliness, your uncertainty, or your lack of direction.

The root of your problems is wanting and needing things to be some way other than what they are.

But mostly, the root of unhealthy attachment is the belief that it can somehow save you.

So how do you have goals, without having ""unhealthy attachments?""

Because if having an attachment is just the virtue of being really invested in something and putting tons of energy toward it, and visualizing and planning and mapping and getting super, precisely clear on what you want, how can you not become attached to its outcome?

The reality is that having goals and having attachments are similar, but understanding the difference will revolutionize your mental and emotional health. Here's how you start.

1. Accomplishments will not save your life.

They can be fun, and interesting, and alleviate a lot of stress and discomfort.

But accomplishments cannot save you. They cannot absolve you of all future grief or sadness or anxiety.

When you set your goals, do so because logically, you know that they will bring you a greater measure of security, fulfillment or mental peace. But do not expect them to be the solution to everything you struggle with. When you visualize your new life, do not use it as an escape mechanism for the one you have now.

2. Your goals grow in the unknown.

You have to fall in love with the unknown magic of life.

That's where everything good happens.

Having goals can make some people close-minded. They become highly attached to achieving such-and-such a thing, and don't realize that it's actually in responding to the unexpected that those goals come to life.

Making a goal is signaling to the world that you are ready to experience something new. Don't thwart it when it arrives just because it doesn't look exactly the way you thought it might.

What you have to realize is that you can be super ambitious about what you want to create and achieve, and yet, at the same time, understand that these aspects of your future life are just that — aspects. Your goals will do a lot for you, but they aren't going to save you. That work is done right here, right now, and with the tools at your disposal.

The work of truly changing how you think and feel each day is only in the present moment, in which you can work on how you think, and what you believe, and which thoughts and feelings you choose to respond to.

Chasing a new goal is like traveling to a new destination. Ultimately, the way you get there is what will account for most of your time. And once you arrive, you'll soon have to hit the road to find the Next Big Thing. As they always say: happiness is a journey, not an arrival.",
"If you ever wonder whether you have the personality to be a successful entrepreneur, you have come to the right place. That's because Stanford Graduate School of Business (GSB)  research published in January 2016 reveals a powerful insight -- startup success depends in part on a founder's ability to create professional networks and those who have open, extroverted personalities in their networks eventually produce better ideas for startups and teams

The GSB researchers studied more than 100 entrepreneurs who attended a June 2014 boot camp in New Delhi. They found that networks of peers help entrepreneurs generate ideas, find talented cofounders, and gain the skills they need to scale businesses.

Their research also found that networks could be especially useful in attempting to boost entrepreneurship in emerging markets, where entrepreneurs don't yet know the norms of startup life. GSB research also found that matching people with specific traits -- extroversion and openness -- makes networking easier, and eventually produces better ideas.

The GSB researchers asked teams of entrepreneurs to develop startup ideas for the Indian wedding industry. And they found that the quality of the ideas got better from people, especially those open to new ideas, after they were paired with extroverted people.

In a nutshell, if you are open and extroverted, you have an edge when it comes to turning your idea into a successful business. If you are closed and introverted, you may have more difficulty unless you can find a cofounder who is the opposite -- or you can train yourself to be more open and extroverted.

My interviews with hundreds of founders have taught me that when it comes to hiring cofounders, they look for people who pass two tests: they believe they will enjoy working with him or her, and the potential cofounder has excellent skills in a field that the startup needs to succeed and which the founder lacks.

Direct collaborations -- working intensively on a team together -- resulted in the most information about potential cofounders. More specifically, such collaborations revealed the strength of the interpersonal fit and the potential cofounder's talent.

Indeed such benefits of direct collaboration help explain why many of the CEOs I've interviewed started companies with people they worked with successfully in prior companies.

The benefits of direct collaboration suggests that a founder who is networking to find potential cofounders should collaborate on a project before asking them to join the startup's executive team.

The insights that such indirect connections yield regarding a potential cofounder's interpersonal ability help explain why so many of the CEOs I interviewed like to be introduced to people through a shared connection. After all, if a trusted third party makes the introduction, the risk of a poor cultural fit is reduced.

But before hiring such a person, the founder must supplement the information about interpersonal skills by investigating the potential cofounder's talent in the specific function that the cofounder will lead.

Such talent can be tested through interviews where the candidate participates in a simulation of their job coupled with deep interviews with people who have worked in similar professional settings with the candidate.

It is easy to see how such conversations could come from brief networking meetings with potential cofounders. But to discern a good personality fit, the entrepreneur might invite candidates to a dinner with the executive team or to participate in a company event -- such as a softball game or white water rafting trip.

If you have an idea, you will need to work with others to turn it into a viable business. Your odds of finding the talent you need will rise -- as will the quality of your solutions to the growth challenges you'll encounter -- if you have an open and extroverted personality.",
"Andy Bailey, an Entrepreneurs' Organization (EO) member in Nashville, is an author, CEO and head coach of business coaching firm Petra Coach who serves in an advisory role on the Gazelles Council, leaders of the Scale Up movement. We asked Andy why accountability is such a critical aspect of business. Here's what he shared:

Accountability. What do you envision when you hear the word? Standing before a stern judge, being held accountable for crimes and misdemeanors? Being called to the carpet in the boardroom for less-than-stellar earnings? If so, you're not alone: ""Accountability"" has gotten a bad rap in recent years, but it shouldn't be that way.

The best business leaders foster a company culture where accountability is celebrated and plays a crucial role in moving the team--and the enterprise as a whole--forward in positive ways. After all, if you're going to set individual and company goals and expect full participation in achieving them, then everyone from the top down must be accountable for completing specific tasks.

You see, the essence of accountability isn't about punishing mistakes. It's about giving everyone the opportunity to set goals and find success in a transparent way and with the support (and motivation) of your entire team. Being held accountable is a gift--an opportunity to shine as an individual while contributing to a larger effort. Unfortunately, as a business coach, I've seen too many leaders who make accountability a negative proposition, resulting in team members who are tentative, afraid to fail and don't bring their best ideas and energy to their work.

Effective business leaders incorporate positive accountability as part of their daily practice. When done right, it fosters a culture where individuals help each other perform better, while building trust and loyalty.

Henry Ford, one of America's greatest entrepreneurs, said, ""Failure is simply the opportunity to begin again, this time more intelligently."" The bottom line: Failure is inevitable in business. If you're not failing, you're not taking enough risk in growing your company. You can only discover your true potential by entering the discomfort zone, taking a risk and accepting responsibility for the outcome--which includes the occasional failure.

Business leaders should encourage the same attitude and action from team members. Acknowledge mistakes, but celebrate risk and encourage your employees to keep giving their all. Creating a positive attitude toward failing will help everyone on the team to take more chances.

Learning to fail the right way also provides valuable feedback, so your team is better prepared to handle future challenges. Position failures in a way that helps your team discover more about their true talents and where the company's focus should be.

Michael Jordan summed it up: ""I've failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.""

Businesses run into trouble when leaders set goals but don't clearly communicate them to the team. Without everyone on board, goals will not be reached, and the business will suffer. When team members know their goals and what they're accountable for, they will drive the company forward.

Setting--and agreeing on--SMART goals (specific, measurable, attainable, relevant and time-bound) is a key aspect of accountability. In our organization, it's a priority to make sure all team members know their goals and how they affect the company. Additionally, each associate has at least three key performance indicators (KPIs) by which outcomes are measured. This keeps everyone on track to achieve the desired results.

Success in business is the direct result of small activities--including the KPIs each person is responsible for completing--that are consistently executed over time. Giving everyone the ability to gauge their progress accurately and know what needs to happen next keeps the team moving steadily and in the right direction.

Micromanaging doesn't work. It monopolizes precious time that you should spend working on your business instead of working in your business. When you're in the weeds with day-to-day operations, you become reactive rather than proactive, and you will never move your business forward.

Trust your team. You hired great people, so step back and let them do the jobs you pay them to do. Empower them to step up and take initiative. Then, your team members will hold themselves accountable for their results and who knows? They may even do the job better than you.",
"Soda brands have fallen out of favor with many of the younger demographics, including those of the millennial and Gen Z categories. According to a Mintel study, nearly 50% of teens ages 15 to 17 agree that drinking soda is unhealthy. It’s no real surprise then that a big soda brand like Coca-Cola is being met with resistance from its younger target demographics.

Recently, Coca-Cola acquired Costa, a U.K.-based coffee chain. Many see the acquisition as a move by Coca-Cola to reach these younger consumers.

How can big brands, such as Coca-Cola, gain consumer trust -- especially with younger audiences -- when entering a new market? Read on to see how 11 members of the Forbes Agency Council answer that exact question, providing valuable insight into millennial and Gen Z marketing, as well as brand authenticity.

While entering the political arena isn't for everyone, taking a stand like Nike's recent ad with Colin Kaepernick is one idea. Consumer demographics are skewing younger and more urban. Those demographics care about causes and want to see engagement that drives change. Connect products and brands to initiatives like social justice, environmental protection and other values they hold dear. - Anne Marie Malecha, Dezenhall Resources, Ltd.

2. Let The Smaller Companies Take The Lead

Growing up as digital natives, millennials are more adept at spotting a marketing ploy than any other generation. Corporations like Coca-Cola can gain consumer trust by allowing the smaller, niche companies they acquired put their best foot forward by not being overtly involved. Let Costa be the intermediary between the corporation and the consumer.  - Brian Sullivan, Sullivan Branding

Most marketing and advertising targets are successful in their own right. Let the consumer-facing aspects continue unimpeded. Instead, focus on identifying background steps that can streamline the new-to-you SKUs or services to the market for more happy customers. Considerations include all aspects of logistics, like supply chain, trade relationships, procurement, inventory management, etc. - Kieley Taylor, GroupM

For companies like Coca-Cola to hook health-conscious people, they need to be ethical, transparent and make a positive contribution to others. With many of these companies using toxic ingredients or things that invade our privacy, they make us feel like they are exploiting basic human rights for profit. Instead, they should be on our side to make a difference to both their customers and others. - Imran Tariq, WebMetrix Group LLC

5. Meet Your Audience On Its Grounds

The first thing that comes to mind for meeting millennials where they interact the most is social media. I really think big brands are beginning to take notice of this, but they need to place even more emphasis and effort on how they are going about it. Once a big brand makes a blunder on social media, it takes a lot to recover. Do promos, giveaways and advertise with material that is engaging. - Matthew Santos, Foxtail Marketing

The question that any big brand faces, especially Coca-Cola, is: How do I remain relevant and add something meaningful -- big or small -- to the lives of my consumers? Coca-Cola is now viewing the beverage landscape more holistically, with offerings for every walk of life. Playing within the full beverage landscape is a significant evolution for the company and a smart way to increase relevance. - Meggan Wood, Innate Motion

7. Don't Rebrand If You Don't Need To

Coca-Cola already does a good job with this. It owns many healthy products that most consumers are not aware of such as Vitamin Water, Dasani and Odwalla. Nike did this when it purchased surf apparel giant Hurley, then Converse and Cole Haan. If the brand is on fire, then fan the flames; provide capital and let it do its thing. There is no need to rebrand or go through a name change. - T. Maxwell, eMaximize

8. Know What Your Market Is Looking For

Instead of asking what your new market can do for you, ask what you can do for them. Your goal is to serve your consumers and their needs. Fit their needs with messages that are authentic and success will follow. With that success, over time, you can build consumer trust and divert that halo to other efforts and brands. Become known first for being useful, and the rest will follow. - Craig Greiwe, Rogers & Cowan

Trust is gained over time through repetition. In the U.K., taxes and advertising restrictions on soft drinks limit how Coca-Cola's brands can connect with millennials. Costa opens access to caffeine-fueled youth and physical distribution for relevant Coca-Cola brands. Sponsorships, sampling and partnerships are great tactics to gain trust and exposure in your target's lifestyle in a new market. - Katie Schibler Conn, KSA Marketing + Partnerships

To get its beverages into the hands of millennials, big brands need to focus on the benefits of the drinks. Those consumers want to know what the drink will do for them. Will the drink boost their energy? Will it give them the electrolytes they need? Will they get a shot of vitamins? If the drink provides an added benefit, then it will likely be considered before other available beverages. - Henry Kurkowski, One WiFi

As big soda continues to feel the effects of millennials abandoning their core offering, they have decided to grow through acquisition. Coca-Cola's recent Costa acquisition points to how heavily big soda is invested in gaining trust among millennial consumers. In order to have their investment pay off, big soda will have to allow the brands they purchase as much independence as possible. - Mario Xavier Carrasco, ThinkNow",
"This year marks a decade since the 2008 global financial crisis. The collapse of American investment bank Lehman Brothers sparked an economic downturn which was felt throughout the entire world, particularly across Europe. The crisis has since been attributed to a range of different factors, all of which were greatly exacerbated by irresponsible behaviors exhibited by banks, specifically by way of excessive risk-taking.

With much of Europe caught in recession by the start of 2009, politicians and lawmakers across Europe rallied in the aftermath of the crash, vowing to ensure that a collapse of such magnitude could never happen again. So, what are the main ways in which the rules have changed for European banks since 2008?

The European Commission established three new supervisory bodies to oversee its new regulations, and to ensure that the European banking sector was being held properly accountable. These are the European Banking Authority (EBA), the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA).

The crash illuminated the dangerous corporate culture that had existed in banking throughout the many years that preceded it. In 2011, the UK, Germany and France all imposed sizeable levies on some of Europe’s biggest banks, in a bid to discourage them from overseeing such aggressive risk-taking in the future.

In the wake of the crisis, there were calls for bankers’ bonuses to be scrapped, because it was clear they were being rewarded for acting against the interest of their consumers. Various restrictions were imposed on the percentage of each bonus that could be paid out in cash immediately, with the remainder subject to a holding period of several years where the worthiness of the payout would be assessed. There has also been stricter vetting imposed on potential appointments at executive level across the industry, to ensure that those leading the sector understand the responsibilities of their position.

The severity of the crash was created in part because some banks were not able to pay back their customers what they owed them as that money had been used elsewhere. The crisis pervaded so widely because it involved so much consumer money that either had been lost or had to be spent on bailing the banks out.

Soon after the crisis, there were talks of mandatory ring-fencing. This has since been passed into law and will come into effect on the 1st January 2019. Essentially, banks will be required to ringfence the funds they hold as part of their retail banking branches, i.e. their customers’ savings, loans, credit cards and mortgages, and will have to keep this separate from their investment branches. This is to ensure that if a bank was close to failing again, its retail customers’ money would be safe.

The European Commission, much like the US Government, also committed to the bail-in method. This is essentially where banks commit to stabilizing a failing institution internally, rather than relying on funds from the government and, therefore, the taxpayer. The debt is shared by other creditors so that customers don’t have to fund the mistakes made by the banks themselves.

Reform and regulation within the banking industry have continued to develop over the past decade. The boom and bust cycle cannot be prevented entirely by policy and legislation, but they can be used effectively to protect consumers and taxpayers against the mistakes made by financial institutions.",
"Nourishing our physical and emotional health helps us show up as the person we need and want to be in our professional life. Cooking for ourselves is a great way to take care of our mind, body and spirit, but for so many, it feels inaccessible or complicated. To help ease kitchen intimidation and infuse some enthusiasm into your self-care routine, I spoke with Samin Nosrat, the inspiring cook, teacher and bestselling author whose new docuseries Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat, recently debuted on Netflix. Here, she talks about her own journey and dialing down the drama around cooking.

Jess Cording: Has cooking always been part of how you stay healthy?

Samin Nosrat: I really enjoy grocery shopping—it’s been part of my work for so long—but it took some conscious training for me to become a person who buys vegetable for myself. Once I got into the habit of regularly buying and having them around, though, it became a lot easier for me to cook them.

I went from a college dorm right to working in a world-class kitchen, so I never had that time where I had to figure out the basics of how to feed myself. It wasn’t until 2009 when I left that world that I began my journey of understanding what it means to be a home cook and readjust my habits like learning to shop for one person and cooking simple, healthy things for myself. Making sure my fridge has at least one or two vegetables is key for me. When I’m traveling a lot, I also stock my freezer with frozen vegetables.

I take great pleasure in cooking. I have a deep emotional experience every day when I try to write, and when I come home, even when I’m exhausted. I usually get over that hurdle and force myself to make something simple. It allows me to have a fundamental sensory experience. I put music on, I smell those good smells and I remember that I’m a human and not just a head with a computer. That’s a really restorative part of my day.

Cording: Why do you think people are intimidated by cooking?

Nosrat: We’ve lost connection to our cooking heritage. Because it’s not being normalized and passed down, it starts to feel like something that’s out of grasp, out of reach. When it doesn’t feel like something that’s available to you, it’s scary. We also have so many messages coming at us about tools and gadgets and fancy ingredients, that suddenly this thing that could be so simple starts to feel complicated.

Cording: Your book and series center on the power of salt, fat, acid, and heat. Can you speak briefly about they’re so important?

Nosrat: They are, as I understand it, the building blocks of deliciousness. Salt enhances flavor. Fat carries flavor and helps us achieve the right texture. Acid is an incredibly underused tool—it creates contrast and makes food pop. Heat gives us transformation. It brings our food from raw to cooked.

Cording: What’s one simple recipe you think everyone should master to make their life easier?

Nosrat: It’s making a pot of beans. And if that feels too hard, there’s opening a can of beans, rinsing and draining it and making it delicious with spices and a few other ingredients. It becomes a base for meals for several days.

Cording: Is there anything you wish you’d known about health and wellness at the beginning of your career?

Nosrat: I wish I had prioritized sleep earlier in my life. Only in the past few years have I become protective of my sleep. It’s also been a journey for me to become a person who packs my day with vegetables, but now I often I eat salad with breakfast–or as breakfast. It’s like insurance.

Cording: What are some foods you rely on to keep your energy up on a busy day?

Nosrat: I’ll make trail mix with just enough fruit and chocolate to make it delicious but without me needing to worry I’ll eat the whole package. At the office, I also have a jar of almond butter as well as pickles and string cheese. One of my favorite snacks is a medjool date I split open, pit and put almond butter in. I try to bring lunch—often leftovers from the night before. A big part of my learning to be a home cook was starting to work in an office with 15 other writers and seeing what non-chef humans brought for lunch. I would see people bring salad greens topped with whatever was in their fridge and just—wow! They don’t even know how much they taught me. It doesn't have to be fancy to be good.",
"Gone are the days of the master training the apprentice. Today’s business is about collaboration and mutual mentorship, where colleagues help each other regardless of age, gender or title. Mutual mentoring enables us to contribute our ideas and learn from the experiences of others. Mentors also are your best sales force because they have a stake in your success. Mutual mentors have each other’s backs.

Most professionals are driven to learn, grow and improve themselves. The evidence is the millions of views TED Talks and YouTube’s instructional videos tally online, the vast array of educational webinars and business books, not to mention the entire coaching industry. All these paths support personal career growth.

One of the most impactful learning experiences happens by connecting with people and turning an internal monologue into a dialogue.

Here are four inspiring examples of mutual mentoring:

One would expect bad blood between Don Graham, former CEO of the Washington Post, born in 1945, and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who was born in 1984. In 2005, Zuckerberg passed on Graham’s offer of a $6 million investment in favor of a better offer. But the two built a mutually beneficial relationship based on respect for each other’s business prowess. Zuckerberg benefited from Graham’s many years of experience, and Graham got valuable advice for online engagement strategies from Zuckerberg. Today, their mutual mentorship led to Graham becoming Facebook's lead director.

Many people forget about the untapped wisdom in their own network of relationships. There are opportunities for growth all around us, often within your own office. Understand that there are five generations in today’s workforce. This diversity of age provides a plethora of perspectives on employee experience from technology disruption to changes in office culture.

As boomers near the end of their employment, Generation Z is just starting to enter the workforce and each generation is learning from the other. Boomers in the workforce have adapted and learned that the best way to reach a millennial is via text, not a phone call. Never in our history has such a diverse workforce had to share space and learn to work and play well together. The problem is that generations have traditionally been insular and, as a result, their wisdom was buried. There is not always a clear path for older professionals to share their insight with a younger executive nor for the up-and-coming workers to share technology shortcuts for streamlining efficiencies. But these lines are blurring, and smart leaders encourage a cross-generational mentorship that’s good for everyone.

A mutual mentor may be just across the hall. Employees who are new to the company bring a fresh set of eyes to the organization, and employees who have years of experience provide context and historical insight. Success results when these two groups develop a mutual mentorship arrangement.

No one will know the company’s values, style and processes better than someone from your own company. Colleagues are a great source of wisdom and insights. They may be from an entirely different function, practice area or seniority level, yet can understand the company culture and offer a different perspective on how to handle company politics, manage a difficult project or identifying the change agent in the organization.

It is a safe space to share difficulties and even failures when you’re on the same team as a mentor. Challenges are inevitable, but being open about these kinds of experiences strengthens the relationships between colleagues and helps build resiliency in an organization.

Entrepreneur Robert Herjavec of “Shark Tank” shared how other ""sharks"" on the TV show from different industries practice a form of mutual mentoring by providing feedback and business advice with each other. “The sharks have encouraged me to think bigger and take more risks in business,” said Herjavec.

People from different industries bring a fresh perspective. Compiling insights and wisdom from different industries can help with situations and stages of growth that are universal to many businesses, such as negotiating a challenging contract, handling a vendor problem or communicating with a difficult boss.

Our company's group leaders organize monthly troikas where three people from different professions — i.e., an attorney, an accountant, a marketing expert — have lunch. What do they talk about? Universal client issues like techniques for building their practices, ideas for who to work with for digital marketing or strategies for an efficient executive search. Members say the troikas are a vital benefit.

Sometimes the best mentorships are those that are never defined as such. I read about how Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, the second- and fourth-wealthiest people on the planet, have been friends and each other’s mentor for 27 years. Since they met in 1991, they’ve not only helped each other prosper financially, but Gates also wrote that ""Warren has helped us [Bill and Melinda] do two things that are impossible to overdo in one lifetime: learn more and laugh more.""",
"Face it: None of us like to admit we’re wrong. I’ve been a sports official for over 30 years, working every level from peewee football to college baseball and football. Over those years, I’ve literally made thousands of game-impacting decisions, with probably 98% of them being correct. Unfortunately, no matter how hard you study the rules, review game film and hustle on the field to get in position, even the most competent officials make mistakes. Thankfully, because of instant replay, many of the most egregious errors are corrected with a simple phrase: “After further review …”

As business leaders, we make critical decisions daily, ranging from simple things such as setting meeting agendas to more impactful calls related to vision, strategy and people. The most successful leaders get it right all the time — except for when we don’t. So, the question becomes: how do we handle a leadership error? Here are four keys to help turn that mistake into an opportunity.

Be Open To New Information

When a member of our college football officiating crew thinks someone has missed a call, they simply say, “I have information you need.” This is important because in order to make correct decisions, we need all the information.

Unfortunately, leaders are often blinded by their egos, causing them to miss important factors related to their decisions. Successful leaders must be willing to receive all relevant information, even if it’s inconvenient or painful. This involves setting aside the “win at all cost” mentality and developing intentional listening skills so we can accurately process the facts. Most critically, when faced with new information, we must be open to the possibility that we’ve made an error. Remember, correct decisions can't be made unless we have all the information.

Once it’s clear you’ve made an error, simply own it. Too many leaders blame their mistakes on outside circumstances or other team members. At best, this is short-sighted, and at worst, undermines your authenticity and credibility.

Several years ago, on the last play of a rivalry football game, I ruled a catch was completed for the game-winning touchdown. After reviewing game video, it was obvious I had made a major mistake that cost a team an important win. I immediately called the head coach and apologized for my error.

Did it change the outcome of the game? No, but the coach was genuinely appreciative of my honesty and commitment to excellence. That simple phone call also resulted in a long friendship that continues to this day. The same is true in our professional lives. Acknowledging mistakes may not change the impact of a decision, but it can help lay a foundation for trust and respect moving forward.

Our mistakes can teach us a lot — if we let them. Legendary Alabama football coach Paul “Bear” Bryant said, “When you make a mistake, there are only three things you should ever do about it: admit it, learn from it, and don't repeat it.”

I believe great leaders are forged in the crucible of failure. As a result, when faced with an error, leaders must ask, “Why did this happen?” Answering this question requires an honest evaluation of our decision-making process, contributing factors influencing the decision and our underlying motivations. Most importantly, once we answer the question, we must identify steps to ensure it doesn’t happen again. All leaders make mistakes. Great leaders simply don’t repeat them.

After an error, we have to intentionally decide to move on.

In the third inning of a collegiate championship baseball game, I called a third strike to end the inning. I knew I blew it. The batter knew I blew it. The manager knew I blew it. In fact, everyone in the ballpark knew the pitch was low and outside. I was embarrassed and frustrated to have made such a visible error in such an important game. In that moment, however, I was faced with a choice. Two-thirds of the game remained to be played and I needed to regroup. After a brief, albeit slightly heated conversation with the manager, I put on my face mask, resumed my position behind the plate, and went on to call a pretty solid game.

You see, sports officials aren’t afforded the luxury of shutting down after an error, and the same is true for leaders. When faced with an error, leaders must find ways to recalibrate mentally and physically in order to be effective on the next play. Sports officials often remind each other we’re not defined by our last call — and we’re only as good as our next call. This also is true for leaders. The stakes are too high because another decision is coming. We must move on because we can’t afford to blow the next decision as well.

When confronted with possible errors, leaders must embrace an attitude of humility, allowing them to be open to important information that might have been initially missed. Once this information is processed, leaders must be willing to admit the mistake, learn from it and move on, better prepared for the next opportunity.

I speak from experience. Over the years, I’ve reversed a few calls on the athletic field, as well as in my personal and professional life. Because of these experiences, I was able to grow and improve as a sports official, a person and a leader. Most importantly, in every one of these instances, the reversal resulted in getting the call right. That’s worth remembering, because, after all, shouldn’t that be our goal in the first place?",
"2018 has been the year of the woman. Women are rising. Women are harnessing their outrage. They are more engaged, energized and resolute than ever.

Issues that were long ignored are finally coming to the surface, and women are beginning to speak up and use their voices and influence to demand real change. It becomes increasingly important to harness this collective power and create a positive uplifting movement to create real change. Millions joined the Women's March around the world, and more women are bravely coming forward with their stories of harassment and assault and bullying in the workplace.

""Women's movement"" is becoming more diverse, and we are increasingly talking about intersectional feminism. Social media is being used to mobilize women, celebrate women, and talk about women's rights. It is especially effective at mobilizing the next generation of women and girls and share positive messages, talks, and campaigns from around the world. Social media platform is also used to mobilize communities of ""girl tribes"" and create a feeling of ""sisterhood"". This year TEDxWomen theme is ""Showing Up"", and a number of TEDxWomen events around the world in November and December are using their platform to encourage women to stand up together, as in unity lies strength. Merriam-Webster dictionary defines ""sisterhood""  as the solidarity of women based on shared conditions, experiences, or concerns.

Femnesty is an innovative global networking platform that aims to connect women, women's groups and women in businesses all around the world; a platform for sisterhood. Farah Brown, founder, and CEO of Femnesty says that ""Women can face different challenges to men as we strive to be great mothers, loving partners, and valued employees. We often have to make sacrifices, personally and professionally, to achieve financial independence as well as all the goals we set out to achieve. These experiences shape us, but they also make us stronger.""  The overall goal is to connect different kinds of women from all over the world- wives, mothers, partners, students, CEOs, apprentices, entrepreneurs or employees – and enable them to share thoughts, strengths, and strategies.

The idea for Femnesty first came to Farah in 2012 when she first noticed a lack of self-belief and conviction in many women working with her and around her. Her market research showed that there was no integrated networking platform enabling women to collaborate, share and empower each other in one unified and secure space. She worked on this platform while bringing up her two daughters, now two and three years old, and while in a full-time corporate position.

Femnesty welcomes women as individuals, groups, clubs or through their corporate Partner scheme. Members can connect globally using their online platform, or locally by attending one of their events. On the platform, the members can read and share stories, and find help and inspiration through the extensive collection of books, TED Talks, and videos. Femnesty is releasing new features on weekly basis to enable the best experience for the member community, and have just released their apps for Android and iOS.

It is important that we talk not only about the achievements and success stories, but also the challenges that women face at home and in the workplace, and particularly in balancing career and finding employment. It is through sharing these diverse stories that we can start creating more opportunities for women in the workplace. It is also important that honest experiences will highlight stories of bias and discrimination that women face every day.

A sense of community is also important for a movement like this to become more than just a social media buzzword. It is important that it motivates young women into taking more positive action.",
"We are at the beginnings of a new industrial revolution that will not only fundamentally transform most industries and businesses but will also have a wide-reaching impact on our careers. This new 4th industrial revolution will bring change and innovation at an unprecedented rate, fuelled by technological advancements like artificial intelligence, machine learning, big data, the internet of things and more.

Businesses need to be agile to react to rapidly changing technology and ways of doing business, so who they need on their team today might be drastically different to who they will need in even the very near future. This has led to a more flexible approach to workforce planning where businesses dynamically create teams with the talent they need for a period of time, often composed of a flexible internal workforce and contractors who come in for one project and then leave again. This gives businesses the flexibility they need to adapt to changing business needs, expand and contract as business dictates, and recruit individuals with the particular skill-set and technical know-how they require for a project. We often refer to this new environment as the gig economy and I believe we will see a shift from long-term employment to shorter-term more flexible gigs.

According to a report from LinkedIn, it’s likely that millennials will hold twice as many jobs by the time they are 30 years old than their colleagues who are 10 years older.  Regardless of whether you are a freelancer or a full-time employee of an organization, I believe that as a result of this change, individuals must treat their careers more like a business of which they are the CEO. The professionals that behave like any effective CEO and prepare and train to be able to supply the skills and resources customers and businesses seek are going to be in command of their professional futures. These employees are those that have an eye on the horizon for upcoming opportunities.

This new reality is enabled by the explosion of internet-based resources that make it easy for anyone to acquire skills in any discipline quickly and cheaply. It means more people have access to essential training than ever before and those that want to forge out on their own can make it happen with the help of abundant free (or cheap) education. It’s those workers that take advantage of these resources who will set themselves up for success. Plus, data-powered career and employment sites fueled by rich data streams make it easier to know and compare the opportunities and rewards available to us.

How committed are you to upgrading your skills and knowledge? There are several learning opportunities that you can take advantage of now to enhance your skill-set to keep you marketable for the changing economy. Here are a few:

Corporations who want to invest in flexible continuing education for their workers from colleges find value with online educational programs such as those offered from ExecOnline. This type of service opens the door to professional development programs from top colleges, but doesn’t require people to leave the office for extended periods of time.

If the shift for businesses to rely more on contractors rather than full-time personnel is going to work out, there will need to be changes in the way highly skilled talent and those businesses who need them find each other. That’s where businesses such as Toptal come in. This is a network of top-tier talent—developers, designers and financial experts—all screened and verified with a language and personality test, test screenings and test projects. This gives companies a chance to work with freelancers and contractors without any risk at all.

With the power of more than 1 million coders, designers, data scientists and algorithmists at your disposal through the services of Topcoder, organizations have the ability to deliver faster solutions to their tech issues. Through its crowdsourcing marketplace, Topcoder has helped develop and design apps, cognitive solutions, analytics and more quickly and effectively to help businesses get ready for the challenges of tomorrow.

When you consider all the learning you can access from some of the world’s top universities with just an internet connection, it’s simply incredible. These are free college-level courses on sites such as Coursera, edX and Khan Academy. Although at the end of the courses you will receive certificates of achievement rather than course credits or grades, this is still marketable education and HR executives and recruiters see these certificates as proof of your commitment to upgrading skills and knowledge.

Take charge of your professional development like you’re the CEO of your professional future, because you are. Professionals who show that they are commitment to skills acquisition and personal development will be those poised to be the resources needed by tomorrow’s businesses.",
"U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) claims it has the authority to limit the duration of an H-1B visa to any length it believes appropriate. As a result, employers report receiving visa approvals that last for as little as one day, 12 days or, quite amazingly, even expire before they receive them. The chaos this has created for many employers has prompted people to ask a reasonable question: Does USCIS actually possess the authority to limit how long H-1B professionals can work on an H-1B visa? A new lawsuit may answer this question.

Current USCIS policy is producing absurd results, such as employers receiving petitions that have already expired by the time they are received in the mail. In one exhibit in the lawsuit (which can be found here), USCIS approved and mailed out an approval for an H-1B petition on August 29, 2018. However, the H-1B was only valid from June 15, 2018 to August 10, 2018, meaning the H-1B petition expired almost 3 weeks before it was mailed out to the employer.

Some companies are finding it difficult to operate their businesses in a rational way. “These companies are caught in a cycle of constantly applying for extension petitions and paying the filing and attorney fees, and as soon as the petitions are getting an approval, then the companies have to immediately turn around and file a new extension, because the approval is good for only a few weeks or months,” , the attorney who filed the new lawsuit, told me in an interview. “USCIS is claiming the authority, in essence, to pick at random how long an H-1B petition is approved. This is a major problem because it is almost impossible to run a business when you don't know if you're going to have your employees for any reasonable period of time.”

Companies and attorneys have told me they are now regularly getting approvals that last 6 months or less. “It happens all the time,” attorney Vic Goel told me, particularly with any company providing information technology services. “We are getting approvals of 6 months or less,” said attorney Dagmar Butte. “We have to immediately turn around and file an extension, which means more legal fees and filing fees and less certainty for the beneficiary and the company.”

Current USCIS regulations say that an H-1B petition can be approved for 3 years, or less if the employer requests it, argues the plaintiff, while there is nothing in the regulation that says USCIS can set a period of validity of less than 3 years for other reasons. (USCIS can grant an extension beyond 6 years if an employment-based green card application is pending, under the law.)

Although lawyers have cited past cases of short approval periods, the problem became widespread starting on February 22, 2018, after USCIS released a policy memorandum that asserted it possessed the authority to limit how long an H-1B petition is valid: “While an H-1B petition may be approved for up to three years,” the memo stated, “USCIS will, in its discretion, generally limit the approval period to the length of time demonstrated that the beneficiary will be placed in non-speculative work and that the petitioner will maintain the requisite employer-employee relationship, as documented by contracts, statements of work, and other similar types of evidence.”

The new lawsuit, ITServe Alliance v. USCIS, asks a district court to determine, among other things, if the immigration agency is exceeding its authority and violating the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) by setting these short validity periods for H-1B petitions. “There is no legal justification for why USCIS is doing these short approval periods and the legal justification the agency cites doesn’t hold up,” said Jonathan Wasden.

The two sources of authority USCIS cites to impose short approval periods are the January 1990 “itinerary rule,” which predated the H-1B designation in the Immigration Act of 1990, and a 1998 proposed rule that never became final after Congress adopted a contrary position. “Defendant cites these two sources as authority when it demands employers provide exact itineraries showing when and where employees will perform work over the course of the entire H-1B visa,” according to the plaintiff’s complaint. “However, the itinerary regulation was promulgated prior to the passing of the 1990 INA [Immigration and Nationality Act] and has no applicability to the H-1B visa. In addition, the regulatory choices in the 1998 Proposed Rule were abrogated by statute, and never finalized.”

It is fascinating that in the 1998 proposed rule (that USCIS cites as authority to impose short approval periods) its predecessor, the INS, noted the 1990 itinerary rule (that the agency now also cites) was not practical for health care staffing and information technology companies, noting, “. . .  complete itineraries listing the dates and places of the alien’s employment, the Service recognizes such an across-the-board requirement is no longer practical in today’s business environment.”

The plaintiff’s complaint also notes the 1998 proposed rule was intended to address “benching,” when an H-1B worker is brought to the U.S. but put on the “bench” and does not work, and is not paid if a project is unavailable. The American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act of 1998 (ACWIA) included a simple legislative solution to the problem of “benching”: It required employers to pay an H-1B professional the required wage whether or not work was available. (I worked on the Senate Immigration Subcommittee during the bill and recalled this was a solution everyone agreed made sense.)

“Defendant’s 1998 Proposed Rule with its prohibition on speculative H-1B filings ran counter to the intent of Congress,” states the plaintiff’s complaint. “Consequently, it was never finalized.” The complaint also notes, “Despite its admission in the June 4, 1998 Proposed Rule that the itinerary regulation was ultra vires [beyond its legal authority], Defendant continues to demand that H-1B employers must provide a complete itinerary with the petition.”

Conservative supporters point to Trump administration efforts at “deregulation,” but it would be difficult to find a federal agency in recent memory that uses as heavy a regulatory hand against business as today’s USCIS. The agency’s regulatory agenda and its numerous policy memos are aimed at making it more difficult for employers to utilize what is generally the most important resource for a business – productive human talent.

“There’s a measure of arrogance that has enabled USCIS to tacitly expand its authority to serve as judge, jury and executioner when it comes to H-1B petitions that involve third-party work locations,” said attorney Vic Goel. “Because most businesses cannot wait the extended time that an appeal or lawsuit will entail, these arbitrary decisions have been largely unchallenged for years, thereby emboldening the agency.” He said that since USCIS is funded by user fees, it has an incentive to continue practices that generate additional millions of dollars in filing fees.

Looking past the legal arguments, this case is ultimately about the freedom of employers to be relieved of arbitrary rules designed, it appears, for the purpose of making it more difficult to run their businesses. More important, at stake is whether a government agency can make up rules – without regard to its own regulations or U.S. law.",
"No matter what industry you are in if you want to achieve great things you need to learn how to lead. Good leaders can boost motivation and productivity. Great leaders know how to inspire their peers and subordinates, they know how to create momentum in both celebratory times and difficult times.

Whether you're a long time CEO, a new founder, or an activist, leadership is a skill that you will continually need work at. It's a tool your should prioritze, and value. I had the opportunity to sit down with Deray Mckesson, a civil rights activist and supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement. I picked his brain about the makings of a good leader. He explained that good leaders from all walks of life should have these three qualities.

1. Being a good leader means empowering the people who follow you.

Leaders are who people look to for guidance and motivation. They are an authoritative voice, which is why they should choose their words wisely. When you're founding a company, you don't have a lot of proof that your idea can be sustainable, or that it can make revenue. First-time founders don't even have proof that they can be entrepreneurs. Which is why their passion and their leadership is so vital to their startup.

If you just started a company, as a leader, it is your job to empower your team. And to create a motivating company culture where your employees can thrive. Mckesson says:

The best leaders both identify gifts and talents of other people and help them live in those gifts and talents. They create space for that to happen. And the second thing is that they help people see a world that they have not seen before and help them feel comfortable that they can live in that, that they can create it. That they can build it.

This is as true for activists on the front line as it is for entrepreneurs working with cutting edge technology. To create a movement, as a leader you should enable your peers and subordinates to achieve and to use their talents to be great.

Most importantly, leaders should share their vision with their team. When you look at the Elon Musk's, Nelson Mandela's, and Bill Gate's of the world, you see people who pursued their dream of what the world could be. And they do this by sharing this with a team of people, and empowering them to help them build it.

2. Good leaders take risks to have fulfilled big dreams and achieve tangible efforts.

Mckesson believes that ""The best leaders are able to dream in ways that feel tangible."". Leaders have to balance unthinkable and innovative ideas, with palpable goals. They create change by wanting it, and by doing something about it. Still, most innovators and entrepreneurs understand that a large amount of risk can be involved when you're trying to leave your mark on the world.

In DeRay Mckesson's book On The Other Side of Freedom he challenges this idea. He explains that everybody has the ability to pursue their big dreams, and everyone can create a magical thing. It's the people who are willing to put in the work and a willingness to walk into the risks that end up achieving their dreams.

As an entrepreneur success doesn't happen overnight. It involves lots of failures, sleepless nights and risk. It means quitting your day job to go all in on your side hustle. Which is why sometimes being a great leader, starts with leading yourself to greatness.

When Jeff Bezos started Amazon, it didn't seem like that plausible of an idea. The internet was fairly new, and e-commerce had yet to become an industry. He started with an online bookstore and grew it into an online store that sells everything.

Mckesson's book explains that leaders should start small and when they see a problem and do something about it. He went from being a school teacher to being a civil rights activist by doing just that.",
"Bosses come in many varieties, each of which must be handled differently. All varieties, however, are human beings and therefore appreciate sincere compliments from their employees.

However, there is one compliment that you should never offer to any boss, regardless of whether they're a raging narcissist or a brilliant coach or anything in-between. That compliment is: ""I like working here.""

That sentence is a compliment when it tells bosses that they've successfully created an environment that, in your case at least, has resulted in high morale. In many ways, ""I like working here"" is the highest praise a boss can receive.

Nevertheless, you should never, ever express that exact sentiment to your boss. It's OK to say something like ""I think you're a great manager"" or even ""I like my job"" or indeed express positive feelings about your career and your relationship with your boss.

But saying ""I like working here"" is flushing money down the toilet and here's why. Regardless of how much you feel that your boss is your friend and ally, one of your boss's primary responsibilities is determining where money gets spent.

Expressing that you're receiving positive emotional rewards simply because you're doing your job at your current and at your current location communicates to your boss that you're not at all looking to leave for greener pastures.

And that's something you never want your boss to think, because when it comes to handing out raises, the fact that you're basically happy (as expressed by your ill-considered compliment) implies that you're willing to accept less compensation than otherwise might be the case.

Ideally, you want your boss to perceive you as a unique resource whose continued presence is dependent upon being paid what you're worth. Implicit in that perception is that notion that, is that you'll leave to work elsewhere if that's not the case.

When you say something like ""I like working here,"" you're implying that you're satisfied with your compensation (and everything else) and are therefore less likely to leave, even if offered more money to work elsewhere.

There's a larger principle here, though, that applies to every career: which is that doing what you love makes it hard to demand (and receive) what you're actually worth.

I recently had a conversation with an unbelievably smart woman who'd created a consulting service so effective that she was literally turning customers away. However, when I gave her my standard advice for this situation--raise your price--I sensed an emotional reluctance to do so.

The root of that reluctance, I think, was that she loved her job so much that she was grateful for the opportunity to do it, and that was preventing her from charging what she was worth, which was (incidentally) many times what she was charging.

Seriously, one of the biggest hazards that people face when the ""follow their bliss"" or ""pursue their passion"" is letting their love of the job get in the way of making money--let alone big money--doing it.

So here's a rule of thumb: if you're being offered a job or a contract or up for your salary review, never start--as many do--with the internal question: ""what's the minimum  I'd accept?"" Instead start with the question: ""how much am I worth?"" Then make your demands accordingly.",
"How do you start your morning? Do you hit snooze a few times, hoping to catch a few more minutes of rest before the demands of the day take over? Do you check social media? Or maybe you're someone who showers and eats breakfast. How we start our mornings can feel very...routine. Often, we're running on auto-pilot, just going through the motions so we can get on with our day. But what we do in the morning plays a huge role in what we can accomplish.

There's a reason why Apple CEO Tim Cook wakes up at 4am to read email and Michele Obama rises at 4:30 a.m for a workout. A structured morning routine cultivates success. Harvard Biologist Christoph Randler discovered that early risers are more proactive. They're also more likely to anticipate problems and minimize them efficiently, which leads to more success especially in the business world. Having a proactive mindset leads to increased productivity because you're not standing by waiting to be told what to do next or how to handle a challenge. Instead you're anticipating needs, getting curious, and building confidence.

But increased productivity isn't the only bonus to getting up early, you'll also be happier. According to a University of Toronto study, morning people reported higher levels of happiness. Considering the link between happiness and work performance, it's no wonder morning people feel happier than their night owl counterparts.

Check off the hardest thing on your to-do list first

First thing in the morning is often the quietest. You're not being bombarded with phone calls or meetings. So now's the perfect time to tackle the project that is of most importance to you. You're mental reserves are high, and you'll be most focused. You'll also gain a sense of accomplishment and purpose before 10 a.m.

You might have heard this one already, but there's actual science that supports working out in the morning as more than just an easy way to get it over with. According to Harvard Medical School's journal, working out causes your brain to secrete a chemical called neurotrophic factor, which boosts brain function. Exercising in the morning increases your mental and physical stamina, provides energy and boosts motivation, leading to increased overall productivity.

Plan your routine the night before

Often we only discover what we need to do in a day at the end of said day. So why not take this info and use it as ammunition. Before you go to bed, try writing down 3 things that you need to accomplish the next morning. It can be anything - calling your friend to say happy birthday, paying off a bill, or sending project highlights from your latest deal. When you wake up the next morning, make sure you do all 3 of those things before you do anything else. Not only will you feel a great sense of accomplishment, but the rest of the day will be much more productive.",
"Losing a job isn't a pleasant experience, but being wrongfully terminated is even more painful. If you believe your employer illegally fired you, you've got some choices to make. You can do nothing, file a claim with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), hire an attorney or file a claim and hire that attorney.

Take, for instance, the case of a company that fired a man after he refused to participate in an employee Christian bible study group. He claimed that his boss said participation was mandatory. When he didn't join, the boss fired him. He filed a discrimination charge against the company with the EEOC and hired an attorney.

In another recent case, employees at a large tech company filed a class-action lawsuit claiming the company discriminated against them because of their age when it fired them.

If you believe you were wrongfully terminated or not hired for the wrong reasons, you're not powerless. Title VII of The Civil Rights Act of 1964 lays out protected classes in employment and defines illegal practices. The EEOC exists to help people like you, and many attorneys focus their practices on seeking justice for those fired or not hired for illegal reasons. Rounding out this three-part series on Title VII, here's what you need to know regarding the rights of a wrongfully terminated employee.

Employers cannot consider your protected class in hiring.

When interviewing for a job, you expect to be asked questions. Employers need to learn about you, your skills and experience. But they don't need to know anything about topics that potentially place you in a protected class. Some of these questions may be common get-to-know-you queries, but they're not appropriate — or legal — in a job interview. Those topics include:

If anyone asks you about any of the above topics in a job interview, you don't have to answer.

Sometimes the illegal questions aren’t direct. For example, a job candidate listed fluency in Spanish on her resume. The interviewer then asked where she learned the language, a seemingly innocent question that’s actually an attempt to determine her national origin.

You have the right to receive all the benefits anyone should receive after being terminated.

When you're fired — no matter the reason — you have the right to receive some benefits. These include:

• Final paycheck: You have the right to be paid for the time you worked.

• Healthcare coverage: Under COBRA (the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986) you and your family have the right to continued health insurance coverage after being fired, for a period.

• Severance pay: If you have a severance agreement as part of your employment contract, you may be eligible for that pay.

• Unemployment: You have the right to file for unemployment. If approved, you can receive benefits for 26 weeks, and possibly an additional 20 weeks. Conditions apply.

When should you pursue legal action?

If your employer, or potential employer, used your protected class when making decisions about hiring, disciplinary actions or firing, you might have grounds for a lawsuit. Some examples of discriminatory behavior that may be a reason to file a lawsuit include:

• Two employees commit a similar offense. One employee doesn't face any consequences. The other employee, a member of a protected class, is demoted.

• An employer makes the work environment intolerable for a person of a protected class, essentially forcing the person to resign.

• An employee is harassed because of her protected class or because she complained about discrimination.

These are only some examples of instances where an employer discriminated against an employee.

What should you do next?

If you believe an employer didn't hire you, fired you or took disciplinary action against you because of your protected class, you have choices. But first, remember that anti-discrimination laws give you a limited window to file. Generally, you must file within 180 days from when the discrimination happened.

If you want to take action, you need to start with the EEOC. Except for the Equal Pay Act, you must file a charge with the EEOC before you can file a lawsuit against an employer for unlawful discrimination. The EEOC allows you to file a charge online, in person, by phone or by mail. If the employer is part of the federal government, there is a different filing process.

Title VII of the Civil Rights Act designates protected classes in employment. As an employee or job applicant, you need to know that employers can't consider those classes in hiring, that you have the right to benefits when you've been fired, whether you have grounds for legal action after being terminated and what to do if you think an employer discriminated against you.",
"You know that employee who is always keen to lend a hand--even when her plate is already filled with one task too many? Chances are you have an ""Obliger"" in your midst.

Obligers are people who thrive on meeting other people's expectations of themselves, but struggle with their own. They represent one of of four personality types--the others are Upholders, Questioners, and Rebels--identified by author Gretchen Rubin in her book The Four Tendencies. Speaking at the 2018 Inc. 5000 conference in San Antonio, Rubin explained how these personality types are determined by the way people respond to inner and outer expectations, and how they manifest in the workplace.

Questioners, she said, will only meet outer expectations--what other people count on them to do--if it matches their inner beliefs (how they view themselves), Upholders are great at meeting both inner and outer expectations, while Rebels, well, ""rebel"" against all expectations and resist meeting them.

Obligers are the most common personality type in the world, Rubin said, so odds are you probably have a few of them in your team. Because they're great at keeping up with others' expectations of them, they often make great partners, teammates, and employees. But while there are many benefits to Obliger employees, there's also a heightened risk that they'll burn out from continually saying ""yes"" to new projects and tasks even when they don't want to do them.

If this goes on for too long, it could lead to something Rubin dubbed ""Obliger rebellion,"" which happens when an Obliger feels disrespected or unheard, and their defense mechanism is to shun a co-worker or quit their job. As a manager, you need to make sure you are always aware of how your Obliger employees are doing, she said.

Rubin, who is a self-proclaimed Upholder, cited an example from her own work experience. She tends to respond to emails during the weekend, she said, simply because that's when she has time to do it. Although she doesn't expect anyone to reply at that time, one of her Obliger employees grew increasingly resentful because she felt the need to respond right away and it interfered with her weekend. The solution, Rubin said, was to use a delayed delivery system. Now when Rubin writes an email on Saturday, it will get sent Monday morning.

""It's not that one person is right and one person is wrong,"" she explained. ""It's about how we can create an environment that works for both of us, so that we can both thrive.""

If you have Obliger employees, keep an eye on their workload and effort to distribute projects evenly, Rubin recommended. Encourage them to use their vacation time too, she added, by creating the expectation that they need to take time off to recharge.",
"Dennis Shea, the U.S. ambassador to the World Trade Organization, said WTO reform proposals offered by other members were the direct result of U.S. “leadership.”

“The discussions of WTO reform would not have happened, but for the constructive leadership of the United States,” he said during a public forum Oct. 12 at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C.

“Without the U.S. speaking up, I don’t think the reform efforts at the WTO would have been initiated at all. I think we would be still sleep-walking at the WTO. But since the United States has been pressing these issues, people there have begun to realize that there is a desperate need for reform,” Shea said.

He flatters himself. WTO members, including the United States, have been working for many years to reform various WTO rules and processes. They just haven’t been using the blunderbuss approach that Trump and Shea favor.

Trump has repeatedly threatened to withdraw the United States from the WTO if it doesn’t “shape up.” No WTO member has ever withdrawn. His administration continues to black-ball judicial appointments and re-appointments to the WTO’s Appellate Body. And he complains that the United States rarely wins cases it files in the Dispute Settlement Body, which is patently false.

Shea might be right that other WTO members are trying to build consensus around reform proposals in response to U.S. leadership, but it is leadership meant to scare, not to inspire. It’s leadership Darth Vader style.

Canada and the European Union have produced similar WTO reform proposals. Canada has also released a nine-page paper to be discussed at a conference of invited WTO members in Ottawa, Oct. 24 and 25. Canadian Trade Minister Jim Carr said his government had invited “like-minded nations from all over the world” to attend. The United States was not invited.

“I think the whole tenor of the (Canadian) paper is trying to be a more middle-of-the-road approach and let’s have more discussions, let’s start discussions,” Shea said of the Canadian proposal. “Yes, discussions are important, dialogue is important, but we need to get some actions.”

That statement may explain why Shea reportedly hasn’t talked to his counterparts from other WTO member countries about the United States’ dissatisfaction with the Appellate Body.

“The situation is unusual in that there has been no meaningful engagement to my knowledge between the United States and other WTO members on working out a solution,” said WTO Deputy Director General in a Oct. 15 speech at the Council on Foreign Relations. “Rather, the U.S. has listed problems it believes to exist with the conduct of the Appellate Body, its decisions and its processes. But it has not stated what the solution is that it could accept.”

Asked for a response, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative referred to Shea’s remarks of Oct. 12.

The action the Trump administration has taken against the Appellate Body is to refuse to allow the appointment or reappointment of its judges. There are seven judicial seats on the AB and four of vacant, thanks to Trump and Shea. One of the three remaining judges will reach the end of his term in 2019. If he leaves and is not replaced, the AB will have to shut down, because three judges sit on every case.

Trump supporters will point out that the Obama administration refused to allow the reappointment of one appellate judge from South Korea in 2016 and was roundly castigated for it by other WTO members. That may have been unjustified, but it was not an existential threat to the AB.

Trump and Shea consider themselves men of action. They have no patience for the tedium of protracted negotiations. This may play well with Trump’s political base, but discussions and negotiations are how trade policy is made.",None
"Judge Merrick Garland is a judicial phantom limb. He never sat on the Supreme Court, but he is missed almost as if he had. Merrick Garland nostalgia was especially acute when a photo of his yearbook page recently surfaced.

The themes that emerged from his high school years were an interest in public service (School Board Representative, Student Council, Political Forum Club), science (Forensics, Science Seminar), acting (Thespians, Pygmalion, Guys & Dolls), and unquestionable acumen (Illinois State Scholarship, National Merit Semi-Finalist, Harvard Alumni Book Award, National Honor Society).

While high school is not always representative of future careers, in Merrick Garland’s case, it is illustrative.

Garland was the valedictorian of his high school class, after which he was offered a scholarship to attend Harvard University. At college, he knew he was interested in public service, and originally considered medicine. But language and words came more easily to him than chemistry and math. Unsure of what to study, it was his college advisor who suggested there are many ways he could engage in public service, one of which is the practice of law.

Garland took his advice and graduated summa cum laude from Harvard and continued to Harvard Law School where he graduated with honors. After law school, he started his career clerking for Justice Friendly, one of the most prestigious clerkships, before pursuing a number of different legal avenues, including working for the Department of Justice, in private practice, working as a prosecutor, and eventually becoming a federal judge.

Despite Garland’s seemingly straightforward career path, much of it was serendipitous. When Garland was working in the (high-paying) private sector at Arnold and Porter―where he became a partner in four years―he took on a case representing the state of Maryland. It was the judge on that case who suggested to Garland, “You’re wasting your life, you should be a prosecutor.” Which got Garland thinking, “I felt bad, no one should be wasting their life.”

Randomly, a few days later, Garland got a call from the US Attorney who asked him to come work with him. “I figured those were two signs. And I decided that’s what I would do.”

Much of Garland’s career wasn’t premeditated, he explained at a talk he gave at Harvard Law School:

And, indeed, even when Garland was nominated to the Supreme Court in 2016, holding back tears, he said it was the greatest honor of his life, one he never expected.

While Garland may not have had an exacting career plan, he was always guided by his authentic desire to perform public service and his unwavering belief in the law.

It is hard not to be inspired by the way Judge Garland talks about the rule of law:

Again and again, in his career, Garland saw the powerful impact the law can have on the public. The Unabomber case, where he acted as a prosecutor, left a particular mark on him.

“It may be a core reason I have this deep feeling about the rule of law. On the one hand we have to make sure people don’t settle their differences violently, and on the other hand make sure that there’s a justice system that works, that's following the constitution and that resolves the issues in an appropriate way. And I think that’s what judges are supposed to do: make sure they’re faithful to the constitution, faithful to the law, and have the people’s trust that if they come before a judge they’ll get an honest hearing.”

Merrick Garland’s temperament seems to be uniquely suited for the law: composed, nonpartisan, and exceptionally fact-based. So well suited, in fact, that he never publically expressed any grievance about his nomination to the Supreme Court being blocked.

Prior to his nomination, majority leader Mitch McConnell announced he would block any nomination put forth by then President Obama, a decision he upheld―to the amazement of many―after Garland’s nomination was made public. As McConnell pointed out at the time, “From a conservative point of view, I don’t think you could have a worse nominee than Merrick Garland.”

When asked why, he stuttered, “There’s nothing...about him....that’s moderate.”

Much about Merrick Garland is moderate, deciding liberally on labor cases, and conversely more conservatively on criminal justice cases. In classifying where his views would put him on the Court, researchers would place him closest to moderate.

But that’s not even the point. The Supreme Court is supposed to be an apolitical body. A citizen wants in a judge or justice not a political agenda but a deeply rooted fair-mindedness.

The Risk Of Wavering Belief In The Supreme Court

The Supreme Court plays a much larger role on more issues than many citizens realize. Rulings, for example, on abortion, affirmative action, equal wages, and immigration have directly benefited my generation.

In America, in recent years, we have often taken our judicial system for granted. And perhaps, likewise, those operating in the judicial system have taken the public’s faith in its judiciousness for granted. Neither, we’re learning, is a given.

The invisible agreement of mutual trust is predicated on truth and transparency. The way to keep the public’s faith, as Garland has suggested in the past, is “to be as transparent with the public as you can be.” When a judge is under oath, the public needs to believe he or she is telling the truth. Any doubt starts to splinter that faith.

Merrick Garland’s judicial career―like his yearbook―is exemplary. But what makes Merrick Garland a model judge are not his credentials but his choices. His dedication to the law, to the public, to transparency, have made him unequivocally suited to the role of a judge, and maybe one day, a justice. Garland aptly quotes an unlikely hero here, Harry Potter: “It’s not your abilities [that] make you who you are, it’s your choices.”

A critical choice now lies with the Supreme Court to transcend the plague of political gridlock.

Why Judge Kavanaugh Is The Wrong Choice",
"What we tell ourselves on a daily basis has a tremendous effect on our daily lives. It’s easy to point to external factors or obstacles as the major impediments to our success; it’s a lot harder to give equal examination to the self-made mental obstacles.

Are you the hero in your story or are you the victim? Do you blame external forces or do you take responsibility for your lot in life? Do setbacks stop you in your tracks or do you see them as opportunities to try a new method?

We all have a personal story we use to define ourselves. Our upbringing and all of our experiences come together to create what psychologists call our self-schemas.

Schemas are like little personal instruction books that diagram our worldview.

When you do anything in life, you are operating according to your personal schema. Similarly, the way you react to events is due to your personal schema.

If you believe people don’t enjoy your company and you discover your coworkers went to lunch without you while you were in a meeting it will reinforce your notion of yourself.

If you believe you get along with everyone and then encounter a colleague with whom you have a contentious relationship, this will not fit into your personal schema and the adjustment will cause some discomfort.

Within our personal schemas are success schemas.

If you believe money is the answer to happiness you will likely pursue a career geared to make you rich. Whether you end up being happy because you are rich is irrelevant, the idea that it will come from your personal success schema, the force behind your actions.

Whether you’re an entrepreneur or you work for someone else, your ability to forge ahead successfully heavily relies on the belief systems going on in your head.

Sometimes these belief systems are intensified by biases, the mind’s way of playing tricks with us. Here are two biases we should all pay attention to in order to keep ourselves in check.

If I Won, I Made It Happen; If I Lost, It’s Not My Fault

It’s very easy to accept responsibility for things that go well. It’s another story to accept the blame when things go poorly.

“My company scored a huge deal because of all the work I put into it” vs “My company lost a big deal because people have it in for me.”

When we attribute our success to the efficacy of our own actions but blame our failures on external factors it’s called the self-serving bias.

Protecting our ego makes us feel good in the short-term but has deleterious effects in the long-term. You’ve probably heard the expression, “a team is only as good as its weakest link.”

When it comes to ourselves we’re both the strongest and the weakest link rolled into one. Knowing what your weakest link is allows you to work on it, improve, and eventually jump over that hurdle with enough practice.

If you never work on your weaknesses you will repeat the same mistakes over and over again, and if we repeat the same mistakes while attributing them to external factors we delay success even further.

It’s not easy to accept failures, but they are part of life. If/when they happen watch your mind to see where it goes. If you exonerate yourself completely that’s your cue to pause for a moment. Retrace your steps and see where you might have made a misstep.

Success is another opportunity to catch your mind’s potential for the self-serving bias. Chances are you weren’t the only factor that brought the success to fruition.

Broadening your awareness to all the factors that contributed to your win will keep you rooted in gratitude for the myriad of ways reality manifests; it’s an important lesson that it’s impossible to go it alone.

The good news is it’s difficult to be the sole independent factor for a win or a failure. Being mindful of this will evolve your success schema; the sooner we realize it’s impossible to go it alone, the greater the chance we have at allowing success into our lives.

There’s No More Room For Me

Why am I listing yogurt and coffee chains? To prove that even in saturated markets there is often still room for a new addition. Each of the above companies has its own flair of some kind that sets it apart from the others.

We can easily fall into the belief that if there’s something similar to our idea out there then there’s no point in pursuing it. Yet history proves otherwise. What sets your idea apart from the pack is you and the way you market it.

Of course, do your due diligence, find your angle, but don’t abandon a good idea solely because something similar exists. If anything, it tells you there’s an audience for you.

There will be room for you if you make room. As you build your business you carve out your niche. The important thing is to begin and to expand your success schema to include more possibility for your chances of winning.

Our perception of events has a tremendous effect on our well-being , so much so that it can either propel us forward or halt us in our tracks. Viewing obstacles as insurmountable will keep you rooted in your current reality whereas seeing them as valuable information can help move you to the next stage.

It always comes down to self-awareness, which means paying attention to the thoughts swirling in your head. We have to be vigilant watchdogs when guarding our mind. Any time you see your thoughts heading in a self-destructive direction that’s a cue to pause and direct it towards a healthier success schema.",
"Beyond the positive bottom-line impacts of diversity and inclusion, Celeste Warren, VP of Human Resources and Global Diversity and Inclusion at Merck, believes ""there is an awakening"" happening as it relates to how organizations should approach diversity and inclusion.

Employees don't leave what's happening inside their families and communities at the doorstep of work. Organizations and leaders have to understand and be prepared to engage workers in what once was considered too personal or touchy topics.

""We can't expect people to just turn it off when they come into the work environment,"" says Warren in my recent interview with her where she shared five tips for leading inclusively.

5 Tips to Be a Better Inclusive Leader

""[Leaders must] create an environment where they open their doors and listen,"" says Warren. ""They don't have to have all the answers because that would be highly improbable but a listening and empathetic ear can help create an environment where employees are more productive and engaged.""

Baby Boomers and Generation X tend to define diversity along the traditional lines of gender, race, and ethnicity. However, Millennials and Generation Z tend to define diversity more multi-layered ways. ""Generation Z thinks more diversely because they've been surrounded by diverse, global perspectives through social media and other technology,"" says Warren.

The emerging generations also view diversity and inclusion as fundamental to the way a company does business, more so than previous generations. In fact, 53 percent of Millennials would leave their current organization for a more inclusive one and 30 percent have left an organization for a more inclusive one.

4. Know when not to have the answer

""An inclusive leader knows when to have the answers and when to let the team figure it out,"" says Warren. ""If the answer is 'no', leaders should provide the context and encourage employees to come back [to the leader] in the future.""

Inclusive leaders must be self-aware enough to know when they don't have the answer and they have to be perceptive enough to know who on the team might have a similar working style or background that might be better equipped to address the issue.

""Create strong group dynamics and an environment where people feel energized, empowered, and engaged to speak their minds,"" says Warren. ""An inclusive leader should have the ability to unleash the creativity of their team, achieve predetermined objectives, and see the larger opportunities that exist for the team and organization.""

"In the year since allegations of sexual misconduct against Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein shocked the public, the #MeToo movement has exposed widespread workplace sexual harassment—not just in the entertainment world, but across industries. One way that companies in every sector can clamp down on harassment is through supply chain reform. In a nutshell, this means leveraging consumer, worker, and corporate power to drive change at the companies you do business with. How will the firms up and down your supply chain find out about, and prevent, harassment in their ranks? Ask them to be specific, and to sign a joint agreement with you that you’ll take specific actions to stop harassment.

In the year since allegations of sexual misconduct against Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein shocked the public, the #MeToo movement has exposed widespread workplace sexual harassment—not just in the entertainment world, but across industries.

Last week, we at New America’s Better Life Lab published what we believe is a novel, forward-thinking report on the reality that harassment is “severe, pervasive, and widespread” across low and high income jobs and male- and female-dominated occupations. We also published an accompanying toolkit, called #NowWhat?, aimed at stakeholders invested in changing this reality. Among the recommendations we offer, one in particular is salient to businesses: supply-chain reform.

In a nutshell, this means leveraging consumer, worker, and corporate power to drive change at the companies you do business with.

Consider the Fair Food Program, which leverages farmworker and consumer pressure to demand that food buyers, like fast-food companies, demand that their food suppliers take harassment and other workplace abuses seriously.

In 2011, the Coalition of Immokalee workers banded together to get consumers on board to pressure the agricultural industry to improve working conditions. Workers organized to lobby consumers to buy only from food sellers that have been certified as a “Fair Food Farms,” placing pressure on Walmart, Whole Foods, Trader Joe’s, Wendy’s, and other food sellers to “sign legally-binding agreements promising to only source tomatoes from Fair Food Farms with no outstanding wage theft, trafficking, sexual harassment, or other issues.” Certified farms then comply with auditors and participate in worker-education programs to “ensure farm workers have the right to work without violence and the opportunity to create a workplace of respect and dignity.”

How’s this approach working so far? Journalist Bernice Yeung found that “in the program’s seven years, 35 supervisors have been disciplined for sexual harassment, and 10 have been fired.” She continues: “Since 2013, two incidents of sexual harassment have been identified. The program’s most recent annual report notes that during the 2016–17 growing season, more than 70% of participating farms reported no incidents of sexual harassment.”* These findings are significant, given that our review of the research on sexual harassment in male-dominated, low-wage industries such as farm work found evidence of widespread rape. A 2010 study showed that 80% of farm working women report experiencing sexual harassment.

The way the Coalition of Immokalee Worker and Fair Food Program ensure success is by creating user-friendly, independent reporting processes for sexual harassment, conducting peer-to-peer training about sexual harassment and workplace rights in an accessible manner, taking regular climate surveys to inform the co-creation of civil workplace practices and enforcement of respectful workplace norms, and making sure employees know that they’re more important than any one harassing foreman or farmer. Notably, the Fair Food Program food addresses many other issues beyond sexual harassment, including wage theft and human trafficking, but their efforts use supply-chain reform to eliminate sexual harassment provides a novel example of how to prevent and address workplace abuse—a strategy that other industries and organizers can use.

So how can firms like yours get ahead of the curve and encourage reform across their own supply chain before they face activist pressure?

First of all, take stock of the many corporations that rely on your company’s business, either as a buyer, a retailer, or a contractor. These are companies you might have enormous influence over, even if they don’t technically operate under your management.

Second, using resources like our report, find out what kinds of factors are letting sexual harassment flourish in companies you do business with. No two industries are alike. This might be a matter of workplace hierarchies, lackluster HR policies, or longstanding cultural assumptions about who belongs in one occupation or another.

Then, it’s time to make your priorities and values about harassment and workplace culture known. This might entail drawing up a clear, written statement on what you expect from your partners and suppliers, and consequences for when they don’t hold up their end of the bargain.

Lastly, make it official. You can do this by asking your partners across your supply chain to sign onto an agreement about what is and isn’t tolerated in their workplaces, and then, and this is important, come up with a collective way to enforce that agreement. Will there be annual climate surveys and audits of how your partners are doing? And if so, are you ready to follow through on the consequences you laid out and potentially take your business elsewhere? This is where the power your firm has to influence change across your own industry and others’ really lies.

Of course, supply-chain reform is just one of a multitude of ways a single company can improve workplace culture beyond its own walls. But none of this will be effective unless a firm takes care of its own workers first. It’s one thing for McDonald’s to sign on to the Fair Food Agreement and use its power to protect farmworkers who are picking the tomatoes they buy. But as the strike against McDonald’s for its lackluster response to sexual harassment in September showed, it still has work to do in protecting its own workers from workplace abuse.

With the right research, dedicated partners, and a plan of action, a company can change not only its own workplace culture—but also all those linked to it.

*Editor’s note: After this article was published, a program spokesperson clarified that the two cited incidents of sexual harassment since 2013 involved sexual harassment with physical contact by supervisors. Other incidents of verbal harassment, by both supervisors and co-workers, have also been reported and dealt with through the Program’s corrective action process.",None
"I speak to a lot of business owners and managers every year about the challenges they face. Back during the recession the biggest challenge was managing overhead and cash flow. Today the challenges are completely different. In fact, the overwhelming issue I hear is about people: how to find them and particularly how to keep the good ones.

It’s tough when you lose a good employee. Many blame the low unemployment environment, bigger companies or competitors offering better benefits or the changing priorities of the millennial generation. But maybe - just maybe - we're partly to blame to too. Maybe the people leaving us are doing so because of...well...us.

A recent survey from jobsite Monster.com seems to make that argument. After polling 957 people last month who were openly seeking new jobs, the company asked why they wanted to leave their current employer. 76 percent of them blamed a ""toxic"" boss for being the reason.

What exactly does ""toxic"" mean? To me, it means being the kind of person who poisons the workspace with bad or inappropriate behavior. In short, being a jerk. But let's agree that people can give this word a very wide definition. A ""toxic"" boss can also be that person who insists that employees come to work on time or be demanding or be gruff or never come to a happy hour or just barks out orders. It all depends on who you ask - and there are always two sides to every story.

For example, it seems that ""toxic"" also means being selfish. 26 percent of the employees in the Monster survey said their boss was ""power-hungry"" or only looking out for themselves. 18 percent said their boss is a ""micromanager,"" and 17 percent said their boss is ""incompetent."" Fifteen percent said their boss is never around.

Is this fair? Does being ""power-hungry"" mean making independent decisions or moving things in a direction that an employee doesn't like? Does being a ""micromanager"" mean having to spend more time checking on that employee's less than average work? Does being ""incompetent"" translate into making business decisions where an employee disagrees? And just because you're ""never around"" does that mean you're not doing your job? Wait...I thought you were too much of a ""micromanager."" How can you be both?

People like to come up with reasons why things don’t work out and oftentimes it’s the boss that’s blamed. Of course, there could be truth to the story. But there's only one important thing to know: you and that employee didn't get along. So he or she can come up with any reason they like but the most important thing is that they're leaving and that’s going to cost you in the short term.

If this is a one-off situation, then you can shrug off the loss. But if there's a pattern of losing employees then maybe, just maybe, you are a little toxic - or at least a pain the you-know-what. So here's what to do: don't change.

That’s right. Don’t change. You may not be the best manager in the world. Your people skills may not be so hot. But if you're successfully running a business it's likely you've got other skills that compensate, be they technical, financial or otherwise. Of course that doesn't relieve you of the responsibility of being a good boss. It's just that you do other things better. So - if you can - do what other smart executives in this situation do and get someone better than you to do the managing. You suck at it.

Managing is a skill. It takes someone with patience and the right temperament. Sure, some of the greatest CEOs are great with people. But then again there’s Steve Jobs. There are people in this world who are just better managers than others. If you're not one of them, and you've got the resources to bring someone in to be that manager, then do it. Your people are your best asset. Whether you're truly ""toxic"" or not, you're not doing what's right for your company if you insist on poorly managing them.",
"I've heard different leaders talk about this idea--that you are the average of the 10 people you surround yourself with. I define great business leaders as people who are constantly trying to improve themselves. So, as a business leader myself, one who is always open to improving, this idea has really stuck with me.

When you look at who you currently surround yourself with to determine whether they reflect the type of person you're trying to be, it's important to ask very specific questions. To become a curator of the best people to have around you, consider:

1. What motivates them? Do they know what motivates you?

If you and another person have somewhat aligned motivations or at least understand each other's motivations, you can truly help each other out when an opportunity presents itself in either of your lives. Motivation is also something that needs consistent fuel to stay lit, so having people around you who understand that and feed it can keep your energy and productivity at a high level.

2. How do they measure their own success?

We all have different views of success. Is it just making money? For me, it's about being a good dad, husband, boss...and let's be honest: making some money. If the people around you measure success similarly, then they will challenge you in ways that increase your success in what matters to you. I want people around me who will encourage me to be a good dad and call me out when I could be better. It's easy to gravitate toward viewing success as others perceive it, so it's important to deliberately spend time with others who measure success the same way you do.

3. Do you get a sense of loyalty from them?

Now, I want to be clear that blind loyalty--where someone just agrees with you all the time or always has your back, even when you are really wrong--is not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about loyalty in the sense that people are there for you when you need them. You know that they will look out for your best interests; you can always have a down-to-earth, truthful conversation; and they won't flip on you for personal gain. As simple as this sounds, it's sometimes hard to find people you can trust like this--there's a lot of self-interest out there. So when you find people with the potential for this kind of loyalty, latch onto them.

4. Will they make you better?

Do the people around you have skills you don't have that could be valuable? There's also a big difference between a helpful person who looks to challenge you and a yes man (or woman). Also, cultivate people who look out for ways that you can learn. For example, one of my close entrepreneur friends had a tax situation come up with his company, so he sent me a few articles and a brief explanation of things I should look out for. I really appreciated that he would take the time to try to help me learn about something that wasn't on my radar at all.

5. Are they capable of giving and receiving transparent feedback?

Transparent feedback is very hard to give, but it's vital to making someone better and having a healthy relationship. Self-awareness is a gift, but it is extremely hard to have it unless you also have people around you willing to give you transparent feedback to help you. There are a lot of times when I've felt like something I said or did was perfectly normal, but a friend or co-worker did me the favor of saying ""I think that was taken the wrong way."" It's good to improve your own self-awareness, but sometimes it takes others to help you out with that.

Take some time to write down the 10 people you spend most of your time with. Do they meet at least some of these criteria? You may also want to think of your own list of criteria and whether the people closest to you fit them. If not, it might make sense to re-evaluate the people you are surrounding yourself with.",
"The grass is always greener on the other side, especially on the job front. You may be talking with a friend who has really cool perks that you don’t have. Perhaps she gets more time off or has a more flexible work schedule than you. Whatever it is you crave, it seems like she has it at her job and you don’t. Even though we all rationally know that no job is perfect, you hear this and suddenly you feel like you should update your resume and find that perfect job everyone else has and you don’t.

Hold the phone. Before you jump ship, contemplate the following.

Why do you want to leave?

Are you tired of the project your currently working on? Are you having a conflict with a colleague. Or, have you learned everything you can in your current role and have found the next great step in your career? As a mentor of mine wisely asks, “Are you running away from something or toward something?” It’s easy to get frustrated or burnt out and to be tempted to run away in search of that proverbial greener grass. Rash decisions about changing jobs can often lead to regret. In your career, you always want to be moving forward toward that next opportunity where you can learn something new or advance your skill set in a way that your current role can’t. Hang on. It’s worth the wait.

Have you talked to your manager about your challenges?

By this I mean, have you very clearly talked to your manager, helping her understand exactly how you feel about your situation? I learned the hard way how important clear and consistent communication is when it comes to obstacles.

Many years ago, I worked for an agency that I loved. I had a great relationship with the owner and things were going well, until one day I had a significant personality clash with a key executive at the company. I tried to work it out but couldn’t do it on my own. It seemed impossible to overcome. The agency owner knew about it and I didn’t feel like he took it seriously. I believed my only way out of the situation was to leave the agency. So I found another job. When I resigned, the owner was shocked. He knew that I was having trouble with this person but he didn’t know how dire the situation was for me. Should he have listened better when I told him? Perhaps. But I believe most of the accountability was on me. I didn’t make it clear how serious the situation was for me. He didn’t know that I couldn’t find a way past it. He didn’t know that not resolving this was a deal breaker for me. How could he? I never told him.

Now that I’m in a leadership role, I know there is a difference between when an employee is venting and when a situation points that employee toward the door. But I don’t always know where someone is in their journey across that spectrum. So I need to be told. If I have a team member who is in a situation where she feels the need to leave, I’d like the chance to know about it and resolve that for her. In order to do that I need to be crystal clear on what the issue is and the severity of it.

As an employee, I’ve put that into practice myself. A few years back, I hit a wall in resolving a challenge I was having. I didn’t see a way out. It was impacting my sleep, my work and my life in a negative way that wasn’t sustainable. Learning from my past situation, I set up time to talk to my leaders about it. I showed up prepared with a clear articulation of the problem and I asked for help. I let them know that I couldn’t resolve it on my own and that the circumstances were unsustainable for me. I was shocked by the amount of support I received from them. They recognized the severity of the issue for me and that it wasn’t easy (or typical) for me to ask for help. They took swift action and the matter was resolved. It was a very difficult conversation to have, but I’m so grateful I took the step.

What are your goals?

When I talk about goals, I’m not just talking about your career goals. As a person who subscribes to the idea of work/life integration rather than work/life balance, I have to take the entire picture into consideration. Like anyone, the kind of work I’m doing matters, along with opportunities to try new things, recognition and support from my leadership. Beyond that, for me, the people with whom I’m surrounded, the amount of travel, autonomy, flexibility and values are huge. That entire 360 view of what makes up my life is factored into any career decision I make. If you haven’t already, take some time to identify and prioritize what’s important to you. Don’t be shy about it or afraid to speak up. As your life changes, your goals will likely evolve as well. Share these with your manager. It’s impossible for her to help you achieve your goals if you aren’t both clear on what they are.

As a Gen Xer, it’s so interesting to see how things have changed from my parents’ generation to the next generation. My parents looked at a job as a lifelong commitment, not nearly as transitional as they can be today. I challenge myself to find the right balance of the two where I’m thoughtfully taking on new opportunities (internal or external) as they make sense for my career and my life, not just based on where the grass seems greenest.",coaching
"We’re all familiar with the top-down management style, where senior leaders take charge and employees are expected to follow. In fact, it’s the organizational style that Gen Xers and baby boomers are used to and expect to use in our own companies. But now, millennials are the largest generation in America’s labor force. So there’s an impending need to switch to an organizational style that caters to this generation.

In fact, only 29% of employed millennials in the U.S. are engaged workers, according to a Gallup report. These numbers are terrifying because you need an engaged workforce for your company to succeed.

Most of the people on my team are millennials, and I’ve realized that a bottom-up organizational style works best for us. This isn’t surprising because this style of management engages every team member since they know that they have a voice. They’re more involved in the organization and feel empowered to perform exceptionally well.

While your employees may be responsible for cultivating a bottom-up work culture, you need to start by empowering the culture in the first place. Here are some of the tactics that have helped me empower a bottom-up culture in my company:

Encourage Dissent (And Learn How To Handle It)

In a bottom-up organizational style, dissent should be the responsibility of every employee, but you need to encourage it first. Your employees might have experienced certain challenges in their work because of how the organization is functioning. Perhaps certain steps are holding them back from reaching their full potential.

They should be able to freely share their ideas, insights and opinions on these challenges. Perhaps they might even have suggestions on how certain tasks should be handled or how certain processes can be improved upon. By listening to these insights, your company will be able to develop ideas for improvement in current processes.

However, most employees may have a hard time voicing their opinions in fear of negative repercussions. They may be afraid of getting blasted by you or someone in a managerial position for even daring to have an opinion, if that’s what they’re used to.

So, you need to encourage them to share their thoughts on their respective responsibilities without the fear of any negative repercussions. If they’re not freely communicating with you, perhaps you might need to reach out initially and have a one-on-one meeting.

And if they voice any dissent here, listen and acknowledge. Many managers and leaders make the mistake of getting defensive when this happens. Avoid doing this, as employees may no longer feel comfortable sharing their thoughts with you in the future, which would mean you wouldn’t be able to empower a bottom-up culture.

Some of the processes you have in place may not be ideal for a bottom-up organizational style. For instance, some procedures may require that an employee gets managerial authorization for even the simplest of actions. This could seriously affect productivity and employee morale, as the employee may feel like they don’t have a voice.

You need to go over your current processes to see what can be improved upon, based on employee feedback and business goals. See where you can make changes so that employees have more autonomy to make their own decisions. Clearly lay out in writing what steps they need to follow and at which point they should consult a supervisor or manager.

Once you’ve laid out a new process, have a clear explanation for why this revised procedure needs to be implemented. This will help employees understand that there is a valid reason why this new process is necessary. And if they understand the reason for the change, they’ll be able to understand when to resort to a different method to accomplish certain tasks.

You should also ensure that the changes you make are in alignment with the goals of your employees. This will give them more enthusiasm to get involved and implement the changes.

For instance, let’s say your new process includes an employee advocacy program, and you encourage employees to share your brand content on social media. You could focus on making this process easier, more engaging and more rewarding.

Perhaps you could set up a reward system to recognize and reward employees who are exceptional advocates. You could also use platforms like Smarp or SocioAdvocacy to make it easier for your employees to discover relevant content that they can share with their personal networks. This way, they can easily participate in your advocacy program without sacrificing their productivity.

Empower Influential Employees To Set An Example

Although you may have great ideas on how to change your organizational culture, bringing about that change is a huge challenge. Your employees have been following certain practices for years and they’ve become used to functioning a certain way. So, you can’t just send out an email about the change and expect them to implement it.

As mentioned earlier, clearly explain why the change is necessary and keep every employee in the loop. This will make them more inclined to implement those changes. But in addition to this, you can encourage more influential employees to support the change. If they set an example, more people may follow suit.

Every company has certain employees who have a great deal of influence over their colleagues. Maybe because they’re exceptionally good at what they do or they’ve been with the company for years, people hold them in high regard. These are the employees whose influence you need to leverage to successfully implement any organizational changes.

These are some of the essential steps that have helped me empower my team to embrace a bottom-up culture. You could start from here and discover more ideas along the way that will work specifically for your company. The goal should be to encourage employee participation and engagement, which can result in better organizational performance.",
"“It’s me! I know it! What’s wrong with me? Why can’t I make this work?”

Something is off, and you can’t put your finger on it.

If you’ve thought this as a leader before, the honest truth is simply that you may not be a fit at your company, and this is OK. Absolutely nothing is wrong with you; you and your company may just be going in different directions. As a leader in your company, this can be an unsettling realization, but imagine what can happen if you stop fighting to make it work and start accepting that growing together is not your future.

Having heard “why can’t this work?” countless times from my clients who are struggling in their current leadership role, there are some questions you should ask yourself to determine if it is a wrong fit.

• What am I trying to achieve in this role?

• What exactly am I fighting for?

• What am I willing to let go of?

• Does this align with where the rest of the organization wants to go?

• If interviewing with this company today, would I want to work here?

By identifying these, you start to bring clarity to why you’re feeling the way you do. Then, you can start moving forward.

Other things that often indicate it could be a fit issue, not a skill or talent issue:

• It’s always a hard fight to bring initiatives forward and have effective meetings.

• You’re not able to use your strengths in your role any longer.

• There’s been a gradual shift in the company over time.

• You’re not being challenged to grow, but “encouraged” to fit.

• You are never (or almost never) excited about wins or successes.

• You don’t feel like you’re contributing or being effective.

• Your confidence and self-esteem are at an all-time low.

If you’re nodding your head in agreement here, awesome! You’re already seeing that it’s not you. Next, it’s about how to move forward when you recognize this disconnect.

What To Do When It’s A Fit Issue

If you’ve identified that it is a fit issue, you have options. You can:

• Suck it up, buy into where the rest of the company is going and stay (Note: I’ve never seen this work well).

• Stay in the fight with the company and hope this will change (It rarely does).

• Leave. You need to move on and stop trying to make it work. Chances are, you and the company have outgrown each other or were never really compatible. Accepting this, you can now grow.

It is absolutely OK to leave, especially if it’s a fit issue. If you realize that what you’re trying to achieve in your role simply isn’t going to happen, determine what realistically is the best outcome you’re trying to achieve.

If you find yourself having to convince your leaders/the organization’s mindset, you’re in a no-win situation. It's a bit harsh, but the illusion you need to let go of is that the company needs you. They don’t need you to save them. Rather, there is another organization out there that needs exactly what you offer and where you want to go.

Time and again, in my experience, when a client comes to terms with a fit issue and they leave, they nearly always find a better fit shortly thereafter. Knowing how exactly to leave and keep your confidence intact is a key part to moving forward.

• Accept. It’s not you, and it’s not them. This can improve how you approach coming to work in the time being as it removes the pressure of trying to be someone different. Knowing you’re going to leave can remove the fight as you transition away.

• Identify. Where do you want to go next? Start networking and taking on a work search. Reach out to headhunters and your personal network, conduct informational interviews with trusted colleagues, mentors and friends to help you get clear on what’s next, what values are important to you in an organization and what your “must haves” are in your next role in order to bring your strengths forward.

• Ask. Have the hard conversation with your company and ask for a package. This doesn’t work all the time, but organizations can partner with you to help you make your way forward. Keep this as positive as possible, such as saying: “I’ve thought about my role here and realized that we’re just not a fit. I hope we can come to an agreement to find a person who is the right fit.” Then carry the conversation from there.

Recognizing that you and your company are going in different directions doesn’t mean that there’s something wrong with you or your leadership skills. You create great value -- after all, why would you have been hired/promoted as a leader in the first place? You may just have a different future than what you thought. Remember that your strengths will be a competitive advantage when you're in the right company for you.

Ask yourself what’s harder, continuing the fight or finding fulfillment elsewhere?",
"Think of the genesis stories of the careers of some public figures you know.

After struggling with her sexuality for years, Ellen DeGeneres came out on national TV in what is considered a watershed moment in LGBT history. She later received the Presidential Medal of Freedom — America's highest civilian honor — for her advocacy. Mel Robbins was at rock bottom when she had to motivate herself to get out of bed using what she's now copyrighted as ""the 5 second rule."" Kylie Jenner started a nearly billion dollar cosmetic empire — and became a cultural phenomenon — because, initially, she was insecure about her lips looked. Tony Robbins was abused as a child, and ultimately became one of the most well-known entrepreneurs and motivational speakers in the world.

""If my mom had been the mother I thought I wanted, I wouldn't be as driven; I wouldn't be as hungry,"" Robins once told CNBC. ""I wouldn't have suffered, so I probably wouldn't have cared about other people's suffering as much as I do. And it made me obsessed with wanting to understand people and help create change.""

These stories, while belonging to spectacularly successful individuals, are not really anomalies. Ask anyone in your life to identify the catalyst of their deepest and most profound personal and professional change. In almost every case, you'll discover that most people had to come upon a challenge that seemed insurmountable before they activated their latent potential and got to work building the life of their dreams.

As Aurelius would say: The impediment to action advances action — what stands in the way becomes the way.

The point is that most people think following their dreams and achieving their goals is a matter of having a crystal clear idea of what they want and then just strategizing how to get it.

This is why so many people are lost.

Your life's purpose is not revealed through desire, it's revealed through discomfort.

Your most prolonged discomfort is a signal to what you're here to master, which is why your discomfort will not leave you alone until you are living the way you want to be. Eventually, you will come to see this as the greatest gift of your life. Discomfort is the subconscious way you communicate to yourself that something could be better, stronger, and different. Your discomfort is not a punishment, it is not purgatory, it is not failure. It is only you pushing yourself because you know you're meant to have and be more than you are right now.

In his theory on why seeking discomfort is essential to a well-lived life, Stephen Guise explains it like this:

Discomfort is most useful when the situation can be repeated, because subsequent repetitions will be more and more comfortable. Exercise is a great example, as you can exercise multiple times a week, and the more you do it, the better you’ll get at it. If you have an opportunity to scald your skin, I recommend that you pass. You might learn a valuable lesson from it and even become tougher through the experience, but since it’s not something you’d ever want to repeat (ouch!), the overall growth potential is weak. That said, one-time ventures into discomfort can be helpful. Some say that a single skydiving session changed their perspective. But real progress probably came afterwards, with what they did with their perspective. For example, maybe they used skydiving as a symbolic springboard to face their fears. Exposing yourself to your fears (in a safe environment) is a valuable, growth-inducing form of discomfort.

Though many are placed in positions of suffering unintentionally, others recognize the benefit in ""practicing discomfort,"" and come to see it as a means of slowly stretching their comfort zones, and therefore, their ability to tolerate challenging situations.

Sujan Patel explained it like this: ""Putting yourself in new and unfamiliar situations triggers a unique part of the brain that releases dopamine, nature’s make-you-happy chemical. Here’s the mind-blower; that unique region of the brain is only activated when you see or experience completely new things.""

Be that as it is, there's also something to be said for intentionally crafting your ""comfort zone"" around behaviors and thoughts that actively contribute to your wellbeing. If neurons that fire together wire together, then what we build much of our lives around that which we repeatedly do. It's a game of becoming comfortable with that which will move your life forward, as opposed to that which is holding it back. It's learning to see discomfort not as the enemy, but as a crucial tool.",
"Few things can be more invigorating or exciting than starting a successful side hustle—but at the same time, there’s no denying that these entrepreneurial endeavors require a lot of time, energy and effort.

Getting the results you want is far from guaranteed. Rejection is commonplace when trying to land new clients or snag a key investor. Even when you are achieving your desired outcomes, the sheer amount of energy that goes into making your side hustle a success can contribute to both physical and mental fatigue.

The end result? Burnout. Stress, frustration and other negative emotions that can cause you to provide subpar work, or even decide to ditch your side hustle altogether.

It’s a serious problem, and one that has caused many aspiring entrepreneurs to flounder in their pursuits.

To learn more about how to address this pervasive issue, I recently sat down to chat with both Susie Moore, the Amazon bestselling author of What If It Does Work Out? How a Side Hustle Can Change Your Life and Jaimie Crooks, the licensed, Harvard-educated coach and CEO of Definitely Definitely.

Here’s what you need to know about dealing with side hustle burnout.

“Your life is supposed to be fun, and doing something on your terms, like a side hustle, is meant to be enjoyable,” says Moore.

This basic premise plays a key role in helping many would-be entrepreneurs settle on an idea for a side hustle in the first place. They choose something they’re interested in—something that makes them curious.

It’s when you start to lose that genuine interest that burnout rears its ugly head.

“When you really enjoy what you’re doing, then your setbacks just don’t hurt you as much and your resilience is naturally going to be stronger because what you’re doing means something to you,” Moore notes.

On the other hand, if you reach a point where you feel like you’re only doing it for the money, you’re far more likely to get burned out.

Indeed, getting into a side hustle for the wrong reasons puts you at much greater risk for burnout from the get-go. A study by the Harvard Business Review found that “obsessively passionate” entrepreneurs—those most interested in money or social acceptance—were far more likely to report “feeling that work was more emotionally draining and that working all day required a great deal of effort. They indicated feeling frustrated by their work and even that it was breaking them down.”

Though as a whole, entrepreneurs aren’t much more likely to report feeling stressed than an everyday employee, studies have found that they are far more likely to experience depression, ADHD and other mental health issues as a result of burnout.

""The problem for side hustlers is that many of them try to ignore these symptoms. Instead of taking a step back and recognizing that something is wrong, they push themselves to work that much harder to land the next client or finish a big project. All that pressure and stress has a cumulative effect that can do much deeper damage than simply causing you to feel disinterested in your work.""

According to Dr. Sherrie Bourg Carter, the chronic stress that leads to burnout generally results in three primary outcomes: “physical and emotional exhaustion, cynicism and detachment [and] feelings of ineffectiveness and lack of accomplishment.”

What makes it even more tricky, is that many of these symptoms occur gradually over time.

For example, those in the early stages of burnout may just feel a little more tired or have trouble focusing. They might feel tense, irritable and negative, especially in regards to their work.

Without proper self-care though, these issues worsen.

Continued anxiety can weaken the immune system and contribute to frequent bouts of insomnia. Some people experience a loss of appetite or become more prone to angry outbursts. The sense of detachment and loss of enjoyment can spread from your side hustle to activities with family and friends. Apathy can even lead to full-on depression.

If you’ve noticed some seemingly minor symptoms of burnout, it's essential that you take action before your relationships and work performance begin to suffer.

So what can you do?

First, you need to learn how to manage your schedule and not try to stretch yourself too thin by filling every available hour with work. “A side hustle doesn’t have to take over your life… you can choose your own schedule,” Moore says.

“If you’re really intentional and clear about what time you have, then time just seems to expand. It’s when you’re putting things off and leaving everything to the last minute, that you tend to work crazy late or feel overwhelmed.”

If you’re having trouble controlling your schedule, evaluate whether a particular activity (like taking the time to plan out your full scope of work in advance of starting a project) helps you accelerate faster toward your side hustle goals. If an action doesn’t have that desired outcome, you can probably safely eliminate it from your calendar to avoid overworking yourself.

“Entrepreneurs need to be mindful of the things that trigger stress in their lives,” adds Crooks.

“Chronic stress is what ultimately causes burnout, even if the triggers vary from person to person. Try writing down moments when you feel stressed so you can figure out which tasks or events are contributing to your burnout. This way, it becomes easier to work out what you need to change about your routine and habits to avoid the things that cause the most intense stress.”

Finally, carve out regular time in your week to practice a little self-care.

Take care of yourself physically by exercising, meditating or practicing yoga—activities that can eliminate stress hormones and give you a renewed sense of energy.

"Often, corporate leaders find themselves in one of two positions: either they are consistently missing targets, stuck in a cycle of teams failing to deliver on the actions necessary to achieve desired results; or they are just meeting their numbers, but ultimately left wondering why employees are unable or unwilling to go above and beyond to exceed expectations.

Even when corporate leaders have excellent management skills and make the best hires in their fields, they often still struggle to hold others accountable for achieving shared organizational results. To compound the issue, employees across the globe are reporting historically low levels of engagement at work, rendering accountability an uphill battle for leaders everywhere.

How a Lack of Clarity Hinders Accountability in the Workplace

The most likely culprit for an accountability deficit in the workplace is simply a lack of clarity around the concept. Most employers don't think it necessary to define accountability -- they presume everyone already knows what it means.

Unfortunately, when leaders fail to create a common language for understanding accountability, employees all come to the table with their own notions: some may believe that accountability is the same thing as responsibility, while others believe that it requires taking the blame when teams fail to deliver as promised. Misalignment around what is meant by accountability causes misunderstanding and ineffective performance. As a result, your employees may end up pointing fingers and playing the blame game when something goes amiss.

Take this example: a supervisor asks an employee for a report by Friday. The employee works hard to complete the report and delivers it on time. When the supervisor reads the report, however, he or she becomes annoyed that it does not cover the proper scope, makes grammatical errors, or fails to include important metrics -- so the supervisor feels the employee is not being accountable. In the meantime, the employee feels confident that he or she has successfully taken accountability because the report was delivered on the specified topic at the specified time. Here, a lack of clarity around what accountability entails creates a kink in the pipeline, inhibiting results.

Even if employees do share a unified definition of accountability in the workplace, many leaders still fail to define their organization's critical Key Results. As a result, employees come to work without a sense of direction or an understanding of how their daily tasks impact larger-scale results. This lack of direction causes confusion when priorities in the workplace seem to shift. If there is no clear target toward which employees are moving as a team, there can be no sense of accountability for reaching that target.

The Secret to Higher Accountability at Work

The first crucial step toward holding others accountable at work is to address this lack of clarity. Begin by aligning your team around a shared definition of positive accountability as the personal choice to rise above one's circumstances and demonstrate the ownership necessary for achieving results. Disseminate this message throughout your organization, ensuring that employees in every department recognize that accountability demands proactive commitment to the organization's shared goals. In organizations with high accountability, employees do not simply meet expectations, but consistently ask themselves, What else can I do?

Once accountability is embraced by employees at every level of your company, identify the meaningful, measurable topline results that your organization must achieve each year. Research indicates that people struggle to remember more than seven items on any given list, so narrowing your goals down to just three to five crucial results gives all employees a clear, memorable, and meaningful target to which they can connect their daily work.

After you've achieved clarity around accountability and your organization's Key Results, it's time to operationalize by actively implementing these principles. Done effectively, this means that each employee aligns his or her daily actions around topline results, acting with the knowledge that he or she is a key player in achieving those results.

Consider the earlier scenario, reimagined: a supervisor asks an employee for a report by Friday. Keeping in mind that one of the organization's clearly defined topline results is 10% year-over-year revenue increase, the supervisor outlines their expectations that the report include specific revenue growth metrics. The employee asks a follow-up question to clarify these expectations and agrees to take accountability to include all necessary information in the report.

Feeling as though they can do more, however -- and remembering the desired result of 10% year-over-year revenue increase -- the employee takes the initiative to include relevant expenditures as well as growth metrics, and ensures the report is proofread before submission. The employee submits the thorough, results-focused report well before the deadline, and the supervisor is pleased. Both parties have held themselves accountable for achieving the desired outcome.",
"""People often underestimate the importance of how different our views, perspectives, culture, and our experiences are, but they also underestimate the importance of leveraging those differences and cultural perspectives when driving a business,"" says Celeste Warren, VP of Human Resources and Global Diversity and Inclusion at Merck, during my recent interview with her.

""Don't just tolerate [diversity] but understand it and allow it to drive performance of the organization,"" says Warren.

An often underestimated and overlooked way that diversity and inclusion can drive performance, is by supporting different ways of working.

""The future of work is about taking risks and sponsoring different ways of working,"" says Warren. ""Entertain different ways in which people are productive....this seems to be especially true across generations.""

Warren provides the example, ""a Generation Xer might not need a lot of feedback and can be more independent in their work, while a Millennial might desire more feedback and have a different style of working.""

The goal is to create diverse and inclusive work environments that enable teams to execute with the confidence of a Baby Boomer, the experience of Generation X, the velocity of Millennials, and with the fresh perspective of Generation Z.

In order to effectively lead in today's fast-paced, highly diverse, and multi-generational workplace, leaders must understand and appreciate each generation's varying preferences of work environments and work styles.

""Leaders must be more tolerant and understanding across generations...[because] the different vehicles of HR--retaining, attracting and developing employees--are different across generations,"" says Warren. ""Don't expect others to work the same way as you work.""

Warren encourages inclusive leaders to ask themselves, ""How can I meet people where they are so they can really be productive towards the mission of the organization.""

The needs of individuals--single parent, caring for elderly parents, disabled, etc.--have to be considered when objectives are set,"" says Warren. ""We tell managers [at Merck] to set the objective and the timeline and then make the HOW individualized to the need of the individual.""

How are the objectives assigned? How is feedback delivered? How is the individual allowed to work to achieve the objectives? How is the individual supported?

""Diversity and inclusion is about understanding the team as individuals and meeting them where they are,"" says Warren. ""The support managers give is unique.""

Take learning and development for example, in the past traditional training required sitting in a classroom or being alongside a person on the job. ""Meet the next generation where they are...How are [leaders] creating an environment that enables Millennials and future generations to be productive and not get stuck in the traditional ways of working,"" says Warren.

Learning and development is one of many workplace dynamics that needs to be more inclusive. Training of the past is outdated. It needs to be integrated with how people learn and work, especially considering how different the emerging generations learn. (Read this to learn how to train the next generation at work.)",
"Automation is on the rise and its prevalence will shift the workplace. Rather than taking jobs away, The McKinsey Global Institute reports in its research document ""Jobs Lost, Jobs Gained"", that it will create almost as many jobs as it removes.

In fact, they predict that ""for nearly all occupations, automation will change the mix of activities that humans perform."" They go on further to say, ""with automation, such shifts may become more pronounced, although the specifics will vary by country. In Germany, workers of the future will likely spend more time on activities that require applying expertise interacting with and managing people and less time on predictable physical activities like collecting data and processing data where machines already exceed human performance."" What this means is that we, as a society, will need to improve our emotional intelligence and learn the behavior habits that allow for us to be our best selves at work.

McKinsey's report is just the tip of the iceberg. Stanford University's Graduate School of Business recently published the ""Psychology of Kindness in the Workplace"" which explains that a culture of caring and compassion is necessary for work. If work is changing, how do you prepare yourself? How do you start to improve your own self-awareness, which is a precursor for being kinder and more collaborative with others? Here are 3 actions you can start today so that you will be ahead of the curve.

While self-awareness seems easy, it actually requires work. It requires hiring a therapist or a coach to help you see yourself more realistically. It's also being vulnerable with others and asking for feedback and being curious - not defensive about what they have to say. You live with yourself every day, but you're never on the receiving end of your behavior. Building self-aware allows you to see yourself, and how you treat others more clearly.

Competition breeds comparison, and comparing yourself to others will only lead you further away from yourself. Usually, you start comparing yourself when you don't feel confident about your own value. One way that you can start owning your value is to uncover your own Genius. Your Genius is the thinking or problem solving that you're best at. It's your super-power. Start paying attention to the problems you enjoy solving and gets you in the zone. Own that Genius and value it. Once you start to value yourself more, you will naturally stop comparing yourself to others. When you are comparing, that is a sign that something isn't right within yourself and your own situation. Look within versus looking outside.

Curiosity allows your mind to be open. When it comes to having a high EQ and working well with others, you must be curious. The opposite of curious is close-minded or being judgmental. These negative states will prevent you from being able to work well with others and to find common ground with anyone. Curiosity is one of the most important traits to build for the future of work. Also, when your curious, you learn, which is absolutely essential for any kind of true success.",
"The first to study female leadership 30 years ago, Sally Helgesen wrote a ground-breaking book titled The Female Advantage: Women’s Ways of Leadership. As she studied a number of America’s most successful female leaders by following them around and closely watching them, five observations stood out.

• have a bias for direct communication rather than following the chain of command,

• put themselves at the center of the people they lead,

• are comfortable with diversity, and

• are skilled at integrating their personal lives and their lives at work rather than compartmentalizing.

Back in 1990, when The Female Advantage was first published, Helgesen’s findings were not viewed as well-established attributes of successful leaders. Today, in the fast-paced, interconnected world we live in, each of her five observations are now viewed as ideal leadership traits of the best leaders, male or female.

Fast forward to 2012. Jack Zenger and Joseph Folkman wrote in Harvard Business Review that year about their research of more than 7,000 360-degree performance reviews that found women leaders outranked male leaders in nearly every one of 16 leadership competencies, including taking initiative and driving for results, competencies that are stereotypical male strengths.

In 2015, Gallup research found that female managers are better at engaging employees (both male and female) than male managers. Look deeper into the Gallup research and you’ll find that female leaders were rated higher in areas that required connecting with the people they led, such as giving recognition, providing helpful performance feedback, and getting people in the right role so they would learn and grow.

Another way to think of these findings is that many men are focused on achieving task excellence and results but many women have a broader focus on task excellence and relationship excellence, and that combination is producing higher employee engagement and better results.

As a guy who grew up mostly around guys and became a father of all daughters, I can tell you anecdotally that women are in fact stronger at developing relationship excellence. As a former Wall Street executive who left the Street to become an author, speaker and consultant on leadership and organizational culture, I can also tell you that in a knowledge economy, relationship excellence is especially critical to employee engagement, productivity and innovation.

Now I have a confession to make: Although I’m a recognized expert on connection and connection culture, my wife, Katie, is the more natural connector of the two of us. I’ve learned so much from her watching her in action that I’ve asked her to mentor me to become a stronger connector (which she’s doing).

Guys, I encourage you to find someone in your life who can mentor you to become a better connector. It may be a significant woman in your life.

And to women, I would say be confident in your desire to connect with people at work and pursue relationship excellence.

The best-performing organizations foster a sense of connection and have leaders who care about people. Most women, it seems, have known this was the key all along.",communication
"One of the hardest things about introducing innovation or change in organizations is getting people on board. This is especially true in health care. Health care providers are being asked to spend more time on documentation, see more patients in a day, and use unfamiliar processes and tools. For many, this means less time healing patients and fostering wellness – the reasons providers became health care professionals. But when innovations and changes are seen as clashing with longstanding patient care values, staff are less likely to adopt new behaviors and practices. Health care leaders need to focus on aligning innovation with existing cultural values, and devote more time to explaining how new processes and behaviors will allow employees to better enact their values and deliver high quality care. Three steps may help: 1) Seek to understand why staff think innovations or changes do not align with the existing culture and mission; 2) Engage employees with data to explain the problem, its urgency, and how to address it; 3) Pay attention to the behaviors you reward and tolerate.

One of the hardest things about introducing innovation or change in organizations is getting people on board. This is especially true in health care.

As health care organizations are being pressured to cut costs, reduce medical errors, and adopt both standardized processes and new innovations, providers are being asked to give up established and comfortable ways of working. They are having to spend more time on documentation, see more patients in a day, and use unfamiliar processes and tools. For many staff, physicians, and nurses, these changes mean less time healing patients and fostering wellness — the reasons they became health care professionals. Naturally, many start to question the direction of their organization, as these new behaviors and practices appear to conflict with the values of their profession.

When staff view innovations and changes as clashing with longstanding patient care values, they are less likely to adopt new behaviors and practices. This is why health care leaders need to focus on aligning innovation with existing cultural values, and devote more time to explaining how new processes and behaviors will allow employees to better enact their values and deliver high quality care.

Based on our research on organization change, our involvement in health care leadership training, and our conversations with over a hundred health care executives, we offer three key ways managers can engage providers in change and connect innovation efforts to their core motivations, passions, and values.

Seek to understand why staff think innovations or changes do not align with the existing culture and mission.  In a leadership training session we observed, the CEO of a nonprofit medical practice and research organization listened to division and department chairs share their employees’ concerns: quality care is sacrificed for financial pressures, standardized processes negate years of expertise, techniques once heralded as best practices are being replaced, and so on.

The CEO told these leaders to take two steps: first, listen to the doctors and staff to understand why they perceive misalignment between the myriad of changes and the values of the organization; second, reframe and strengthen the connection between innovations and the core values of the hospital, so it no longer seems like a misalignment. For example, standardized processes or instruments are not negating doctors’ expertise, but rather helping ensure consistent quality of care.

Elsewhere, a CEO of a large integrated health system told us about seeking to understand staff perspectives through weekly rounds. In one case, he listened to nurses express resistance to a new process for end-of-shift patient handoffs. The old handoff process was simply a private conversation between two nurses; but the new way included a “bedside shift report” that included the patient in the nurses’ conversation. Many nurses thought the new process took much longer and hindered the exchange of information.

The CEO addressed their concerns by focusing on the improvement in patient care. He highlighted that with the new process, patients were more engaged in their care and better understood the need for medications or procedures, which in turn affected the ultimate outcome of patient health. He reminded the nurses that good patient care was central to the hospital’s values and why most of them became caregivers. Once the nurses accepted the rationale, the focus of the conversation shifted to logistical barriers that kept them from adopting this change (e.g., what to do if the patient is asleep at shift change). Alignment of common values enabled and motivated them to work through this change adoption together.

Engage employees with data to explain the problem, its urgency, and how to address it. Data and metrics can create an awareness of problems, a means to explore them, and a goal post to measure progress. Let’s look at a problem shared by many health care organizations — health care-associated infections. Based on data from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), on any given day, about one in 25 hospital patients gets at least one health care-associated infection. A common cause is poor hand hygiene: The CDC suggests that, on average, health care providers clean their hands less than half of the times they should.

The leader of a large integrated hospital system shared with us how they used data to change existing norms and routines and drive more hand washing. The hospital assigned “stealth monitors” — employees at various levels and roles who worked across several units and covertly collected observational data at set times. A safety group collated this data by unit and included it in a posted weekly report.

During morning huddles, unit and division leaders shared the data and started conversations about potential reasons behind the numbers. This weekly dialogue not only kept the problem in the forefront, but also engaged employees in diagnosing the barriers and factors outside of their control that made change hard to implement.

In one discussion, employees shared that when the batteries in the hand sanitizer dispensers died, it decreased handwashing until workers from another floor could replace the batteries. A simple change of moving spare batteries to the units and allowing anyone to replace them eliminated a critical barrier to improving adoption. This combination of data, engaging staff in problem-solving, and appealing to the mission of good patient care drove the rate of handwashing from 45% to 82% in one year.

Pay attention to the behaviors you reward and tolerate. As part of the same hand washing initiative, hospital system administrators created a Speak Up program, which empowers and trains nurses, staff, and doctors to call out anyone failing to wash their hands, on the spot, as they moved from patient to patient. For the campaign to work, no one, regardless of level or status, was immune from a reminder to wash his or her hands. Engrained cultural norms and power relationships about speaking up needed to be shaken (e.g., technicians were empowered to remind surgeons to wash their hands).

The weekly huddle meetings became a time to acknowledge those who bucked the existing power norms and reinforce the new behaviors. At these, the CMO handed out Starbucks gift cards to the staff that spoke up to physicians and others when they did not wash their hands. Rewarding new behaviors that contradicted the existing norms reinforced the message that it is safe to act in new ways. The change would not stick if doctors were exempt from feedback about noncompliance.

Doctors were also encouraged to thank anyone who spoke up to them when they forgot to wash their hands. When physicians negatively reacted to feedback from staff and resisted the culture change, an administrator reached out to them. The administrator reminded the physician of everyone’s responsibility for patient health, often using an emotional appeal: “How would they feel if their family member was seen by staff that did not engage in healthy hygiene?” Their comments linked physician behavior to the shared core values of high quality patient care.

The status quo persists when bad behaviors at any level of the organization are tolerated. When leadership understands that turning a blind eye to one bad behavior can decimate the adoption of innovation by others, they may be more willing to hold difficult conversations with the highest-status employees in their organization.

As health care continues to transform, aligning new innovations with existing cultural values will make it easier to lead successful change initiatives. Seeking to understand staff perspectives, using data, and holding all employees accountable for patient safety and care will help providers understand how change can support, rather than contradict, the values they hold dear.",
"Fears of China seem to grow every day – as an economic and technological rival as well as for its military prowess. One poll, sponsored by the firm Axios, found that almost two-thirds of Americans fear China’s growing economic power and that an only slightly smaller proportion fear its technological success. A recent gathering of prominent Silicon Valley venture capitalists expressed concern that by 2020 China will overtake the United States in the development of super computers and artificial intelligence, especially self-driving vehicles. Though there can be little doubt of China’s high ambitions and rapid progress, it would be a mistake, with apologies to George Patton, “to take council from our fears.” Realism requires more perspective.

To be sure, genuine economic concerns exist. China is growing much faster than the United States, some 6-6½% a year in real terms. At that rate, it will still take China a long time to overtake the United States, but there is no denying that at such a growth pace China is quickly amassing economic power. Legitimate concerns also arise from China’s less than fair trade policies. Foreign interests, for instance, need a Chinese partner to enter that economy and often have to relinquish technological and commercial secrets as well. Meanwhile China is buying U.S. companies rapidly. Beijing also clearly wants to alter, if not upend existing global economic arrangements. It has claimed large parts of the East and South China Seas, imposing on its neighbors and implicitly if not explicitly threatening trade flows. Its so-called “One Belt-One Road” program to link Asian trade with the Middle East and Europe by land certainly would change trade patterns and does threaten Chinese dominance, as does China’s heavy official investing elsewhere in Asia and in Africa. Its Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank would seem to fit with such efforts. Vice President Mike Pence in a recent talk at the Hudson Institute summarized these concerns and identified them as good reason to contain China.

Without downplaying any of this, it would nonetheless be easy to exaggerate the dangers involved. Take, for example, the question of Chinese ownership in this country.  Many resist Chinese purchases for fear that it would give Beijing powerful influence. Ownership would of course extend Chinese economic power, but popular fears seem to go further, suggesting that somehow Chinese ownership could thwart U.S. policy. In this it pays to remind ourselves that ownership is not sovereignty. No firm, regardless of its ownership, can violate laws or regulations in the jurisdiction where it resides much less actively frustrate government policy. Analogous fears seem associated with the Confucius Institutes sponsored by Beijing on American campuses. Their propaganda might confuse some students and maybe convince some that Chinese practices are superior to their American equivalents, but that would hardly distinguish these institutes from any number of other groups on campus promoting alternative practices and beleifs. Beyond this, the Confucius Institutes could hardly prepare a fifth column movement, as some of the most fearful claim. That would require more discipline than they could possibly organize, especially without a leak.

It also helps to question if not doubt the motives of groups who warn of China’s technological prowess. Take, for instance, the popular Silicon Valley forecast of China’s ability to overtake the United States in certain vital areas. Such fears were on display this past spring a gathering of prominent tech venture capitalists hosted by the Churchill Club. Typical was the assertion by Sequoia Capital that “in the next three to five years’ time, we will wake up to realize that China is far ahead of the U.S. and Silicon Valley.” Just about all the other participants agreed. It is not just the tech firms. The National Science Foundation, the NSA and the Department of Energy have also issued similar warnings. Their conclusions may be valid, but it is nonetheless also worth noting that all these warnings arrive with demands for more spending, especially by Washington, to meet the challenge, money flows that would benefit the parities making these forecasts. That reality does not mean their claims are untrue, but it does raise the need for further investigation before rushing to meet the challenge these groups describe in the way that they prescribe.

It is not even apparent that Chinese technological gains would necessarily threaten the United States or its industry. After all, China has gained from American innovations and found ways to apply them at least as fast as this country. So have other countries that are less inclined than China to steal intellectual capital. There is every reason to believe that this country could do the same with innovations made elsewhere. To be fair to the gathering of venture capitalists in Silicon Valley, one participant, Cowen, made just this point, arguing that technology is far from a winner-take-all activity and that innovation in China would benefit economies and consumers everywhere. Indeed, if history is any guide, innovation, wherever it occurs, tends to inspire further innovation as others apply it to their particular circumstances.

What is most interesting about those who promote such fears is how they tend to characterize China’s weaknesses as strengths. The NSA’s statements are indicative. They emphasize how Beijing subsidizes semiconductor production and demands technology transfers before firms can enter the Chinese market. The venture capitalists and their Silicon Valley associates at the Churchill conference similarly pointed to how the “Chinese government and the Chinese tech leaders are marching in lockstep towards innovation” and how this fact “combined with a national focus on key technologies like AI and autonomous vehicles” will swamp U.S. efforts. To be sure, concerted efforts can make great strides, but should innovation shift, as is its tendency, such a “lockstep” emphasis can miss the change much more readily than the less directed approach used in the United States and elsewhere in the West. When that happens, those following the orchestrated, top-down march waste effort and misuse of resources, financial as well as physical and intellectual.  Certainly China has fallen into this trap before, which is why it still has empty cities and carries an excess of debt used to finance that now clearly pointless effort.

The whole picture is reminiscent of this country’s fear of Japan in the 1980s and early 1990s. Back then, many in business and in government extolled the close cooperation between Japan’s government, particularly its Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) and Japanese industry to direct that country’s innovation and investment efforts. Then President Bill Clinton led in such thinking. That cooperation, he and others widely claimed, would supplant this country’s technological and economic edge. For much the same reason, a 1980s study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) saw most useful economic effort migrating to Japan. In 1985, Theodore H. White, the Pulitzer prize-winning author wrote in the New York Times of “The Danger from Japan.” The Atlantic wondered if the United State could “contain Japan.” The anxiety became so intense that members of Congress compromised their dignity (a modicum of which still existed at the time) by smashing Japanese electronics on the steps of the Capitol. Japan, however, failed to triumph, in large part if not entirely because its concerted efforts missed the changing direction of innovation, the same sort of concerted efforts that so many now fear in China.

None of this is to say that China will go the way of Japan. But it does show that similar fears to those that grip the country today have gripped it falsely in the past. Perhaps China will prove more flexible and succeed where Japan failed. Even then, the nature of innovation suggests that this country can benefit from gains elsewhere, including China, and even improve on them. Meanwhile, China’s efforts to use its growing economic and diplomatic strength to upset existing relationships have met with as much failure as success. Its huge investments in Africa, for instance, have begun evoke African fears of a “new colonialism.” Many in Asia complain about Chinese bullying and have refused Chinese development money. China presents many concerns, to be sure, but today’s fears exaggerate Beijing’s strength while minimizing its task of gaining the dominance many believe is eminent.",
"Have you ever noticed that there are never enough seats for passengers at airports?

Many are forced to mill around because, well, what else are you going to do?

You don't expect, however, airport staff to instruct you on the milling-around rules. Nor, indeed, on the sleeping-at-the-airport rules.

Some passengers flew in from elsewhere late at night and didn't have a connecting flight until the next morning.

What are passengers supposed to do all night? Wouldn't you try to get some sleep?

The UK's Metro describes how passengers tried to find any perch they could to get a few winks.

But when there are only 50 seats and perhaps 500 passengers, there's only one option: the floor.

I've done it before. Perhaps you have too. You try and find a corner, lie down, grip your valuables and hope no one bothers you.

I even saw a young couple sitting together on the ground and when the woman tried to rest her head on her boyfriend's chest and stretch her legs security came up and prodded her into an upright position.

We don't allow people to sleep on the floor or come with sleeping equipment (camp beds, hammocks, sleeping bags etc), and people sleeping on the floor will be asked to sit up or move if necessary.

How very reasonable when there's hardly a chair to be had.

Why, in fact, doesn't the airport start charging for chairs? I'm sure U.S. airlines can offer them software for that.

Stansted has banned sleeping on the floor between midnight and 2 a.m. This, it claims, is to accommodate renovation work and, as the airport told the Telegraph:

Feedback shows passengers don't like arriving at the airport for an early flight to find lots of people blocking access and getting in the way of both staff and those traveling.

Is it also reasonable, though, to prod people awake when they have nowhere else to go and they're not doing any harm?

Stansted says too many travelers deliberately decide to sleep on the floor, so they don't have to pay for a hotel.

On the people's foghorn, Twitter, passengers offered reasonable arguments. There's just nowhere to go in that airport.

Perhaps one idea for passengers is to avoid Stansted altogether.

Until, that is, the renovations are done and the reception is gloriously welcoming.

Should both things ever occur, that is.",

"I consider myself lucky for many reasons. Among them is the chance I’ve had to serve as a board member, trustee, advisor and/or investor with a number of companies and charities. Their focus has ranged from the spirits industry and other consumer products to civic, educational and charitable institutions.

Oversight for an organization from a board’s bird’s-eye point of view — being able to see what works and what doesn’t — has taught me a lot. One truth I’ve learned is that a founder isn’t necessarily the ideal leader going forward. Entrepreneurial invention isn’t the same as leadership skill.

It’s important for any organization to ensure that the right people have the right skill sets. As a company or institution evolves, its leaders must evolve, too. Sometimes a board has to intervene — just part of its responsibility — to ensure that change occurs for the well-being of a company and its shareholders.

Elon Musk is obviously a brilliant guy and a genuine visionary. Not only is he the CEO of Tesla, Inc., but among other ventures, he founded and heads SpaceX to enable the colonization of Mars. He’s also a co-founder of PayPal and more.

But being able to invent and envision doesn’t automatically make Musk a leader. Leadership requires many important skills, including judgment. If I were on his board, we’d actively be discussing what it says that he was smoking marijuana during a globally available podcast, thereby affecting the public image of himself and his brand. There's also the allegations of unsafe standards at Tesla’s California factory, which came after the death of a motorist using the company’s driving-assistance software. And there's Musk’s failed attempt to take Tesla private and the departure of executives who no longer wanted to work with him. None of that helps the image of a leader’s publicly traded stock.

Musk is only one example. Some make international news and others are visible only to board members like me. One you probably heard of involved Travis Kalanick, former CEO of Uber, the peer-to-peer ridesharing, taxi cab and delivery service.   Uber has been changing our sense of how rides and deliveries can be handled these days.

But, all too famously, Kalanick made news in early 2017 by losing his cool with one of his own Uber drivers. In a video captured on dash cam, the founder, who was in the backseat as a passenger, exploded with anger when the driver told Kalanick that employees didn't trust him anymore and complained about falling rates.

Kalanick made a public apology, apologized to the driver by name and wrote to the public: “This is the first time I’ve been willing to admit that I need leadership help and I intend to get it.” I give Kalanick credit for acknowledging his own lack of leadership skill and his need to improve.

There are many examples of excellent thought leaders whose visions did not easily or automatically transfer into being effective organizational leaders. Apple CEO Steve Jobs has long been controversial in that regard. Certainly, people can grow.  Current Apple CEO Tim Cook has said that Jobs matured significantly during the later part of his career.

Even if you’re the founder and creative brains behind an amazing innovation, you need to know when it’s time to step away and let the professionals handle management. Successful team leadership requires different skills than dreaming up phenomenal innovations.

Here are a few thoughts I’d offer any founder as your business begins to grow:

• It’s clear that even Steve Jobs, as brilliant as he was with technology, was less comfortable with people. With more insight into himself, he may have come to that realization on his own. If he had proactively turned the management of the business over to someone else with proven leadership skills in a larger organization, who knows what else he could have achieved?

Founder, start with an honest look in the mirror, putting ego aside. If the person looking back at you isn’t as comfortable with leadership as they are with creative innovation, give the reins to someone else.

• Seek the opinion of those you trust around you with management experience beyond your own. Make sure they understand they won’t be penalized for their honesty. There are many options today for “360-degree feedback” research tools — surveys that provide anonymity to respondents in order to give a leader truthful feedback.

• Include members on your board who have experienced success in leading large organizations. Then be willing to learn from them!

All I can tell you, whether you’re an entrepreneur or a senior exec, is that everything I’ve learned from my experience on boards confirms what we’ve seen in business news: It’s never automatic that a great thinker is a great leader. Ultimately, the board must ensure that an organization is well-run, starting at the top.

My suggestion is to keep this learning in mind, whether for your own career path or for any organization you influence. For me, it’s been a helpful realization.",
"Today, every brand needs to be self-sufficient to survive in this winner-takes-all economy. Each brand needs to own the relationship with its customers so they can provide a better experience and more competitive prices. A brand that cannot survive without Amazon, Facebook, Google or Apple does not have a standalone brand, but rather is at the mercy of the digital giants, who can change the rules of the game at any time.

In my opinion, the best indicator of brand strength is not brand perception; it is the level of organic traffic to the brand site or store -- the number of people searching for your brand without the need for paid advertising. As more consumers move to ad-free platforms and adopt ad-block technologies, the big question remains: How do you build a modern brand today?

There are three types of brand relationships we'll be discussing in this article: direct-to-consumer (DTC), indirect and hybrid. Each requires a different operational model.

DTC brands are product-led businesses. They tend to be born online, focus on delivering the best product experience with a clear value proposition and use their customers as their sales force. DTC brands are always in beta mode and continually improve their experience based on customer feedback, so data is at the core of their business. These businesses provide value to customers by cutting out the intermediary and passing the savings to customers. Think about Casper, Warby Parker, Native and Away as a few examples.

DTC brands are also not dependent on the likes of Facebook, Amazon and Walmart to survive. This doesn't mean they don't leverage these platforms, but they also tend to use tactics like growth hacking, providing a free trial or a very generous return policy to eliminate any purchase risk. Their sole focus is on delivering the best experience to customers. The more significant challenge is to break through the clutter, scalability and trust.

In my opinion, DTC brands have the best shot at surviving in this new environment given their ability to adapt faster than any other type of brand. They have a direct feedback loop with customers that allows them to continually improve their experience.

Indirect brands are the ones we buy exclusively at retail (offline or digital). Think about CPG brands like Pepsi, Gatorade, Heinz, Dove, etc. They have relied on traditional advertising as their main engine of growth. Indirect brands can scale faster than DTC brands through the retail distributing channel. Their model is to create a strong association in consumers' minds so that they get chosen at the point of sale.

Their biggest challenge is that they often don't have direct relationships with customers. This means they are at the mercy of Amazon, Walmart or even social platforms. Retailers such as Amazon and Walmart can create and prioritize their own private labels. Social media platforms can change their algorithms, as they have done in the past, which impacts a brand's organic or even paid reach.

In my opinion, indirect brands face the biggest survival threat, given they don't have a direct feedback loop with customers, for the most part. They take more time to catch up to today's evolving consumer expectations. Therefore, indirect brands age faster than direct brands, as they cannot move at the speed of the customer.

To create a better relationship with customers, indirect brands could develop stronger partnerships with retailers for full access to customer data in real time, both in-store and online. For instance, if you are selling ketchup at Walmart or Amazon, you want to have real-time access on who is buying and what, when, how and where they're purchasing across the entire category. The goal is to use this data to improve your offering in terms of releasing new products, updating prices and creating new content.

Hybrid brands live in two worlds: direct and retail. We see them very often with traditional CPG brands that are trying to change their business models. Today, some of the major CPG companies (e.g., P&G Shop, Nestlé and Unilever) are starting to sell directly to consumers in some regions while continuing their presence in the retail channels.

Selling directly to consumers can provide recurring revenue to CPG companies. In addition, it gives them a faster way to test ideas and get consumer feedback before deciding to go to retail. Launching a product in the retail channel takes almost a year.

Hybrid brands, in theory, might get the best of both worlds: the scale of the retail channel and the test-and-learn of the direct channels. That said, there is always a trade-off in life. For instance, they might not be able to pass the savings of going direct-to-consumer, as they have to pay the retail channels and allocate a significant budget for advertising. Plus, they are in direct competition with retailers, which can create a ""frenemy"" relationship. This means that retailers might be sensitive to share data with hybrid brands or give them any preference at the point of sale.

My advice for brands that want to go hybrid is to have a clear value proposition for the direct channel. In other words, customers need to get something that they are not getting at the retail level (e.g., new products, savings or faster delivery) to justify the direct relationship. Otherwise, they are going to have a hard time convincing people to buy direct when it is easier and costs the same to buy through the retail channel.

Hence, as we look at these three models, it is becoming clear that DTC brands have more survival chances in the long run compared to other models. To be a customer-centric brand, you need to have a direct relationship with your customers.",
"One of the most effective ways to foster an inclusive environment is the utilization of employee resource groups (ERGs). ERGs are employee-led groups that are formed based on specific traits that group members possess. ERGs could be focused on race, gender, religion or any other defining characteristics that group members share. ERGs can have several positive effects on the organization including reduced turnover rates, encouraging organizational goal achievement, and increased productivity rates within the organization. How can ERGs be implemented in an organization, in order to achieve maximum results and create a culture of inclusion? Teach For All is a company that has mastered the art of creating a successful and thriving ERG. What can be learned from Teach For All in order to successfully implement an ERG in your workplace?

1. Leadership buy-in. While it is not mandatory to have buy-in from senior leaders, it certainly helps with ERG implementation. The resource group should also have an executive sponsor, which ideally will be someone who holds a leadership position within the organization. Abby Nance is the manager of diversity projects and communications at Teach For All and was instrumental in the creation of a gender equity ERG at Teach For All. Nance indicates that while you don’t need senior leadership for the ERG to be successful, leadership buy-in is beneficial to propel the ERG.

2. Assess company needs and set goals. After getting buy-in from leadership, it is necessary to assess the organization and decide which ERGs are needed. Which diverse groups are represented or underrepresented in the organization? Is your company having trouble recruiting women? Are there retention issues with millennial employees? Are you looking to attract Black and Hispanic employees? Figuring out which ERGs to develop is based on company needs. Once you have determined which ERG(s) is needed, then it is time for goal setting. When creating an ERG, you must establish what you are hoping to accomplish with the ERG. What are the goals with the creation of the group? You should be very specific as far as the group’s purpose and objectives. ERG goals will be contingent on the company goals and needs. Be sure ERG goals are aligned with organizational goals to maximize ERG success.

3. Start small. Nance indicates that it’s okay to start out small at first. “You don’t need significant numbers to start—it may be quite small at the beginning, but if it’s filling a need for you, then that’s fine. You can grow with time.” It is also beneficial to have allies in the group, which are individuals that do not necessarily share the group’s characteristics, but are passionate about the group, want to learn more and want to show their support.

4. Advertise the group. In order for others to be aware that an ERG has been created, the group should be advertised. This can be done through the intranet of the company or internal documents such as the organizational newsletter. Nance shares that at Teach For All, “to get initial involvement, we advertised it as part of new employees’ onboarding plans and through individual teams’ newsletters. We also have a diversity, equity, and inclusiveness Slack channel…so whenever we have an upcoming call or meeting, we will also advertise there and invite anyone who would like to join.”

After you have successfully implemented an ERG into your organization, the last piece of the puzzle is measurement. Quantitative data such as retention rates, employee engagement levels, and promotion rates should be measured before and after ERG implementation to understand how the ERG(s) are impacting the organization.",
"If your employer operates on the calendar year, the last quarter is when you finish this year’s goals, plan for next year, and complete your annual performance review. If you had a strong year, then you want to take advantage of review time to ask for what you want, need and deserve for next year. Part 2 of this series will focus on how to maximize a good performance year.

However, if you are not feeling confident about how this past year unfolded, you need to be ready for a difficult conversation in case you receive a bad performance review. Here are five common scenarios for why you might get a negative performance review and strategies for how to improve your situation:

Scenario 1: You made an obvious mistake on the job

A client you’re managing complained, or worse, stopped doing business with you. A project you led wasn’t well-received. A report you presented had incorrect information. Mistakes on the job happen, so don’t assume any one mistake will tank your entire performance review. However, you should prepare as if the mistake will impact how you’re evaluated and will be discussed during the review meeting.

Itemize other accomplishments overall to put the one mistake in a broader context. In addition:

Scenario 2: You have not met your success metrics

Some companies itemize clear objectives for their employees and the metrics for how they measure success for those objectives. Many sales roles have this built into their compensation structure, but some companies extend this format to non-sales roles. The engineering team is measured on project delivery. The customer service team is measured on satisfaction survey results. The finance team is measured on cost savings to the company.

If you didn’t hit your success metrics for the year, hopefully you have been working with your manager throughout the year to try and correct the situation. If your manager is already aware of and helping with your struggles, then the annual review may just be another coaching session for how to improve for next year. However, it might also be when your manager delivers an ultimatum and sets a time-limit for improvement or else…. In this case, your performance review opens the door for you to lose your job over poor performance.

If you want to keep your job and still think you can meet your goals, then use the performance review to ask for what you need – additional time, training, support from colleagues or your manager . If you don’t think this job is right for you, then this would be a good meeting to ask for a transfer to another group or to negotiate for a severance package. Don’t assume that just because you didn’t meet expectations that the company will not help you. The company may offer outplacement support, and your manager individually may offer leads or even introductions, especially if you got along personally and performed well at other parts of your job.

Scenario 3: Your boss has been critical

It’s easier to prepare for a negative performance review when you know what you did wrong, but it’s trickier when your boss is critical of you and you’re not quite sure why. If your boss is regularly critical and critical of most everyone, then your performance review may still be fine. However, if you think your boss doesn’t like you specifically and this is different than before or has gotten worse over time, then prepare for a negative review.

Try to identify the source of your boss’ discontent and prepare a plan for how to improve in that area. For example, if your boss doesn’t like the way you summarize at your weekly meetings, then put communication skills training or more specifically presentation skills training in your action plan. If you can’t find a pattern in how your boss criticizes you, then ask for clarity at the review (ideally beforehand but certainly by review time). Many people avoid giving feedback, so don’t expect your boss to be forthcoming with specifics. You will have to ask explicitly, “I notice you have been critical of my weekly summaries. Should I use a different format? What can I improve?”

Scenario 4: You only sense something is wrong

Let’s say your boss has been giving you ongoing feedback that everything is fine, but you still don’t feel fine. If you’re a natural worrier, you might just be imagining the negativity as part of your everyday anxiety. However, if you didn’t worry about your work performance before but you more recently feel like something isn’t right, then you might have picked up on something.

If you have a trusted colleague or mentor in the same group or who knows your group, see if they are sensing something similar. Even talking it out with someone else will force you to outline what is wrong and bring more specificity to the problem, which you can then try and fix. You can also start a journal of your observations to try and capture more specifics going forward. For the performance review itself, if you haven’t identified the root cause of your worry, prepare as if it will be a good review and then listen intently at the feedback.

There may be negativity around you that isn’t caused by you or immediately affecting you, such as the company changing leadership, restructuring operations and/ or adopting new strategies. This may still impact your performance review negatively. If your areas of focus are not as important to the company, then your work can be perceived as average because the company just doesn't care as much. If your manager is on the outs, their influence on your career next steps or immediate raise or bonus can also be diminished.

Since you can’t be sure if or how company changes will impact your performance review, prepare as if you’re getting a good review but bring your questions. Your manager may not openly share what they know or have heard, but if you ask privately and in the spirit of career planning, then they might make an exception and give you a heads-up on what is going on. The performance review could give you a head start if you should be looking for a new job or a transfer or refocusing your work on other priorities.

Keep in mind that, if the performance review hasn’t been written yet, you can still turn a negative situation around . Prepare for how the performance review meeting may unfold. Prepare what you would like to ask or discuss and what you would like your manager to know about your accomplishments, ideas and plans. However, spend the bulk of your time proactively improving your work performance, not the performance review.",
"A hard-charging sales guy named Mike jumps out of a plane dressed in a tux. He drives an Aston Martin to a martini class with his girlfriend who is dressed like a 1960s goddess. He and his co-workers have a thing for 007 films and he just annihilated his sales goal for this quarter.

This kind of reward may not appeal to Jenny, a 40-something mom of four who works in the marketing department, but oh boy - did it work for Mike and his sales buddies. Although his name has been changed to protect the innocent, Mike is an actual guy who came back to work on Monday geared up to make even more sales in the following quarter.

Nothing is more personal and impactful than the way you experience your own life. We each have our own perception of how the world works based on how we live and what we feel.

Decades of economic evolution are leading us to realize that experiences that are personal and memorable can help us acquire and retain clients and customers as well as recruit and retain top talent.

Let’s go back in time to understand.

An Agrarian economy is where we started. We harvested, extracted and pulled things out of the earth and sold them solely based on price and they were a commodity. This went on for nearly a millennia until the industrial revolution. We then took these commodities and manufactured, packaged and processed them into goods to get a higher price. Unfortunately, goods have now been commoditized and decisions are once again based on price, price, price. Continuing to innovate and adapt, we started to deliver services with the goods and we were then able to differentiate – and command an even higher price.

With the internet boom over 20 years ago, even service-based industries have commoditized. When was the last time you called a travel agent? Never; we all go to the internet and use Priceline or Kayak to make our decisions on, you guessed it - price, price, price. In response, we have now evolved into the Experience Economy, but even within this realm, there is a difference between experiences.

What happens today when you provide: (1) a personalized solution that is (2) customized to exactly what your client needs; and (3) wants at exactly the right time?

They are not only impressed, but they have also just experienced something so memorable and personalized that you have developed a much deeper relationship that will keep them coming back. This type of experience, crafted to the needs and interests of the person, is no longer is about saving time and great customer service; it is about time well spent.

Time is the one thing we can’t make more of so when you can elicit that reaction to the experience, the discussion is no longer about price but value.

Employees must thrive at work in order to deliver this customer experience. The employee experience must be a priority because it dictates the company's culture. The company culture determines the customer experience.

Employee experience is everything an employee sees, feels, observes and experiences throughout their journey at an organization. This includes culture, the technology, and the environment. According to Accenture, employers with a great employee experience outperform the S&P 500 Index by 122%. It is not just theory and happy thoughts.

A stellar employee experience means understanding employees' needs, interests, barriers, and challenges. GenZ and Millenials may crave development and growth opportunities; Boomers may be dealing with elder care issues. People don’t check their personal lives at the door when they come to work. True leaders offer programs, benefits, and a great culture to help them optimize their potential both at work and home by treating them with a humanistic approach.

Many organizations are prioritizing the employee experience and seeing savings and time and money well spent on recruiting, retaining top talent in the process, and inspiring the best out of their people.

Therein lies these companies' marketplace advantage. Employees feel great and customers get the resultant extraordinary experience.

Consider employees' needs; learn about their barriers. What is happening in their respective personal lives that your company might support? Employees cannot create a customer experience if they are not themselves having a thriving workplace experience.

Take the steps. Consider doing a cultural need and interest audit of your employees. Connect, in a new and powerful way, with your people. Your customers will feel it.",
"I'll be the first to admit that I've had problematic relationships in my own business. And because I am the furthest thing from an expert on this topic, when my business and the people within it started to become affected, I hired an expert to help me out.

Specifically, I hired Dr. Patty Ann Tublin--a world-renowned business relationship and communication expert. Dr. Tublin is a clinical psychologist, best-selling author, and speaker who coaches and consults with business partners and owners, married couples, and corporate executives. She helps them maintain healthy relationships in their professional and personal lives.

Dr. Tublin swears by three simple--yet highly effective--strategies that anyone can use to repair a damaged relationship or bolster an existing one. I asked her to dive into this, and here's what she said.

1. You need to rebuild trust

The common thread among all damaged relationships is the trust between both parties has been broken. Trust is the underrated lubricant for success in business, and rebuilding that trust is the first step in repairing any business relationship.

So how can you rebuild trust once it's been damaged? The fact of the matter is that you can only change and control your own behaviors and thoughts. As much as you'd like to, you cannot change the way your partner (or anyone else) acts. However, if you can change yourself, that will, in turn, effect a change in your partner's behavior.

2. You need to establish effective communication

Effective communication is a no-brainer in any relationship. But people often forget there is one goal--and one goal only--when communicating with people. You have to connect. It's not about convincing or persuading.

3. You need to have a mature level of emotional intelligence

No matter how level-headed you might think you are, everyone has ""those"" moments. The moment when you say something that, to put it lightly, isn't helping the situation. You need to maintain a mature level of emotional intelligence so you are in control of your emotions, rather than having your emotions control you--especially when you are angry.",
"Board-level crises are not always discrete events that lend themselves to “happy endings.” Increasingly, they seem to linger, and to cast a sustained cloud over the governance process. And the most viral seeds of crisis have a nasty habit of spawning collateral dysfunction, for which boards must (reluctantly) anticipate and prepare.

That seems to be the central message of the long-running drama involving the CBS board—at least as described in media reports. It’s a board that appears to be dealing with the significant aftershocks of not just one, but two successive crises—and devolving into internal dysfunction as a result. And it is a type of dysfunction that even the best populated, most-informed and best advised, boards can’t readily spot and comfortably avoid.

You’re probably familiar with the script. “Crisis #1” was the unusually contentious litigation between the company and its controlling shareholder. “Crisis #2,” arriving in the midst of the litigation, was the series of allegations of sexual misconduct levied against the company’s prominent and successful chief executive officer. With the help of experienced outside advisors, the board brokered something of an omnibus settlement. The shareholder litigation was resolved by a restructuring of the board, while the misconduct allegations were resolved (as a governance issue) with the negotiated departure of the CEO.

But, apparently, the curtain didn’t fully close. According to media reports, the settlement left (or exacerbated existing) tensions within the board. For example, the lead independent director resigned, reportedly feeling his authority compromised by the board’s decision to name an interim chairman. Another prominent director resigned, reportedly due to his displeasure at being characterized in the media as leading advocate for the exiting CEO. And the litigation itself had reportedly created factions amongst the board.

The internal investigation initiated to review allegations against the CEO expanded to examine individual board member conduct during the crises. Indeed, all directors have been interviewed in the process - always a pleasant fiduciary experience. Controversy arose concerning information disclosed during the course of the investigation to key board committees, but ultimately not to the full board. The open seats created by the director resignations will apparently not be filled in the near future, with the potential for affecting further negotiations with the controlling shareholder. And through it all, the company searches for a new CEO (perhaps the most important of board responsibilities).

Lessons learned? That board-level dysfunction is a natural byproduct of crisis, best avoided by a combination of anticipation (of the risk) and preserving an environment of governance cohesiveness while “in the moment.” And that cohesiveness can be supported by respectful discourse; confidentiality of board discussions (i.e., no leaks); truly informed decision-making; formal appreciation of individual director contributions; and accountability for deficient individual director conduct. Effective leadership, of course, being the key.

Indeed, the value of such cohesiveness is underscored by the newly released “Commonsense Principles 2.0”. This update to the influential 2016 governance guidance stresses the importance of collaboration and collegiality to a well-functioning board, and the dangers associated with director conduct that is divisive or self-serving.

When it comes to chaos-driven board dysfunction, it is never over until it is over, and even then, maybe not so. Especially when the board (like CBS) has to endure a powerful one-two punch in terms of challenges. In those situations, board leadership may hope for the best, but must anticipate the worst in terms of board solidarity. And be prepared to meet that challenge.",
"Ellen Pompeo is fired up. She's fired up and she's unapologetic about it and she's wearing the chicest blue power suit you've ever seen while her daughter Stella is snacking on gummy bears and smiling a smile as big as the moon as she watches her mother straight talk a room full of powerful women about how to be even more powerful.

""We’re taught if we’re not bitches we aren’t going to be taken seriously. But we need to be bitches to the men not the women,"" Pompeo says. ""Start talking to each other. Stop blaming each other.""

This room likes everything Pompeo says. They nod and whoop and cheer and pinch one another, almost like they're trying to figure out if this is a dream. Imagine, a Hollywood actress actually telling it like it is. Pompeo has been telling it like it is for awhile now, but it's one thing to read about it and it's an entirely different thing to see it right in front of you.

""As women we’re not taught to be brave and celebrate ourselves. We’re taught to be quiet and shy and not brag about who we are and what we make. It’s time to start bragging,"" she continues onstage to the rapt audience at Marie Claire's annual Power Trip conference.

Bragging is celebrated at the Power Trip which brought a hundred powerful women in business, tech and Hollywood together for 36 hours in San Francisco to brag and chat and connect.

The idea of the Power Trip is to transcend the traditional conference and allow women to collide and collaborate. Pompeo is currently living that ethos. She wants women to talk and once they start she doesn't want them to stop.

""One of the most important things we’ve learned in the past year in Hollywood is that we need to start speaking to each other. In Hollywood we were not in a culture of being able to talk to each other,"" Pompeo says. ""We  need to ask other women, 'what are you making?' 'what did he do to you?' 'This is what they're paying me.' 'This is what he did.' We need to share with each other everything we know because there’s power in numbers. We should believe women and support women and defend women and protect each other because the men are not going to protect us.""

Pompeo's advice represents the new breed of advice for how women can help other women. And it was really just the tip of the iceberg during the Power Trip. Here's some of the best advice we gathered from this crowd of wildly inspiring women about how to actually lift up other women.

""Call on them. Ask for their feedback in meetings. Give them opportunities to lead new projects. Proactively identify ways to call them out for their wins, like in a team-wide Slack note. It will help us all get more comfortable embracing our successes, not just anticipating our potential failures.""

""The stories we tell matter. The people telling them matter. Together we are stronger. Together we will change the world.""

“Connect a woman to another woman that can help her - it’s all about connecting.”

""Lead with respect and compassion for other women.  Be more inclusive and befriend women who are different than yourself!"" ""I find ‘women supporting women’ an honorable goal but somewhat daunting in its generality. Start with the specific. Start with the women you know and know how to help. Make an introduction you think could be useful. Give a meaningful compliment. It matters. Women are always so busy trying to problem solve we rarely stop to make sure we ourselves are okay. Check in with the women in your immediate circle. Cultivate your own community."" ""Make a conscious effort to help one to two women within the next 12 months and really follow through. It’s not enough to take meetings with junior women.  Go the extra mile to help them reach their next milestone — listen, dig, plot and build together.  Set regular checkpoints and closely follow their progress. We will see more women in senior positions when we all work collectively as a team, roll our sleeves, and fully dive in. As the saying goes, it takes a village to educate a child and it takes a village to see more women in senior positions.""

""Create environments that encourage women to raise their voices.  We all know how it feels to be in a meeting or group, and not feel ""heard"" despite our best attempts.The simple and intentional act of reinforcing women's comments, highlighting their ideas and creating spaces that feel supportive can go a long way."" ""One of the highlights of my career thus far has been the awesome women I have had the pleasure of meeting. One way we can really help each other out is to SHARE contacts. My business partner Elizabeth and I get a lot of pleasure from sharing out time and the relationships we have cultivated with other women. We are enthusiastic “connectors “.  I think back to when we were starting SoulCycle and how few female entrepreneurs we had to help point us in the right direction. Connecting awesome women with complimentary skill sets who can help each other accomplish big things is a tangible way to support other women.""",
"This past September, my spouse and I launched our oldest child into the K-12 school system. Sending your child off to kindergarten should be an exciting time. Sure, one expects it to be a bit anxiety-provoking but, ultimately, nothing to top your most stressful week at work over the past decade. That was not my family’s experience.

Due to a dysfunctional school lottery system, our son ended up in three different kindergarten classrooms before the end of his second day of kindergarten. While he remained resilient, friendly and curious throughout the ordeal, mom became a hot mess -- but not without good reason.

In the span of just 48 hours, my spouse and I were forced to make a series of tough decisions under pressure and with incomplete information. The decisions we were making would have a significant impact on my son’s life over the next six years, and due to sibling preferences in the public school system, these decisions would also impact our younger daughter’s education in the future. The situation was emotional -- not entirely unlike being in any leadership position.

To get through those 48 hours, my spouse and I had to tap into many of the same leadership capacities we bring to our work. In fact, in the end, our ability to come up with a viable solution was served by skills we have both spent over two decades honing on the job. But I also know that how we now lead our respective companies has also changed since we became parents mid-career. Among other things, being a parent has made both of us more flexible and agile.

Running a company and parenting at the same time is challenging, but skills acquired on the job can help one be a better parent and vice versa. In fact, these activities go hand-in-hand. Here are six qualities that great parents and leaders share:

Life happens, circumstances change and sometimes, we are forced to become more agile. As a parent, agility may be your greatest asset. Just as you get into a parenting rhythm, things invariably change (e.g., your kids let you know that they need to stay up later to finish homework or that they are ready to wander just a bit further from home on their own).

The same thing holds true at work. Just as you get into a work rhythm, someone moves on or announces they need to take time off to pursue another passion. In both cases, fostering agility is essential.

Whether you’re at work or at home, it is important to communicate in a clear and consistent manner. It is especially important to learn how to ask great questions and how and when to ask these questions.

In a recent Harvard Business Review article, Alison Wood Brooks and Leslie K. John observe that “Questioning is a uniquely powerful tool for unlocking value in organizations: It spurs learning and the exchange of ideas, it fuels innovation and performance improvement, it builds rapport and trust among team members.” Early childhood development experts also emphasize the value of asking great questions, specifically highlighting its impact on language acquisition.

Great coaches see the potential in teammates (both at home and work) and proactively work to position each player for success. Rather than solving problems, it is about helping individuals assess a situation, grow on their own and resolve their own problems. Whether this means trusting that your kid will figure something out or letting someone else on your team deliver a mission-critical presentation, the better we are as coaches, the more likely others on our team are to succeed.

We will never be able to prepare our team members or kids for everything. If we set clear expectations and build transparency, however, team members and kids are more likely to know what to do, when to do it and why -- even when we can’t be there offering tips from the sidelines.

On the very first day of school, it turned out what was hard for me wasn’t necessarily hard for my son. While I was flustered and frustrated about my son’s school placement, he was likely concerned with an entirely different can of worms. The same holds true on any team. You never know what other team members are navigating. Having compassion means accepting that you can’t always know exactly what they are going through.

Watching my son drive away on a school bus for the first time reminded me of how little control we have as parents and as leaders. As the bus turned the corner, I saw my little guy frantically slide into an empty seat. For the rest of the day, I wondered about his first school bus ride. Had he arrived? Was he afraid to be alone on the bus?

While it may sound strange to compare a five-year-old’s school bus ride to anything that happens in the workplace, one thing is clear: If you want people to grow, sometimes you need to surrender and give them enough space to actually learn on their own.

After a chaotic and exhausting entry to the school year, my son has landed in a great public school with a highly sought-after Spanish immersion program. He comes home exhausted at the end of each day and excited about all the new words, concepts and people he has encountered. As a parent, learner and leader, I’m excited for him. My son’s school is working out because it reflects our core values as a family -- values that include a commitment to embracing new challenges, taking risks and leading through example.",coaching
"Dr. Eduardo Padrón, President of Miami Dade College (MDC), is a guest contributor for #VoteTogether

Since its inception, America’s democracy has belonged to the people, and its strength and survival are intrinsically linked to a civically conscious and actively engaged society.

Despite the inarguable role individual Americans play in the governance of our great nation, there is recent speculation that younger generations may be somewhat apathetic to our political process. Research indicates young people in the U.S. are growing more pessimistic about the political system and are therefore more disengaged, a worrisome trend that must be reversed for the sake of our country’s future.

At Miami Dade College, fondly referred to by so many as Democracy’s College, we understand the fundamental role higher education plays in motivating students to be informed and active citizens. For decades, via our teaching, community involvement and partnerships, we have brought civic consciousness into the minds and hearts of our students, letting them know that their voices matter and must be heard.

This election season is no different. We have partnered with #VoteTogether, an initiative of Civic Nation aimed at increasing voter participation by organizing thousands of non-partisan, family-friendly celebrations at and near polling locations during early voting and on Election Day. It’s been proven that community celebrations positively impact voter participation by up to four percentage points, and therefore we have encouraged our students and employees to create teams and host events that motivate others to vote. #VoteTogether celebrates our communities, our nation, and our right to vote.

In addition, two of our eight campuses will be official early voting sites in Miami-Dade County beginning October 22, an important step in ensuring our students, employees, and the entire community have convenient access to the polls. This accomplishment was only possible because of the tireless advocacy and perseverance of our students, who lobbied before the Board of County Commissioners last month on the importance of early voting sites at MDC.

Our College’s Institute for Civic Engagement and Democracy remains our powerhouse of civic involvement, and it is especially effective at responding to the unique challenges of our students. Many of them are first-generation, low-income, and under-prepared students, who often work and attend school simultaneously and may place civic engagement at the bottom of their priority list. By collaborating with faculty to infuse civic engagement and democratic learning into the classroom, we are creating a scalable way to reach these students and hopefully making them aware that our country needs them.

This year, all our campuses hosted very successful National Voter Registration Day events, and via grants, we were able to secure external funding to hire 27 students as non-partisan voter engagement interns. Our media services team also put their ingenuity to work and created our “Your Vote is Your Voice” video highlighting the many reasons why every vote counts.

Our efforts will continue as we strive to make civic engagement a priority for the next generation of leaders. Our students represent the future of our country, and creating a love for civic advocacy is the least we can do to ensure they remain engaged and committed citizens of this great nation we call home. Let us turn apathy into action, and create in our youth the understanding that their voice matters. Our country’s future is in their hands and depends on them.",
"Over 70% of employees characterized their relationship with their boss negatively according to a recent Monster poll for National Boss’s Day on Tuesday. Although hardly scientific, the poll is a timely reminder of the power of a boss to make the work experience a good one or a bad one.

As an executive wellness coach, I work with CEOs as well as executives who report directly to the CEO. Seeing this relationship from both sides of the table, I understand how difficult it is to be a CEO and how difficult it is to have a toxic boss. I know that the worse CEO behavior stems from insecurity. Indeed, a survey of 402 CEOs from eleven countries found that only 32% of CEOs felt adequately prepared for the job.

However, overcompensating for insecurity with narcissism or an authoritarian leadership style is not the answer. The top two complaints in the Monster poll—that the boss is power-hungry or micro-manages—mirror what I hear from clients all the time. Insecure CEOs feel threatened by intelligent and independent thinkers and doers. They promote the wrong people while alienating their best people. The result is a toxic environment that can threaten the health of the entire company.

When you alienate your best people, you risk losing them to a competitor. The costs of bad leadership do not end there. Your team’s commitment and loyalty will be out the door before they physically leave, resulting in diminished engagement and productivity that will trickle down to those they supervise.

A company that develops a reputation for high turnover will eventually have trouble attracting and retaining top talent—the greatest cost of a bad boss. Just as a scandal or product recall can damage a brand’s reputation in a way that takes years to undo, a company’s reputation as a good (or bad) place to work is an asset whose value is impossible to put a price on.

Take the ego out of CEO

Some of my clients joke that in their company, CEO stands for Chief Egotistical Officer. These are companies where the CEO has a burning desire to always be right and tend to undermine others so that they can appear to be smarter. They are more likely to start sentences with I than with We when speaking publicly or to shareholders.

By contrast, a recent article in the Wall Street Journal summarizes several studies finding that humility, not ego, is most effective at inspiring teamwork, rapid learning, and high performance. Fortunately, that same article reports, there is a growing recognition of the value of humility for today’s business leader. Next year Hogan Assessments, a leader in designing workplace personality tests, will release a new scale for measuring humility in prospective leaders.

The myth of the charismatic CEO

The CEO Genome Project is a ten-year study that examined thousands of CEOs in search of what makes a successful leader. It concludes that the traditional image of the prototypical CEO as charismatic and autocratic is outdated and in need of serious revision.

The most conscious leaders are builders of bridges and creators of connection. That includes connection between CEOs and top management, management and their teams, employees and their peers. It also includes connection between a brand and its mission, a company, and its customers.

Paradoxically, in a knowledge economy, leaders have less and less of a need to be know-it-alls. The best leaders are generalists who connect specialists with one another. They create an environment for collaboration and innovation and step back instead of dictating what their employees should be doing.

The most critical knowledge for today’s leader is people knowledge, and that begins with self-knowledge.

Humble leaders understand and accept their limitations and admit what they do not know. On that basis, they can seek the help and input they need and delegate freely. This enables them to be generous with their praise as well as financially reward and promote high performers. Their team will be left feeling valued and appreciated and motivated to continue to do their best work. Leaders build a culture that is bigger than they are, and one which will outlast them.

The insecure CEO views power as a finite resource—something to be guarded carefully and shared cautiously if at all. The enlightened CEO, coming from a place of humility and deeper self-assurance, sees power as something to be shared.

When leaders share power, they empower their employees and teams. Another way to look at power is as energy. When leaders empower employees, they energize them. When you give a trusted colleague an idea and let them run with it, you encourage them to invest more than time and effort. You invite them to invest a part of themselves.

In a knowledge economy, energy—the energy of ideas, initiative, and innovation—is a renewable resource. Put faith in your best people and that investment will pay off many times over.",coaching
"Diversity and inclusion (D&I) is a popular corporate topic right now, and for good reason. But while D&I strategies are surely needed, too often, they fall short because they focus only on external differences of gender and race.

Imagine this: All of a sudden, you become blind, and you cannot see the applicant in front of you or the teammate next to you. All you can do is rely on what's being said. Who and why do you hire?

Our recruiting efforts must pay mind to diversity in thought too.

Applying yoga and meditation to my coaching practice, I recognized how hard it was for leaders to shift their views. Until we connect the physical, mental and emotional aspects of a person, worldviews are held in academic thought versus embodied feeling. It's time we go all in using my three steps to an inclusive workplace below.

Hiring diverse applicants is the first step. If you're not reaching outside your core network, get on LinkedIn, visit a college outside of the ones you typically recruit from, or get involved with groups that connect leaders from all over, like Rotary International, which I am a member of myself. Find different, emerging leaders and think bigger.

One of the biggest challenges for mankind is teaching people how to value diverse thought in a day and age when social media conditions the mind to groupthink.

If a D&I program is to be successful, we must be successful at going deeper into our own minds, exploring subconscious thoughts and untruths that prohibit us from asking why:

• Why is this person different from me?

• Why do they think the way they do?

• Why can't I believe what they believe?

• Why am I reacting to what seems right in hiring more diverse applicants?

• Why am I intolerant of views other than the ones I hold so close to me as my truth?

The mind is our greatest tool or greatest weapon in how we relate to ourselves and others. Training people to become mindful leaders is essential to un-layering stigma, bias, racism, etc. Ensure diverse worldviews are not just allowed in your workplace, but that they are valued as a tool for creativity, innovation, market expansion and employee well-being.

Step 3: Share your differences and celebrate your shared successes.

Remember when you were in elementary school and you had to bring in a family artifact to share something that made you uniquely you? I remember sharing my grandfather's flag as a World War II veteran. I shared with the group that the greatest lesson he taught me was that a real man fights with his words, using his hands as last resort. My talk was about values — valuing service and valuing yourself enough to not let others bully you in life or compromising your own success by getting into a fistfight.

There's a lot to be learned through storytelling. In fact, it's the only way wisdom has been passed down through generations. Consider how wise you want your employees and company culture to be and implement simple storytelling avenues to bring people together through shared values. Think of a unique opportunity to share something that is deeply personal and 100% diverse from the group.

Remember that diversity and inclusion is truly about the depth of who we are, what we think and where we all need to go as a company or nation to ensure a just and equal society where everyone feels supported to thrive.",
"If anyone had any lasting doubts about influencer marketing, Facebook’s sudden attention to the market may erase them.

This June, Facebook launched their own influencer marketing tool entitled Brand Collabs Manager (subscription required). Shortly after, it was reported that Facebook played a major role in influencer marketing company Deep Social’s decision to shut down after the platform revoked its authorization to use Facebook-owned data.

Although perhaps more aggressive, Facebook is not the only major social network to enter the influencer space. Take, for example, Pinterest’s Pin Collective or Google’s acquisition of FameBit in 2016.

As in the case of Deep Social, this trend could hurt a thriving industry: third-party influencer marketing companies. Platform-owned influencer tools could be seen as an alternate, superior solution to marketing agencies that lack access to the same proprietary data. (Full disclosure: Upfluence offers influencer marketing software and services.)

All hope is not lost, though. Influencer marketing is a booming, lucrative market with thousands of players.

Here’s what smaller influencer marketing companies can do to stay competitive:

• Specialize in your offer. Many companies in the influencer space can differentiate themselves from competitors by offering a niche service, such as outdoors, business-to-business or microinfluencer marketing. The idea is that by focusing on a specific group, you can provide a more targeted strategy than bigger platforms.

• Develop different business models. Directories, marketplaces, search engine tools, creative agencies, software-as-a-service (SaaS) -- the list goes on! The reality is that Fortune 500 brands, public relations firms, small businesses and individual marketers may all want to work with influencers, but not on the same scale. Expand the number of solutions you offer to ensure every actor gets exactly what matches their needs.

• Become a multiplatform agency. Marketing and advertising agencies can do something that platforms can’t: advertise their influencer services for multiple social networks. This gives you a significant edge in an environment in which most influencers are “multiplatform” and some niches, such as esports, are native to specific networks.

• Cover the campaign from start to finish. It’s doubtful that social networks will want to take on the responsibility of micromanaging campaigns that often require extensive monitoring and hands-on support. As an agency, however, you are able to deliver end-to-end accompaniment for the entire influencer process -- from influencer identification and publication review all the way to the payout.

• Focus on relationships. In a recent article by PRWeek (subscription required), influencer marketing was described to be “held back by short-termism and a lack of collaboration.” Surmount this mentality (and the poor content that comes with it) by matching brands with a tailored selection of influencers. The amount of time and effort that goes into hand-picking these collaborators is a distinctive service that sets agencies apart from static tools.

• Provide additional services. Influencer marketing companies are innovating many areas of digital marketing, from social listening to artificial intelligence. By providing additional services, such as results tracking, content marketing or influencer recommendations, you can help your company stand out from the crowd.

• Focus on data, data, data. Independently aggregating analytics and publicly available data is the safest way to go. It might require a little more heavy lifting on your company’s end, but it’s a lot more reliable than counting on someone else to build your database.

Are influencers really worth fighting for?

As discussed in a previous article, social networks seem to show an increased dependency on influencers, who produce valuable content that drives user engagement and retention. If this is the case, it’s no wonder why social networks are becoming more invested in supporting their influencers.

Contrary to what one might think, Facebook’s influencer marketing initiative could have a positive outcome for companies that specialize in the strategy. The more networks that get involved, the more mainstream the strategy becomes.

As more brands want to work with influencers, there will be a greater need for professionals to help manage campaigns. Small companies can adapt (and thrive) when supplementing the gaps between social platform, influencer and brand.",
"“It takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it,” said Warren Buffett, the legendary investor and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway.

The fragility of an organisation’s good name was starkly illustrated this week, as thousands of Google employees in 50 cities around the world staged walkouts in protest at the company’s treatment of women, just days after the search engine group was named the company with the best reputation among millennials by the Reputation Institute.

It was the only company in the ranking to gain an “excellent” score, with the institute saying: “The tech giant displays great consistency with a top 3 ranking among both Millennials and the global public overall, while also coming in poll position in the latest RI CSR ranking.”

Luxury brand Rolex was in second place, with a strong performance on Products, Leadership and Financial Performance while Walt Disney was placed third, scoring highly in Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) as well as in Leadership, and Performance – dimensions which are all disproportionally important to Millennials.

Stephen Hahn-Griffiths, chief reputation officer at the institute, said: “Rolex’s connection with high-profile sports icons such as Roger Federer has paid dividends and elevated its reputation among a young audience. The embodiment of “success with integrity” makes Rolex an aspirational brand and enables it to forge a strong emotional bond with Millennials. Disney came second only to Google in the ranking for corporate responsibility and has done a superb job communicating their work around green energy and workers pay in a relevant way, with sufficient depth and sincerity.”

The Reputation Institute’s 2018 Millennial RepTrak® report, based on more than 230,000 individual ratings from among the informed general public across the globe, with 145 multi-national companies assessed in January and February 2018.

There are 1.8 billion millennials globally, the institute says, and by 2020, they will comprise 35% of the global workforce, according to Manpower, while Deloitte reports that they will have a net worth of $24 trillion. The top 10 brands are spread fairly evenly across the globe, with three in the US (Google, Walt Disney, Microsoft) and Japan (Nintendo, Sony, Canon) and four from Europe (Rolex, Lego, BMW, Adidas).

The survey suggests that Google’s reputation, among millennials at least, may be safe for now, with products and services the most important single driver of corporate reputation according to the latest figures. They are slightly less concerned about issues of governance and citizenship than non-millennials, but more focused on corporate financial performance.

On the other hand, they still place huge importance (30%) on areas of corporate responsibility, while thinking that companies perform worst in this area, suggesting that companies that can improve their CSR performance and communicate this to millennial consumers have a real opportunity to boost their reputation and sales.

This group of consumers puts a lot of store in strong corporate leadership, the survey found, with a company’s reputation enhanced if the CEO was familiar to those questioned.

“CEO responsibility is a leading quality for most millennials, highlighting their importance as the face of the company. To improve their reputation among millennials, CEOs need to focus on conveying a sense of social responsibility and ethical behaviour,” Hahn-Griffiths added: “The highest dimension lift among those familiar with CEOs are in the key dimensions of citizenship and governance - Google’s Sundar Pichai is a prime example of a CEO who has got this right and Google are clearly reaping the rewards as a result.

“Perhaps the biggest opportunity for business today is improving corporate responsibility, which is gaining momentum all the time,” he continued. “Companies need to be progressive and show they care, otherwise they risk being left behind. When we consider that millennials are set to comprise 35% of the global workforce by 2020, this is a reputational risk few companies can afford to take.”

The top 10 companies among millennials worldwide in 2018 are:",
"Who you are as a leader and how you lead is defined by your relationship to others and begins with your relationship with yourself. Why you lead and how you lead relate directly to your inner motivators and cultural context (the values, beliefs and practices you were raised with). Those motivators impact the relationships you have with your team members and yourself.

Each of us is motivated by leanings toward independence (perceiving the world through the lens of “I”) and interdependence (perceiving the world through the lens of “we”). Social science research links our leanings in part to our cultural context, with western European and North American cultures more independent and Asian and Latin American cultures more interdependent. Many of those leanings play out at an unconscious level, and being a leader adds another layer of complexity to the dance between the two.

Understanding how your desires for independence and interdependence play out in your leadership abilities is an essential starting point for learning to focus on and foster the skills that will allow you to lead the dance between the two, expanding your leadership potential.

The stronger your orientation toward independence, the more comfortable you are with the isolation of your role. Drawing boundaries between you and your direct reports comes naturally. Independence allows you to make decisions and respond to situations with timeliness and efficiency. When work is not done to your satisfaction, you step in and do it yourself. You are risk-averse, desiring to always be in control.

The greater your desire to build your team, foster relationships and empower individuals, the further your leadership leans toward interdependence. As an interdependent leader, you are comfortable committing the time needed for providing ongoing feedback that fosters individual learning and growth. You thrive on risk-taking and use failure as an opportunity to learn and grow.

The Cautions At Each End Of The Spectrum

While there is a sense of control and tidiness in independent leadership, isolating yourself from your team limits your ability to understand their needs and foster their individual and team potential. Independent leadership leads to a sense of control, speed and efficiency. Yet, the stronger your need to control, the greater your need to micromanage. Micromanaging robs your direct reports of learning, devalues their sense of worth and fosters resentment, which can lead to mediocrity and higher staff turnover.

As an interdependent leader, you can get so involved in understanding and fostering individuals that it becomes difficult for you and your team members to see the line between friendship and leadership. Successful interdependent leadership requires the ability to demonstrate to your stakeholders that the time needed to teach and empower your team pays off in increased productivity, creativity and staff retention.

Expanding your leadership potential requires you to learn to dance between the two ends of the independence-interdependence spectrum, from an “I” mindset to a “we” mindset. Allow yourself the flexibility to shift and foster your leadership potential. Visualize your leadership as a dance by asking yourself questions like:

• How can I invite others to join in?

• How can I support them in learning the “dance” (the knowledge, skills and attitudes)?

• How can I invite and allow others to take the lead?

• How can I learn the steps of others to adapt the dance, allowing it to evolve into something new and unique?

Leading from the independent end of the spectrum by pulling back from your team and allowing them to own their roles and their failures is necessary once you have invested the interdependence time in building respectful relationships that have fostered their learning and aptitudes. The dance continues with each new employee and every new organizational demand.",
"Kara hurried out of her office and slammed the car door in frustration as she sped out of the parking lot. Her boss gave her a bunch of papers to be signed by a new vendor they were using for a customer relations software package. As usual, when leaving the corporate office, Kara felt stressed, tense and about ready to come out of her skin. At first, she had been excited being hired by a successful company and figured going to work in their sleek new office building would be great. After three months, however, she felt like snapping at everyone in sight. Today was no exception as she gave her opinion aloud of all the drivers in her way who seemed to have no business on the road.

Pulling up to the software company, she looked in surprise at the huge building. When the receptionist escorted her to see the CEO, she entered a comfortably furnished room that looked more like someone’s living room. A woman about Kara’s age, Marcy, came from behind a table and greeted her warmly.

Kara nodded and introduced herself. Marcy indicated a seat at a sofa with some mugs, a hot carafe of water and a rosewood box holding a selection of teas. “Have a cup of tea,” said Marcy. “Let’s chat and then we can do the paperwork.”

In 10 minutes, Kara felt more happy and comfortable in this work situation than she had at her own in the past few months. Finally, she blurted out: “Marcy, I can’t tell you how nice it is here. I can’t explain it, but after being in an office that looks so sterile with everything focused on work, your place is like an oasis.” Putting her cup down, Kara asked, “There’s something here that is so unique for me. What did you do?”

Marcy smiled happily. ""It's called 'hygge.' I spent a year of college in Denmark, and the term comes from them. It means making things cozy and comfortable. When I saw how well it worked for my home and family, I made a conscious effort to do it to my business when it began to take off. My employees enjoy coming to work because of the atmosphere I created. I am a believer that happy employees make for great employees, and hygge is a component of that!”

Pronounced “hoo-geh,” the Danish word indeed loosely translates to “cozy.” The concept for the Danish people began somewhere in the 1800s and became a lifestyle goal for much of the country.

Picture yourself on a snowy day settling down with a cup of hot chocolate or your favorite beverage watching a good movie with friends or loved ones. It’s a warm and cozy feeling thinking about it. That’s hygge. The word comes from a Norwegian word for “well-being.” As a trend, it caught on in the United Kingdom with books published on the subject in the past five years. Now, it has spread to the United States.

What Does It Mean For Business?

Many companies, big and small, do not spend a lot of time figuring out how to make the workplace an enjoyable place for its people. In fact, some go so far the other way that their offices or work locations are devoid of any items besides necessities. There are no personal pictures or decorations, there's a strict dress code and the ambiance resembles that of an operating room. The general reason for this is to “reduce distractions.”

In reality, people are the most valuable resource any company has. Ever notice some of the most successful companies also consistently rank on the lists of best places to work? There is a correlation. When you have happy employees, they stick around. You have an experienced staff who knows what they are doing and are used to working with everyone around them. It becomes the perfect storm of establishing a great workplace culture.

Aside from the physical aspects of promoting coziness, a great deal of hygge in the workplace is the policies you implement for the employees. Let’s take a look at a few ideas that are easy to adopt that cost the company nothing.

• Encourage your workers to take their breaks outside. Nothing clears the mind and improves the mood more than physically getting out of the office for coffee or to have lunch.

• Let your employees listen to music. Depending on how many people you have working and the limits of the office, they might have to wear earphones or keep the music low, but many reports indicate that music adds to the job satisfaction for a worker. In the same way, wearing comfortable clothing at work has a huge positive effect.

• Give employees an opportunity to decorate their desk or work area. Your employees are going to spend at least a third of their day at work. What is so terrible about letting them enjoy where they have to spend that time? Absolutely nothing at all! The lines between work and personal life should be less blurry.

There is more reason than ever before to create a work environment that will promote a positive attitude when your employees are present. For that matter, this applies to business owners and management as well. The simple concept of hygge can introduce everything positive you want in your business and workplace.",
"You don’t even have to tell me. I already know the way your eyes light up when you see a position you know would be perfect for you. I know how anxious you get when you finally send the application you’re hoping gets you through the door.

And, I know how frustrated you feel when you check your email 103 times only to later discover that the company decided to go with another candidate.

“But why?” That’s the question that roams your mind.

“Why does this keep happening?”

The problem isn’t that you’re not good enough, you’re just doing a couple of things wrong:

You’re Still Focused on What You Used to Do

Your resume still focuses on your current position and it doesn’t highlight what you’re looking to do next in your career.

For instance, if you’re ready to finally secure your first management position, but your resume only talks about the projects you’ve worked on and doesn’t mention one word about your leadership skills, and your ability to manage or develop a team, you’re doing yourself a disservice.

If you’re a PR professional working at an oil and gas company, and you’re trying to snag a communications position at a tech company, you’re holding yourself back if your resume is ridden with oil and gas jargon.

Instead, start focusing on how your experience and accomplishments align with the role you want next, and use keywords that clearly indicate the value you’ll bring to the next organization.

If you’re still submitting your applications through online portals, you’re subjecting yourself to The Black Hole of Rejection, as I like to call it. Solely applying to positions online is a sure way to limit yourself, and to get overlooked. Why put yourself through the pain when you can connect with real humans?

Instead, reach out to hiring managers directly through email. Connect with mutual friends who have contacts at the companies you’ve been eyeing. Get out of your comfort zone and reach out to strangers who work at companies you love. The best way to stand out from the pack of applicants is to get out of the pack and get ahead.

You’re Applying to Companies You Don’t Truly Love

If you’re still applying to 20 positions a week, I’m giving you serious side-eye right now. It’s impossible to find 20 companies you love in one week, every week. I get it. You're desperate to take your career to the next level as soon as possible, but your desperation shows. It’s trailing right behind every job application.

Slow down and do your research. Discover if you truly do love each company and why you love the company before you apply for the position. When you fall in love with the company, your resume, and everything else will radiate your love and admiration, and you’ll have hiring managers wanting to speak with you because you understand their needs.

You Don’t Know What Makes You Great

Do you truly know what you bring to the table? Do you know what makes you an asset and why you’re the obvious best choice for the position you want? If you can’t answer those questions, then you’re most likely not communicating that in your resume or anywhere else.

Rather than having the “Pick me! Pick me!” mindset, consider the strengths that make you a perfect match for each position you desire. Then, determine which accomplishments perfectly demonstrate the value you bring to the company. Once you know what makes you great, you’ll have no trouble articulating that, and no trouble getting interviews.

Getting interviews, and ultimately landing the position you want, is about knowing your value, getting in front of the right people, and knowing how to communicate the key elements about you that make you an asset to the role and companies you’re chasing.",
"Organizers of the annual Davos conference ranked the United States first in their ranking of the world's most competitive economies for the first time in a decade Wednesday, saying the number one spot reflects a new methodology and long-term factors more than recent policies of the Trump administration.

The World Economic Forum said its ""Global Competitiveness Report"" is based on nearly 100 separate factors in a dozen categories that have been reworked slightly to better reflect today's rapidly changing, increasingly digitized world economy.

The U.S. is followed by Singapore, Germany, Switzerland and Japan in the top five spots among the 140 economies considered. In nearly 40 years of the group's rankings on competitiveness, the U.S. previously earned top honors in 2008. Switzerland was No. 1 last year.

Nearly all of the top 30 performers are developed economies in Asia and Europe, along with Israel at 20, the United Arab Emirates at 27, China at 28 and Qatar at 30. Many African countries again lagged, and they have shown few signs of significant improvement, forum analysts said.

The authors tweaked the index this year to account in part for the effects of the 2008 financial crisis, changes in human capital and the ""Fourth Industrial Revolution"" -- the forum's buzzword for the digital revolution that is disrupting nearly every industry around the globe at a breakneck pace.

The main takeaway of this revised edition is that no single factor makes a country stand out, and each nation should find its route to developing and improving, the authors said.

""If anything, this report is saying there are no silver bullets,"" Saadia Zahidi, the forum's managing director in charge of economic and social agenda, said in an interview. ""We used to say: 'You have to compete on the basis of your low-skilled labor. You need to industrialize first then you need to bring in other aspects of growth and competitiveness.' That model no longer exists, not in a world where you have cheaper capital and cheaper technology than ever before.""

Zahidi said that though the United States scored 85.6 out of 100, there was still room for improvement, and pointed to some ""worrying signs."" While the U.S. fared well in areas for business dynamism, financial system and innovation, it did less well on areas such as security -- like its high homicide rate for a developed country.

""It's a country that is doing extremely well in terms of its labor market dynamism overall, but workers' rights remain low,"" Zahidi said. ""Active labor market policies are also somewhat missing as compared to other advanced economies.""

She said some business sentiment expressed in surveys of executives might relate to Trump administration policies like its tax cuts. But she said, ""The questions that we're asking them are really about the long-term fundamentals of competitiveness. So I would say this is really about that longer term, and a little bit less about some of the short-term measures.""

The report makes a pitch for the importance of ""openness"" at a time of rising trade tensions and increasing protectionist or isolationist impulses in some parts of the globe -- notably the West. It insists that social safety nets and investments in ""human capital"" do not necessarily come at the expense of economic growth.

The rankings, with 98 separate data points, offered bright spots as well as points of improvement for nearly every country: Germany was number one in innovation, for example. China, which ranked No. 1 in terms of ""market size"" based on per-capita purchasing power parity, tallied poor marks in some areas -- notably ranking a dead last 140th in ""freedom of the press.""",
"Brands are missing out on reaching valuable new audiences by shying away from sponsoring women’s sports.

That is according to Sam Grimley, commercial director at GumGum, a “computer vision” company that tracks the value of sports sponsorships based on online and broadcast exposure.

In the level of investment and coverage, female sports remain well behind male sports. One estimate found that between 2011 and 2013, women’s sports sponsorships accounted for just 0.4% of all sports sponsorships.

Grimley believes there are opportunities for smaller and emerging brands to sponsor women’s sports and make meaningful connections with consumers.

“For one, you have that lower price point. So you have brands who maybe would never be able to dream of getting in to sponsor a men's Premier League football team, but they may have the right budget to be able to sponsor the front of the shirt of the women's team of that Premier League football club,” Grimley told me in an interview.

“You open up a whole new pyramid of brands. … I know what the entry level is for certain Premier League clubs, and it can be seven digits to even have a conversation. So that obviously rules out a lot of brands very, very quickly. If the women's team is asking for low six figures, it means you've got this much bigger audience of brands you can reach with the money and also you've got brands who may not want to target a certain demographic.

“There might be a cosmetic brand who would never dream of sponsoring a men’s rugby union team because it's not really an audience they want to get to. But there are opportunities in women's sport where they can reach their audience and start to have conversations.”

This year, for the first time since 2010, no women made Forbes’ list of the world’s 100 highest-paid athletes.

But as more viewers are drawn to women’s sports, a growing number of sponsors are stepping up.

Research from Sports Marketing Agency Two Circles found attendances for women’s sports in the UK had grown 38% year-on-year since 2013. This year, for the first time, the number of fans attending elite women’s sporting events in the UK was set to hit 682,000, a 49% increase from 2017.

The audience for the soccer European Championships 2017 semifinal was watched by more than four million in the UK, and nearly two million watched the Women’s Rugby World Cup final last year.

Broadcaster Sky reported a peak audience of 1.1 million for the Women’s World Cup cricket final, won by England — more than men’s Premier League matches draw on average.

Tammy Parlour, co-founder and joint CEO of UK charity Women’s Sport Trust, told Reuters that consistent audience growth would help lure sponsors.

“Big live crowds and viewing figures feed the interest of both the media and sponsors,” she said.

The biggest brands with the biggest budgets are still likely to back the most recognizable global sporting stars and teams. With some notable exceptions — Serena Williams, for example — these still tend to be men.

However, sports sponsorship is about more than just boosting brand awareness, according to Grimley.

“It’s about reaching new audiences,” he says. “If I look at my nieces, they love watching women's cricket. They don't watch men's cricket; their stars are the players in the England women's team.

“For the brand that wants to get to my 15-year-old niece, and wants to have affinity with her and her passion point, they'd be wasting their money sponsoring the men's cricket team. But doing something with the women's team, you can reach her.”

Grimley argues that the days when sponsors relied on their team being broadcast on television are over. GumGum uses an artificial intelligence tool to measure what it says is the true value of sponsorship across channels including traditional broadcast, streaming and social media.

“There are all these new technologies and the rise of social, allowing sports to be seen by a completely different audience,” Grimley says.

Brands that may not have a traditional synergy with sport or athletes are also seeing opportunities to increase engagement and promote values through women’s sport.

Arkema, a French chemicals and advanced materials giant, has signed up as a national sponsor for the women’s soccer World Cup next year, one of the biggest team events in the women’s sports calendar.

Explaining the decision, Thierry Le Hénaff, Arkema's chairman and CEO, said it was “a great opportunity for us to support and enhance the status of women both in sport and at work.”

Sports sponsorship carries the risk of a potential negative association with the sponsor’s brand, whether stemming from a team on a losing run or an athlete’s inappropriate social media post.

“If the athlete doesn't have as much coverage, if there was a scandal, it's not as likely to make the front page of the newspaper. But at the same time, if they do something amazing, it's still not as likely to make the front page of the newspaper,” Grimley says.

“It's risk and reward — the brands that put their neck out now (to sponsor women’s sports) will probably get a great deal.”",
"The shock value of the recent prediction by research group IDC that the world will be creating 163 zettabytes of data a year by 2025 depends on three things.

Firstly, who knows what a zettabyte is (one trillion gigabytes)? Secondly, what is the current annual data creation rate (16.3ZB)? And thirdly do these figures mean anything in a world where we take for granted that data will expand exponentially forever and mostly accept the future reality of autonomous cars and intelligent personal assistants, yet have little real idea of how they will change our lives?

IDC’s paper, Data Age 2025, perhaps answers only the first two questions. Forecasting a ten-fold increase in worldwide data by 2025, it envisions an era focused on creating, utilizing, and managing “life critical” data necessary for the smooth running of daily life.

Consumers will create, share and access data on a completely device-neutral basis. The cloud will grow well beyond previous expectations and corporate leaders will have unparalleled opportunities to leverage new business opportunities, it predicts. But firms will also need to make strategic choices on data collection, utilization and location.

I recently interviewed Jeff Fochtman, vice-president of marketing Seagate Technology, the $14BN market capitalization data storage group that sponsored the IDC report.

""For individuals and businesses, a data deluge can cause problems in just being able to manage, store and access that data,"" he says.

""But the thing that jumps out at me is the critical problems that data is going to solve. On an increasingly populated planet, data is going to solve the things impacting on the human experience: traffic, how we move around, how we grow food and how we feed the population globally.

""More than ever, data is going to be critical to humanity.""

IDC says that in a shift from the current situation, 60% of the world’s data will be created and managed by businesses in 2025, with this trend driven by the evolution of data from business to life-critical applications, the rise of embedded systems and the Internet of Things, the growth of machine learning and the advent of true mobile and real-time data.

It predicts that by 2025 nearly 20% of the data in the global datasphere will be critical to our daily lives.

In eight years' time, an average connected person anywhere in the world will interact with connected devices nearly 4,800 times per day – one interaction every 18 seconds.

Meanwhile, the amount of the global datasphere that’s subject to data analysis will grow by a factor of 50 and more than a quarter of all data created will be real-time.

Data creation, it says, will shift its drive from entertainment content to productivity-driven and embedded data, as well as non-entertainment images and video such as surveillance and advertising.

What To Use And What To Store

That doesn't mean that all this data has to be kept, of course. In fact, IDC reckons that only 19ZB of the total amount of data that will be generated between now and 2025 will actually be stored.

""We store less than 1pc of the data we create,"" says Fochtman, ""and that number will continue to decline.

""The percentage of the data created that is stored is going down because firstly it's impossible to keep up with the rate of it and secondly it's not all necessary

""The amount of storage shipped cannot keep up with the amount of data created. The tipping point of that is the Internet of Things.

""There will just be so many sensor points and so much data that doesn't need to be stored.""

Seagate claims to have more of the world's information stored on its products than any other company.

However, Fochtman sees plenty of difficult choices ahead. ""How do we manage that much data?"" he asks.

""We could break ground and build more factories to ship more storage but there's an inflexion point there on the cost and how to manage that much storage.

""What is the right amount of storage to ship. It's not really about catching up with data created. It's about what is the right amount of data to store and how to extract the business value, the value for human experience and the personal value. That's the choice and it's a definitive challenge.""",
"Recent research shows that girls start getting the message that they're less than equal when they're children. So kudos to actress and mom Kristen Bell for calling out one of the most insidious sources for this kind of messaging--children's fairy tales. Bell, best known as the voice of Anna in Frozen and as the star of the TV miniseries Veronica Mars, loves to snuggle up and read bedtime stories to her daughters, five-year-old Lincoln and three-year-old Delta.

But when she's done, she doesn't just tuck them in and turn out the light. She has a brief discussion with the kids about the lessons, good or bad, you can learn from a fairy tale. Take ""Snow White,"" a Grimm brothers tale that has, of course, become a beloved Disney classic, and which Bell targeted in a recent interview with Parents magazine. In the story, Snow White is a princess who has been keeping house for seven male dwarfs while hiding from her wicked stepmother who envies her beauty and intends to do her harm. But when the stepmother shows up disguised as a hag and offers Snow White a poisoned apple, she eats it and falls into a death-like sleep. She's saved when a handsome prince comes along and kisses her, the only thing that can bring her back to life.

There's a whole lot that's wrong with this story, so every time they read it, Bell dissects it for her daughters. ""I look at my girls and ask, 'Don't you think it's weird that Snow White didn't ask the old witch why she needed to eat the apple? Or where she got that apple?' I say, 'I would never take food from a stranger, would you?'"" When her daughters answer ""No!"" Bell figures she's doing something right. She also asks Lincoln and Delta if they think it's weird that the prince kisses Snow White while she's asleep and without asking her permission first--another no-no. Does she also question the fact that Snow White's entire worth seems to come from her beauty and housekeeping skills? Bell doesn't say, but that might be a good next step.

Bell is not the only movie star to put some thought into the messages her daughters might be getting from classic fairy tales and popular culture. Keira Knightley, known for her role in Pirates of the Caribbean and currently starring in Colette, told Ellen Degeneres that the Disney movies Cinderella and The Little Mermaid are banned from viewing by her three-year-old daughter because they don't reflect female empowerment. In Cinderella, Knightley said, ""She waits around for a rich guy to rescue her. Don't! Rescue yourself, obviously."" Not to mention the fact that her entire future rests on having smaller feet than anyone else.

The Little Mermaid is forbidden--even though Knightley likes the music--because Ariel gives up her voice to the villain Ursula for a chance to meet the prince she's fallen in love with from afar. ""I mean, the songs are great but do not give your voice up for a man. Hello?!"" Knightley said. The original Hans Christian Andersen story is even worse. In it, the mermaid not only gives up her voice but has to endure horrific pain whenever she walks or dances on her human legs, which she does a lot. And when she fails in her quest to prevent her beloved prince from marrying someone else, she dies.

Is it better to talk to your daughters about how fairy tales and the movies made from them portray women, or better to ban them outright? There are arguments both ways, but I'm in favor of discussion because parents can't always control what content their kids are exposed to when they visit friends or even at school. And once you start paying attention to the messages classic children's stories and classic movies deliver about women's place in the world, it's hard not to start seeing those messages everywhere--in sitcoms and children's books, and cartoons, and on and on. Getting your daughters to see those messages to might be the best first step toward protecting them.",
"Every year Fairygodboss puts together an event called Galvanize, which centers around ways for women to shatter the glass ceiling and overcome workplace barriers. This year, Galvanize featured a plethora of well-established and renowned speakers from a number of different companies, including Carla Harris, the vice chairman of Wealth Management for Morgan Stanley. Former President Barack Obama appointed Harris to chair the National Women’s Business Council. At Galvanize 2018, Harris discussed her trajectory and how she has been able to reach the pinnacles of success she has reached throughout her career. When Harris was asked what the keys to her success are and how women can shatter the glass ceiling, she highlighted one critical tool in a woman’s toolbox for workplace success: Sponsorships. What steps can women take to get sponsorship in their organization?

1. Get an accurate definition. Often times, in the conversation regarding female advancement, mentorship is a topic that is frequently brought up, and used synonymously with sponsorship, but the two are very distinct. A mentor will give you guidance and career advice, whereas a sponsor will advocate for you and will actively help you with your career advancement. Women tend to derive greater benefit from having a sponsor versus a mentor. The Center for Talent Innovation (CTI) found that 85% of women need guidance and support in order to advance in their careers but receive guidance and support far less than their White male counterparts.

2. Find prospective sponsors. Assess who could potentially serve as your sponsor within your organization, or outside of your organization. You want to focus on multiple people that can serve as your sponsors. The CTI indicates that one important question to ask when seeking sponsors is “which senior leaders could benefit from my career advancement?” Once you have established who that individual or individuals are, then you have to be intentional about building a relationship with them.

3. Assess the sponsor’s value. One of the main reasons why women have an inability to find sponsors within their organization is that they focus on others who they like and admire, perhaps those they see as a role model, versus choosing individuals within the organization that are important power players and have the ability to impact their career and take it to new heights. When assessing the perceived value of your sponsor(s), the CTI suggests asking yourself, “which senior leader has a network and platform most equipped to help me advance in my career?” Sylvia Ann Hewlett, author of the book Forget a Mentor, Find a Sponsor, indicates that when searching for a sponsor you must remember that “you’re looking not for a friend but an ally.”

4. Bring something to the table. Establish a reputation as an individual that works hard and gets things done, to make yourself more viable for potential sponsors. Having a sponsor shouldn’t be a one-sided relationship that benefits only the individual being sponsored. Once you gain a sponsor, you have to perform well and excel at what you’re doing. Sponsorship can actually be very beneficial to the sponsor(s) as well. By helping to propel an individual to higher levels in their career, a sponsor’s career can be elevated and sponsors reported feelings of satisfaction.

It’s critical for organizations to create an environment where sponsorships can develop and thrive. Several companies have already created formal sponsorship programs including AT&T, Deloitte, American Express, and Morgan Stanley. Sponsorships are beneficial for both the sponsor and the individual being sponsored, but sponsorships also have a positive impact on the organization, increasing employee engagement, retention, talent development and improving the talent pipeline. It is in a company’s best interest to create opportunities for sponsorship.",
"Influencer marketing is a force to be reckoned with, and the industry is showing no signs of slowing down. We’ve all seen the data that supports this powerful form of marketing and the studies that show how today’s consumers are much more influenced by their peers than traditional advertisements. In fact, according to Nielsen's Global Trust in Advertising report, 82% of those in the U.S. trust recommendations from people they know.

We know it works -- but do we know why? How is it that people have come to rely on the word of virtual strangers in their social media communities in order to make buying decisions, and how can we leverage this information to improve our influencer campaigns? A recent study revealed that just 5% of all branded content gets 90% of engagements, so what is the trick for creating content that resonates?

In my role as CEO of an influencer marketing agency, I can tell you that it all comes down to two words: human connection.

Influencers build connections with their audiences, and in turn, audiences come to respect and trust their opinions and recommendations. These connections happen in a variety of ways, all of which contribute to a thriving environment of marketing opportunities.

Don’t Be Afraid To Get Personal

Over time, influencers become familiar to their audiences, whether or not they’ve met in person or even interacted online. They’re often seen every day via social channels, and some share deeply personal content along with intimate glimpses into their lives. These feelings of familiarity and attachment can build meaningful experiences for audiences, which can foster a successful environment for influencers to organically share brand content in their own voice.

Don’t limit your campaigns to supplied brand imagery and impersonal messages. Audiences will be far more interested in real-life, genuine stories and images that come from the heart. In fact, this type of authentic content (as opposed to stock-image perfection) can often be a key factor when consumers choose brands, according to a recent Stackla report. With the correct licensing rights, influencer-created images or a similar style of photography can be used on your owned social channels or in your digital advertising efforts to create a personal connection with consumers.

An influencer who feels like a friend is treated as such, with audiences responding with support and feedback during their life events. When audiences are emotionally invested in an influencer, they tend to be more engaged and view the influencer with admiration. The influencer’s recommendations don’t feel like advertisements but like valuable information shared by a trusted friend.

Your campaigns should feel like a seamless evolution of the influencer’s narrative, rather than a sudden interruption in tone and language. Let influencers craft the compelling stories they’re so good at and encourage conversation and questions. The positive associations will happen on their own.

Tap Into The Power Of Aspirational Influencers

Aspirational influencers -- those with attractively styled, heavily curated content (think fashion bloggers or lifestyle mavens) -- continue to have a place next to the more candid, “real life” accounts. These are the creators who often stir feelings of respect and appreciation.

Scientifically, creative admiration goes beyond fandom. When we study the crafts and techniques of perceived masters of a given art, we see our own potential. Audiences are drawn to an influencer's style, home decor, beauty, parenting skills, hosting ability and so on -- and they’re extremely eager to learn about the products and services that may help them achieve similar results.

To tap into this, include useful, real-life tips and advice in your sponsored posts and marketing efforts, from photo tutorials to printables to recipe videos.

The notion of the ambient awareness brought on by social networks and photo-sharing platforms is that each individual update may be insignificant or mundane, but when experienced as a whole over time, these tiny glimpses give us a feeling of digital connection with the lives around us. A single instance of seeing an influencer’s morning coffee cup may not be impactful, but ongoing online awareness can expand social ties and feelings of participation and connection.

This means that large-scale campaigns can become even more valuable over time, as audiences encounter your brand message in a variety of spaces. A branded Twitter conversation coupled with Twitter advertising is another way to boost those small exposures that build stronger engagement.

Today, the true “full access” platform is Instagram’s Stories feature, where creators can share quick images and videos that vanish after 24 hours. The informal, temporary nature of this platform is fueling a new trend reminiscent of the confessional blog posts that were popular a decade ago. Influencers are sharing personal, off-the-cuff content that is often quite different from their regular Instagram feeds.

While influencer campaigns are just starting to embrace Stories, my opinion is that this is the space to keep an eye on. With the recent additions of polls and questions, influencers are also able to create interesting two-way dialogues with their audiences -- it’s the perfect place for informal, positive brand conversations.

Emotions have always played a role in consumers’ purchase decisions, and today’s digital influencers are the ideal launchpad for brands looking to form authentic bonds with audiences. Influencers already have the trust, relatability and positive associations. With the right partnerships and campaigns, influencers can express brand messages in ways that far surpass sales pitches. Instead, these brand stories become long-lasting, authentic human connections.",
"Seventy-two percent of sales leaders surveyed believe their sales reps are unable to properly connect solutions to business challenges. As a result, 70% of companies surveyed have a sales force in which nearly three-quarters of sales professionals fail to meet their quotas.

These findings from SiriusDecisions' 2018 Global Chief Sales Officer Study (download required) represent the challenging state of selling today.

In response to this challenge, some have turned to technology. From my perspective as a chief sales officer, however, more technology has done little to help. In fact, 2016 research from Accenture found that 59% of sales professionals believe that they have ""too many sales tools.” These findings suggest that the future is uncertain for selling organizations, but why? Sales professionals often have endless resources and multiple lead sources. I believe the answer is that selling has become more complex because the customer’s world has become more complex. As a result, the customer has changed, but few sellers have changed with them.

Here, we'll look at three of the key factors that I've seen change the customer’s world. By understanding these new circumstances, sales leaders can position themselves for success in the future.

Advances in technology have introduced more automation into the selling process and have increased the sophistication of products. These factors can leave sales professionals engaging in complex, “high-touch” sales cycles more frequently. This shift has left traditional selling skills behind in exchange for a more progressive set of skills and competencies.

To modernize, sales professionals must recognize that customer needs have evolved. Keeping pace with this evolution requires more than product knowledge. It requires positioning. Getting the positioning right can mean getting the selling behaviors right. These behaviors usually emerge during the “moments of truth” in the sale: the moments in front of your customer. In these moments, sales professionals should avoid counterproductive behaviors like reciting a list of product capabilities, reliance on intuition or seller-centric communication.

Instead, they can adhere to two key concepts. First, they can leverage insights gained through questioning. With a careful questioning strategy, a sales professional can isolate customers' needs. Then, they should connect them to solutions.

Second, they can adopt a mindset of authenticity. With this style, sales professionals are less transactional. Instead, they work alongside the customer to properly diagnose the problem or measure the challenge.

Commoditization is the very reason this consultative approach can be so effective. Buyers leverage technology to access quick answers and fast solutions. Skilled sale professionals can stand out in this environment because they go beyond selling and become trusted advisors.

It’s no surprise that one company McKinsey surveyed experienced “$500 million in new bookings and a 40 percent improvement in productivity,” after transitioning from transactional to consultative selling and other modern tactics.

Real momentum in selling is more than asking the customer to commit to the next step. Real momentum occurs when the customer, not the sales professional, requests the next step. In my experience, a buyer’s genuine interest and momentum far outweighs any artificial momentum a seller can create.

To achieve this kind of momentum, sales professionals can deliver a truly insightful conversation using a four-step model: assess, strategize, prepare and engage. Let’s look at what each of these steps means.

• Assess: Sales professionals should take full stock of their strengths, vulnerabilities and gaps in their understanding of the customer’s position. Sales professionals can also assess the viability of the opportunity, the stakeholders and the competitive positioning.

• Strategize: The solution’s value should align with the customer’s specific needs. Strategizing means developing an action plan to create this alignment. Here, sales professionals organize what they know into a map that accounts for the customer’s goals and the solution’s value message.

• Prepare: Complex sales often require numerous sales professionals. Therefore, teams should decide on each sales professional’s role. Preparation also means knowing what evidence each sales professional will use to support their position.

• Engage: Engaging means executing the strategy while adjusting as needed in the moment. The ""engage"" step also asks the sales professional to gauge the customer’s level of engagement. Short responses from the customer often indicate low engagement. Long answers can indicate high engagement.

The buyer’s psychology is more complex.

I've found that the buyer’s psychology factors into the sale more than ever. The reason: Customers have access to enormous amounts of information. This flow of data requires processing, analysis and interpretation. Therefore, the buyer is always attempting to make sense of volumes of information.

The solution: Identify the buying factors at work. Buying factors are the circumstances pushing the customer to, or away from, the sale. These factors often work to prevent the customer from moving past the status quo. Some of the most common factors deterring customers are:

• The endowment effect: The customer attributes greater value to a solution simply because it's one they already own.

• Loss aversion bias: The customer is more sensitive to the risk of losing than to the benefit of winning.

• Confirmation bias: The customer has an opinion and chooses to focus only on information that “confirms” this opinion.

• Sunk cost fallacy: The customer feels compelled to continue the current course because they've already committed dollars to the endeavor, despite insufficient results.

Leaders often commit substantial spending to selling and marketing tools. However, the most impressive software will likely not change win rates, average deal size or customer experience without the right selling behaviors. These behaviors should account for the buyer’s psychology. Emotion can influence even the most analytical analysis.

The buyers shoulder an enormous responsibility when they're considering a purchase. They must vet every aspect of the solution and align all internal stakeholders. Their success in their role depends on choosing a solution that yields measurable results. Effective sales professionals help the customer navigate the complexities of buying and provide insights that integrate and align the buying group. The sales professional of 2020 is more than a seller — they're a strategic advisor who can act as the North Star by guiding the buyer through the process, which results in a successful outcome for all parties involved.",
"The inventor of the bamboo cutting board, a former New York City firefighter who died in March from a rare form of cancer related to his 9/11 cleanup efforts, didn't live to see his product make it on air. On Sunday's episode, Young's children Kiera, Christian, and Kaley pitched their late father's invention and scored a $100,000 investment--split evenly between all five Sharks--for 20 percent of the company. The Sharks pledged to invest any profits from the business to a charity benefiting firefighters suffering from illnesses related to the 9/11 cleanup.

Cup Board Pro is a tilted cutting board with grooves that direct liquids into an attachable plastic dish. The dish also collects scraps to make cleaning the board easier. Young invented the product after years working as a cook in his local firehouse and publishing a book entitled Cooking With the Firehouse Chef.

When the Sharks learned that the siblings had sold 300 of the $40 cutting boards in just three weeks, they asked the Youngs to step out of the room, and then deliberated privately. One of the reasons the Sharks were so impressed with the Youngs has to do with the tremendous strength the siblings displayed just by appearing on the show. Six years before their father's death, their mother died of breast cancer. Their story also resonated strongly with guest Shark Matt Higgins, the co-founder of venture capital firm RSE Ventures, who was press secretary for New York City mayor Rudolph Giuliani on September 11, 2001. Higgins was at Ground Zero within minutes of the first plane's hitting the World Trade Center.

""When I saw these beautiful kids talk about their firefighter father, my mind went back to all the rescue and recovery workers I met, and people who lost their lives,"" Higgins said during an interview with Inc. He added that the Youngs' story also hit home for him personally, as he is a cancer survivor.

Sunday night's episode has already led to a strong response from viewers, as the Youngs sold 2,000 cutting boards within minutes of the show's airing. In addition to running Cup Board Pro with her siblings, Kaley Young also manages Hot Pilates Secret, a Pilates studio founded by her late mother. ""Both businesses give me so much support,"" Young told Inc.  ""I'm always surrounded by positive people.""

Though the Sharks helped realize a dream for the Youngs--and their late father--by investing in Cup Board Pro, host Daymond John tweeted Sunday about struggling to maintain his composure during their pitch.

Out of my entire decade of being on #SharkTank this was the most emotional pitch I have ever been through. It took everything in me not to walk off the set because my emotions ran so crazy because I was there and lost many friends from 9/11. -- Daymond John (@TheSharkDaymond) October 22, 2018

""That one pitch represents everything that is great about Shark Tank,"" Higgins said. ""The power of the show can inspire people to go the distance.""",
"For most of us, slogging through work and taking commands from bosses from hell, this may seem almost ludicrous. It's been found that employees who think of their bosses as ""partners"" are significantly happier than those who think of their managers as merely ""bosses.""

Bosses as partners? It may not be your own reality, but don't laugh just yet. Science is fully backing this idea in a paper recently published by the National Bureau of Economic Research.

Millions of responses pooled over a period of several years revealed that the happiness boost workers experienced in partner-boss relationships (especially for mid-lifers juggling the demands of professional and family life) was ""equivalent to the increased satisfaction that comes from more than doubling your household income,"" according to the paper.

According to The Washington Post, which first covered this study, ""people with boss-supervisors exhibit a much more significant drop in life satisfaction between their early 20s and mid-40s"" as opposed to people working with partner-bosses.

But still, it's understandable if your cynicism is quick to judge this a bucket of crock. Our worldview of corporate bosses, supported by numerous studies and our own unfortunate daily experiences, holds true that most bosses aren't fit to lead other human beings to bold destinations.

It will require drastically shifting that worldview, both for employees aspiring to find better and healthier work environments and for bosses reimagining a new way of leading. To do so, we have to study the best evidence to help us determine an accurate baseline for modeling the behaviors of ""partner-bosses"" we want to replicate inside our organizations.

It's been found numerous times that excellent customer experiences rely entirely on excellent employee experiences, because it's the employee who makes or breaks the customer connection. Partner-bosses understand this and see extreme value in their workers; they'll pour into their career growth and development and remove obstacles from their path so they can perform at a high level.

A big mistake someone new to a leadership role can make is to enjoy all the perks and privileges that come with being in a leadership role and slowly distance him- or herself to avoid any meaningful involvement with the team. This sort of ""absentee leadership"" is classic rookie territory but nothing you'll see coming from a great partner-boss.

Eventually, a good boss will become a great partner-boss once he or she does something very counterintuitive: surrenders control. In sharing their power and decision-making, delegating tasks, giving access to critical information, and releasing their control over people, a partner-boss will foster high trust and high risk-taking.

4. Partner-bosses ultimately aim to improve the lives of others.

Plenty of evidence suggests that the best leaders motivate and inspire through actionable and practical love, serving the needs of employees before their own, which has been shown to improve performance and lead to business outcomes.

And partner-bosses are no different than so-called ""servant-leaders."" In fact, they may be one and the same. They understand that their role is to make those around them better on a human level so the whole enterprise succeeds.

Partner-bosses set a high bar for themselves. Every day, they walk out the door on their way to work thinking about the answer to one very powerful question: What am I doing today to improve the life of one of my employees?",
"The Great Recession of 2008 saw millions of Americans unemployed, financial institutions in bankruptcy and global markets in steep decline. Unemployment rates peaked at and Americans lost nearly as a result of the financial crisis.

In the midst of all the chaos, however, Peter and Tamara Lobravico saw an opportunity to reinvent their careers and leave their hectic days on Wall Street behind. Pursuing the franchise route made the most sense for the Lobravicos, who had no prior experience in business ownership. As Peter explains, franchises provided a way for the new owners to gain a foothold in a different industry and would allow them to trade their capital for franchisor's industry expertise. Access to a corporate support system also made taking over a franchise a much easier transition.

The Lobravicos narrowed their franchise search to healthcare, specifically, senior care, not only because of the booming industry they were noticing, but also due to their personal experiences. Peter saw firsthand the need that arose after his father passed away from cancer, while Tamara witnessed how her parents struggled to care for her aging grandparents.

Now there were two courses of action to consider. Would they buy an existing franchise location or would they open a new one? While both options provide the security of tried and true plans and processes, they are actually two very different routes. Like buying an existing business, an existing franchise location comes with the benefits of a built-in customer base and historically successful cash flows. Opening a new franchise location does not include the existing benefits, but does offer the owner an opportunity to pioneer a new concept and in a likely untapped market.

For the Lobravicos, the decision to open a new franchise versus an established one came down to cost. Simply put, the pre-existing franchise businesses on the market at that time tended to be overvalued, mainly due to what’s known as “sweat equity.” This means that after all of the work put into building the business from the ground up, there seemed to be an inflated view of how much it was actually worth. It’s hard to put a price tag on blood, sweat and tears, something the Lobravicos now understand. Sweat equity and its likely distortion on a seller’s price is a common inhibitor of deals and one of the primary reasons we recommend working with a business broker or professional valuation expert when setting a price.

Once they decided on opening a new franchise location, the Lobravicos had some field research to do. Would they pursue a large or a small franchise? Favoring a more active role in their new venture, the Lobravicos decided to avoid large franchises. In their eyes, working with larger corporations offered little to no room for negotiations during the transaction process. For that reason, the couple was attracted to smaller, though well-established, franchises. This way they could negotiate the best business plan for themselves while also feeling confident in a proven process, corporate guidance and a working business model.

With hundreds of business opportunities on the market, the Lobravicos ultimately settled on opening an in 2013 for several reasons. Founded in 1966, Interim HealthCare is the nation’s oldest healthcare franchise company and has an established footprint in a variety of business lines from respite care to nursing services and healthcare staffing.

“Interim [also] has a fantastic clinical team and we leaned heavily on the franchisor to provide the clinical support we needed,” Peter said. Recognizing they needed additional help, the Lobravicos hired a registered nurse with 35 years of experience to serve as their clinical supervisor.

Peter also shared that Interim HealthCare’s established history contributed to a smooth transaction. The franchise fee, somewhere around $45,000, was reasonable given the support the Lobravicos received from the franchisor and the fact that the fee covered the costs required to get the business up and running. Today, the franchise earns revenue in the seven figures, is on pace to grow 30-40 percent through the rest of 2018 and the Lobravicos are talking about opening a third location.

Owning a franchise can be a rewarding and financially fulfilling experience for business owners, but it starts with entrepreneurs performing due diligence. Drawing on their learnings as first-time owners, the Lobravicos recommend the following tips for entrepreneurs considering a franchise:

For the entrepreneur thinking about switching careers, franchise ownership is an opportunity to break into an industry where he or she can truly be successful and have zero prior experience. With the support of the right franchisor and proper due diligence, that means new business owners can reinvent their careers in industries that matter to them.",
"“There was just a good chance I would hit him and his men as the tank. He begged me to attack as they were dead men anyway if the tank couldn’t be stopped. When I heard that, I told him to disperse his men as much as possible as I was coming right in. I had my wingman pull up so he could see what was happening if I missed or was shot down, he was to attack the tank. I came in from my dive from a lower altitude than normal, so I could see the tank all the way and made my dive as low as possible to improve my accuracy. I was scared to death that I might overshoot and hit our guys while I released the bombs.” The story of a World War two p-47 pilot

Amy Wilkinson, founder and CEO of Ingenuity, talks about the connection between a military way of thinking with that of an entrepreneur. In her Ted Talk, The Secret of How To Think Like An Entrepreneur, she links military strategist and the United States Air Force Colonel John Boyd’s concept of the OODA loop to entrepreneurial thinking. She states that we can all think like an entrepreneur and one step is to fly the OODA loop.

The OODA loop is a continues four-step process; observe, orient, decide and act. It is a process of preparation so when it comes time to act you are more likely to succeed. As quoted by Confucius, “success depends upon previous preparation and without such preparation, there is sure to be failure.” It is about being able to react quickly to an ever-changing world.

Two heads are better than one, in fact, the more, the merrier. You may be missing something in your observations of, for example, the market that is as clear as day to another. A team of people that balance your abilities will help you see things you didn’t even know was there. Richard Branson advises, “As a leader, you should always be listening. Be visible, note down what you hear and you’ll be surprised how much you learn.”

Now it is time to orientate by making sense of what had been observed. Analyzing the information gathered from the observation stage to see where the company is and where it needs to be. Business leaders make a habit of not being indifferent to what is accruing around them and are always looking for the next way to make something better. The orientation part is the time to have a look at what is next and how the company is going to adapt to the changing times. Utilize the different perspectives of your wingmen and women to help think outside the box.

It’s decision time. Orientation would have presented options. Forecasts of the impact a decision will make must be made to be successful when it comes time to act. This is another reason why others need to be allowed to become involved and make decisions in their area of responsibility. Tom Wilson said, “many of us are more capable than some of us…but none of us is as capable as all of us!” When it is time to take action, enough preparation should have taken place for success. There is always an element of risk, which, can be overcome with belief in what you are trying to achieve.

Elon Musk observed a need for sustainability within transportation and energy products. He observed a potential need of the future and the survival of humanity. His way of thinking is out of science fiction, with ambitious projects such as Tesla and SpaceX. He takes crazy risks and bets his fortune on them because he believes in them. Failure is a part of the journey to success and an inevitable part of life. The idea is to feed the experience back into the loop to think like a business person.",
"People tend to come to me because they want to manage their career burnout or boredom. In my private practice, I’ve worked with as many women as I have men. In fact, studies show that men are generally more bored than women. Boredom on the job can be a temporary feeling or something that won’t go away until you make a job or industry change. It’s a common feeling in the workplace, and it can be defined as a lack of interest or difficulty concentrating. Boredom most often occurs with mid-career professionals, individuals that are underemployed (their skill set is at a higher level than the job role) or those that have recently had a significant shift in work and life values; like new parents. Focusing on being productive isn’t always easy when you’re feeling uninspired or under-challenged. Don’t feel like you’re alone with your feelings of boredom.

A Robert Half blog shared an interesting study showing the following:

When we’re bored at work, we typically clean up emails and our desk, take longer to complete tasks, snack or spend time on social media, or at least, those are some of the things I’ve done and seen others do. Such tasks are time fillers, and they don’t necessarily deal with boredom beyond the time that it takes to complete the ‘filler’ task. Going through something negative, like the loss of a job, career burnout or career boredom, can bring about opportunities for growth.

Here are my five steps to handle boredom at work:

Arianna Huffington believes that we should be listing our sleep habits on our résumés. Her sleep wish list noted in the book, The Sleep Revolution, is pretty amazing. I suspect we'll soon be including aspects of lifestyle screening in recruiting practices. Personality assessments are common in the recruitment process, and our lifestyle can impact our personality. Think of how you feel after nights of poor sleep. If you can’t seem to think outside of the box, then it may be due to not consistently getting 7-9 hours of sleep each night. A 1999 study proved that just one day of poor rest affects decision making and innovative thinking. A lack of energy often comes with being bored, and sleep gives us emotional, mental, and physical strength.

People who lack self-awareness are more prone to boredom. Leading emotional intelligence expert Dr. Travis Bradberry’s research shows that 90% of top performers are also high in EQ and just 20% of bottom performers are high in EQ. According to Bradberry, EQ consists of personal competence, which is made up of self-awareness and self-management skills, and social competence, defined as social awareness and relationship management. When you’re bored at work, it can be easy to blame the job. Thoughts like ‘this job is boring’ and ‘my director isn’t utilizing my skills’ are commonplace. Depending on the cause of your boredom, developing your emotional awareness will help you be more assertive and motivated to implement changes so you’re not relying on senior leadership to fix things.

Try splitting the challenge up into areas like relationships, job tasks, career development and learning. Doing something new every day will be fulfilling. Examples of tasks could include:

There’s one experience that stands out to me of a client working in a building that she didn’t really like. Her experience made me realize that environmental aesthetics can contribute to work values. Perhaps, you need a change of scenery. Our environment can change our mood. Try sprinkling colors like red, orange, yellow or green in your office space as they evoke feelings of happiness.

Revisit the meaning of what you do

Do you feel like you sometimes forget about the impact of your work? Try to meet the people who directly benefit from your work like customers, clients or colleagues. Doing so can energize you. You can also think about the benefits your work provides and why those benefits align with your values. Engagement goes up when we spend time doing meaningful work.

Creating a career plan that looks at each of these steps along with your personal and professional goals can help you handle boredom and burnout in the best way. Boredom isn’t a bad thing, if it leads to actions that aren't time fillers.",
"After years of saying women need to ""lean in"" to their workplaces in order to climb up the ladder, Sheryl Sandberg is now saying it's time for companies to do the same too.

In an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal Tuesday, Sandberg wrote that for more than 30 years, women have been earning more bachelor's degrees than men, yet they still remain underrepresented in organizational charts. The findings arise from the 2018 edition of the Women in the Workplace survey, carried out by Sandberg's Lean In organization and McKinsey & Company, which examines the experiences of more than 64,000 employees and 279 U.S. companies. Despite companies making commitments to gender diversity, the data shows that progress has largely stalled.

""If companies continue to hire and promote women to manager at current rates, the number of women in management will increase by a mere 1 percentage point over the next 10 years,"" Sandberg wrote. Men still hold the majority of jobs in leadership positions today, with 62 percent compared with 38 percent for women.

The report also highlights how gender imbalances within an organization actually affect its culture. When women are overlooked for job promotions, their workplaces tend to become more toxic. For example, more than half of the women in senior roles--55 percent--report that they have been sexually harassed over the course of their career. Compared placeholderwith men, women are also three times more likely to be pressured to provide additional evidence proving they are competent in their jobs, particularly when they are the only women in the room.

Companies' commitment to gender diversity also appears to be waning. According to the study, only 84 percent of businesses surveyed said they prioritize gender diversity, down from 90 percent in 2017. Additionally, employees who believe their companies are committed to gender diversity dropped to 45 percent from 56 percent last year.

For companies that want to address gender disparity in their workplaces, the report suggests a few points of attack. First, ""get the basics right,"" which means you need to set your target goals but also keep track of your progress and hold people accountable if these are not met. Make sure your hiring and promotion practices are fair, and encourage your managers to be ""champions of diversity."" You can also look at your work policies and check if you're offering enough flexibility to help your employees fit work into their lives.

""If companies start hiring and promoting women and men to manager at equal rates, we can nearly close the gender gap in management over the same 10 years,"" wrote Sandberg. ""That's a huge opportunity.""",
"According to a 2012 survey by Adobe, 80 percent of workers in the US and UK indicate they feel pressured to be productive at work instead of creative. These are troubling results for several reasons, not the least of which is that the two options should not be mutually exclusive.

When creativity is paired with productivity, innovation occurs. At our company Amerisleep, we rely on our employees' ideas and their ability to turn those suggestions in actionable solutions in order to produce smarter products, provide more attentive customer service and improve employee engagement.

Below are ways leaders can develop their own creative abilities and help their team do the same.

Create a strategy for acting on your team's creative ideas.

Brainstorming is a worthy activity, but if you want to improve your creative skills you have to move beyond simply suggesting ideas. Improved creativity will only pay dividends when you have a way to harness it, and that involves developing action plans.

Once you have explored the viability of an idea and it moves beyond the brainstorming stage, you must be ready to commit resources towards its execution. When your team members see their ideas manifesting into real solutions, they'll feel even more motivated to nurture their creativity.

Lead by questioning rather than dictating.

In a business setting this has to start at the top, and as a leader you must encourage your team members to reimagine processes and results by doing so yourself. As they observe your eagerness to produce new processes by asking questions, they will be more inclined to apply this type of thinking to their own experiences.

Reduce the importance of hierarchy when it comes to creative thinking.

Great ideas can come from anywhere, and a creative spark that originates from a senior-level manager is no more important or potentially viable than one proposed by a front-line employee.

Creative thinking is everyone's domain. You'll want to ensure that each staff member's ideas will be considered regardless of their title or position.

People hold ideas back because of fear. It doesn't matter whether it's rooted in the judgment of others, a lack of confidence in their own abilities or some unconscious force buried deep in their psyche. The only way to fight back against this inclination is to work to erase the stigma of failed ideas.

Failure is one of the most important parts of creating and running a business, and each undertaking brings important lessons that can be used to guide future success. This is no different when it comes to creativity.

You and your team members must feel free to take risks and suggest unconventional strategies if you want to facilitate creative thinking. Foster an environment where ideas that don't pan out aren't tied to performance reviews or compensation, and live by the value that everyone will have ideas that don't work, even the most creative people.",
"Neuroscientist Sara Lazar, of Mass General and Harvard Medical School, started studying meditation by accident. She sustained running injuries training for the Boston Marathon, and her physical therapist told her to stretch. So Lazar took up yoga.

""The yoga teacher made all sorts of claims, that yoga would increase your compassion and open your heart,"" said Lazar. ""And I'd think, 'Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm here to stretch.' But I started noticing that I was calmer. I was better able to handle more difficult situations. I was more compassionate and open hearted, and able to see things from others' points of view.""

Eventually, she looked up the scientific literature on mindfulness meditation (a category into which yoga can fall). She found the ever-increasing body of evidence that shows that meditation decreases stress, depression, and anxiety, reduces pain and insomnia, and increases quality of life.

In her first study, she looked at long-term meditators (those with seven to nine years of experience) versus a control group. The results showed that those with a strong meditation background had increased gray matter in several areas of the brain, including the auditory and sensory cortex, as well as insula and sensory regions.

This makes sense, since mindfulness meditation has you slow down and become aware of the present moment, including physical sensations such as your breathing and the sounds around you.

However, the neuroscientists also found that the meditators had more gray matter in another brain region, this time linked to decision-making and working memory: the frontal cortex. In fact, while most people see their cortexes shrink as they age, 50-year-old meditators in the study had the same amount of gray matter as those half their age.

Lazar and her team wanted to make sure this wasn't because the long-term meditators had more gray matter to begin with, so they conducted a second study. In it, they put people with no experience with meditation into an eight-week mindfulness program.

The results? Even just eight weeks of meditation changed people's brains for the better. There was thickening in several regions of the brain, including the left hippocampus (involved in learning, memory, and emotional regulation); the TPJ (involved in empathy and the ability to take multiple perspectives); and a part of the brainstem called the pons (where regulatory neurotransmitters are generated).

Plus, the brains of the new meditators saw shrinkage of the amygdala, a region of the brain associated with fear, anxiety, and aggression. This reduction in size of the amygdala correlated to reduced stress levels in those participants.

How long do you have to meditate to see such results? Well, in the study, participants were told to meditate for 40 minutes a day, but the average ended up being 27 minutes a day. Several other studies suggest that you can see significant positive changes in just 15 to 20 minutes a day.

As for Lazar's own meditation practice, she says it's ""highly variable. Some days 40 minutes. Some days five minutes. Some days, not at all. It's a lot like exercise. Exercising three times a week is great. But if all you can do is just a little bit every day, that's a good thing, too.""",
"Showing up in your own skin, without the mask of who you think you should be or who you’ve been told to be can be very intimidating at first. Even when you know your value and what you uniquely bring to a situation, it can feel weird and uncomfortable to break out of your shell. It takes vulnerability to share who you really are and confidence to own those strengths in front of others. Here are some tips for tearing off the mask of conformity and getting comfortable with delivering on your unique value.

Let’s go back to a situation in which you hid your true self. Why?

Was it because you were the most junior person in the room? The only woman or person of color in the room? Or maybe the only person unfamiliar with the topic?

What made you feel like what you have to offer wasn’t good enough?

Feeling like you are not good enough, despite any evidence that this is the truth, is called the Imposter Syndrome. “Imposters” suffer from a chronic self-doubt that overrides any external proof of competence. It can cause them to fade into the background for fear of someone discovering their inadequacies—inadequacies, of course, that do not really exist.

Almost everyone has suffered from the Imposter Syndrome at some point in their lives (including 70% of Millennials and even Reese Witherspoon!), but it can have a particularly strong effect on women as many of our strengths—empathy, emotional intelligence, nurturing, and so on—are often viewed as inadequacies in the male-dominated workforce. In other words, the effects of the Imposter Syndrome are compounded for women by business norms that tell us we are not enough. But I know and you know that this is simply not true.

It is time for us in the world of business to get comfortable with more feminine styles of leadership, which, by the way, could be embodied by both men and women. This is why it is so important for us as women to conquer the Imposter Syndrome.

How can you turn a perceived  limitation into a strength?

Understanding what situations trigger the Imposter Syndrome in you, causing you to shrink away from being your true self, will help you to dismantle those fears and confidently showcase your strengths, even in challenging situations. How can you turn what you have been viewing as a limitation into a strength?

Hopefully, this mindset shift--from limitations to strengths--will empower you to begin breaking down those feelings of “not good enough.” But for many of us, it will take more than that to begin building the confidence to act on these strengths and delivering on our unique value. This is where workplace friends come into play, to lift you up, keep you engaged, and support you on your journey of authenticity.

Practice delivering your value with a friend–then let them amplify it.

Review your calendar for an upcoming meeting where you’ll have the opportunity to provide value. Discuss your goals with a trusted co-worker to help you refine the unique perspective you bring and rehearse how you can speak up. Use those conversations as a safe space to explore how you can confidently communicate your strengths.

And there’s a bonus reason why working on confidence and communicating your value with a trusted coworker can be really beneficial: A friend who knows your unique strengths can reinforce that image of value to people of influence within your organization, amplifying your efforts to build your personal brand. The more people know what you have to offer, the more comfortable you will feel bringing your authentic self to every interaction.",
"Listen, there’s a sea of serious information available at your fingertips—advice that can make you better at your job, achieve your goals and earn respect. The two of us are consistently buried in this type of information. We dig through many studies we find that focus on topics like: performance, engagement, results, or commitment. We’re geeks about charts, data, and graphs that might shed some insight into how leaders can improve their skills. But, still, sometimes it’s the simplest message that reveals the most.

Marie Unanue who has given herself the title of Kindness Advocate, recently released a children’s book, titled The Adventures of Phatty and Payaso. It tells the story of a cat on a mission to stop a bully hawk, and teaches the importance of kindness, as well as concepts like self-control, grit, and social awareness. Ironically, we thought these are many of the same character skills associated with great leadership. “Bullying is a big problem,” Marie told us. “But, in today’s world, even as adults, the lack of kindness is just as big of problem.”

Of course we view kindness as one quality of leadership. And, you don’t have to look very far to find many stories and articles promoting random acts of kindness. But, this made us wonder; is there any research to prove purposeful kindness makes us better leaders? Yes. There is.

Harvard Business School’s Amy Cuddy, along with her research partners, have demonstrated that even before establishing their own credibility or competence, leaders who project warmth are more effective than people who lead with toughness. Basically, kindness and warmth appears to accelerate trust.

But, the link between kindness and great leadership extends beyond just the relationship you have with employees. Interestingly enough, it could also increase employee performance.

Consider this. Researchers at Oxford University analyzed hundreds of published papers that studied the relationship between kindness and happiness. They uncovered   that explicitly prove that being kind to others makes us happier. Add to that research from the University of Warwick that   that people are 12 percent more productive at work than unhappy people.

“Of course we should be teaching children to intentionally practice kindness,” added Marie Unanue, who is now on speaking tour, talking to school children, and building steam behind her kindness movement letsallbekind.com. “But, as adults, we also must be intentional about practicing kindness. Random acts are great. But, let’s not overlook opportunities to be kind on purpose—to make the world a better place, elevate someone’s day, and simply look out for one another.”

Through our work, we’ve had the opportunity to witness some of the best cultures, and meet some of the most prolific leaders in business. Here are four things we’ve found that can help you practice purposeful kindness at work.

Random acts of kindness are important. But, if we want to be great leaders, maybe we shouldn’t focus so much on being random, but instead focus on the one thing great leaders intentionally practice, kindness—especially to the people who support our careers each and every day.",
"The election season is coming to a merciful close, but not before voters are pelted with a flurry of negative ads, false accusations and name-calling.

President Trump is using the migration of Honduran refugees as an occasion to reintroduce his tough stance on immigration. Trump has made the charge, without evidence, that criminals and suspected “Middle Easterners” are included in the caravan heading north. Such a charge is only one of many falsehoods Trump uses in his arguments against Democrats and anyone elsewith whom he disagrees.

Republican candidates are ""falling in line with the president, and it seems they’re trying to scare people about immigrants coming to this country,” Travis Ridout of the Wesleyan Media Project told the New York Times. “This is an election where Republicans are trying to get the base out, and one way to get the base out is by scaring them about Democrats or scaring them about immigrants flooding in.”

Simon Blackwell, retired philosophy professor and author of Truth, told the Washington Post, “If you control the agenda efficiently, then there’s no possibility of independent inquiry.”

David Effron, a professor at London Business School and an expert on the psychology of lies, also spoke to the Post. “When falsehoods feel familiar, one concern is you don’t actually know what’s true and what’s false.” Liars manipulate the truth so effectively that even skeptical listeners “don’t necessarily think it’s unethical to say.”

Social media, according to reporting by Kevin Roose of the New York Times, has become more weaponized. Republican groups have labeled Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri “Crooked Claire” and “Millionaire Claire.” Her fellow Democrat Joe Donnelly of Indiana has been labeled “Sleepin’ Joe.” Democrats, too, have joined in. Democratic congressional candidate calls his opponent “Lyin’ Brian.” Jacky Rosen of Nevada calls her senatorial opponent Dean Heller “Senator Spineless.”

What’s more, political activists are confronting politicians and government officials when they are out in public. Such behavior feeds into the Republican narrative of “mob rule,” though partisans on both sides have been guilty. This is especially true when considering threats made against journalists.

The real reason, however, that incivility is allowed to prevail is that those hurling the insults are not held accountable. For example, there is anecdotal evidence that preteen and teen boys are emulating the president’s insults and boorish behavior, acting out their aggressions and excusing it as “presidential.”

Good news is that nearly 70% of voters, according to a Quinnipiac poll taken in March, do not think Trump is a good role model for children. As outgoing Republican Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona said of the president’s rhetoric, ""The statements… made about people and seeming to ascribe the worst motives to people as well, that's something we tell our kids not to do.”

Republican Senator Ben Sasse, in his new book, Them: Why We Hate Each Other and How to Heal, issues this admonition. “We are in a period of unprecedented upheaval. Community is collapsing, anxiety is building, and we’re distracting ourselves with artificial political hatreds. That can’t endure—and if it does, America won’t.”

Accountability is a cure for misbehavior. For example, an airline passenger accused of groping of a female passenger said, according to an indictment, the “President of the United States says it’s okay to grab women by their private parts.” Fortunately, this crime is considered a federal assault and this perpetrator is facing a maximum penalty of two years in jail and a $250,000 fine.

The cure for politicians who traffic in untruths is the ballot box. As long as voters ignore the insults and negativity--and reward those who use it--the more incivility will persist. Incivility throws a wrench into government. Partisanship used to divide becomes governance turned against the people. And then we all lose.",
"The workplace has changed a lot over the years, and so too has the British workforce. The past decade has revolutionized the traditional nine-to-five, partly down to the development of innovative technologies. Employees are now able to ‘log on’ from wherever they may be, leading to a rise of smarter ways of working – whether at home, in a café or a shared workspace. However, although the way employees work has been updated, company culture often still lags behind, remaining a last priority for many firms. In order to retain a motivated and productive workforce, it’s vital for employers to invest in company culture, especially in an age of remote working. From supplying technology which improves communication to organizing team socials once a month, investing in business culture is invaluable.

Even in an age of remote workforces, bringing the team together will not go unnoticed. Once a month, or even once every six months, organize a team lunch, drinks or social to get the whole team together to celebrate their successes. It’s a chance for staff to build relationships, connect with other members of the team and ultimately help to maintain company culture, facilitating a motivated workforce. Other benefits you could consider include team treats such as shopping vouchers for hitting targets or cash bonuses for winning new business, as these are also ways to ensure your staff feel valued and their hard work does not go unnoticed.

With the rise of flexible working and the technology that accompanies this, there has naturally been a decline in levels of human interaction. Paired with ever-increasing workloads, it’s not surprising that workplace loneliness has dramatically increased over the past five years. Recent research by Timewise revealed that most part-time workers feel isolated, are less up to date with developments at their company and have lost confidence. Therefore, positive communication within workplaces, among colleagues and employers has never been as important as it is now, particularly because of the rise in remote working. Through messaging services, you can easily connect with staff who are working flexibly and using video is an easy way to increase the level of interaction you are having with everyone. Maintaining company culture is not just about providing benefits to employees, it’s also about creating a safe, positive space where workers feel motivated and valued.

When employees do not feel they are trusted by their managers or other colleagues, company culture dwindles and ultimately productivity decreases. Not only is it about building the right kind of team for your organization, it’s about practicing what you preach. The culture of a business often trickles from the top down, so not only is it up to managers to trust employees, it’s also up to you. Managing staff in a thoughtful way will ensure company culture is not lost, particularly with the rise in agile working. Too often than not bosses are quick to judge staff, and with email and instant messaging often used to communicate, conversations can become misconstrued, damaging the business culture as understanding is lost through poor communication.

Overall, maintaining company culture comes down to valuing your employees, something which has become more important than ever before in our era of remote working. With the rise in isolation that has accompanied the advances in technology, company culture has become more meaningful, connecting people and adding value to their work. Investing in your staff and the overall company culture needn’t be expensive, and ultimately will help to facilitate a healthy, happy and productive working environment for all, wherever they may be.",
"The sweepstakes to nab Amazon.com’s second headquarters is down to the wire, with a decision expected by year-end. Twenty cities are competing for 50,000 new, high-paying jobs and a $5 billion investment to build the “HQ2.” There were 238 proposals originally submitted from locales in the U.S., Canada and Mexico before the cut to 20, announced in January.

Seven of the 20 finalists landed in the top 20 of Forbes’ annual Best Places for Business and Careers. Raleigh leads the way, ranked second, followed by Denver (fourth), Dallas (sixth) and Austin (eighth). Amazon’s current headquarters city, Seattle, tops the charts for the first time since Forbes started measuring the business climates of cities two decades ago.

Cities rolled out the red carpet to lure Amazon. Newark offered $7 billion in tax incentives, and the Chicago plan includes at least $2 billion. But who will grab the brass ring? We asked three site-selection experts to make their picks for Amazon’s HQ2 from among the 20 finalists.

Amazon will need to create their own city rather than locate its new HQ2 in the middle of a major metropolitan area. But it will still need to be in close proximity to a major metro for obvious reasons—airport, workforce, plus internet, transportation and economic infrastructure.

As many are saying, the Washington, D.C., area fits the bill perfectly, as far as that nearby major metro, but since Amazon will be looking for a blank canvas and need enough space to create their own city, the rural unincorporated community of Oatlands, Virginia, is the perfect location. It's about striking a balance between being close to D.C. and being remote enough to control their own environment.

There’s also the issue that Amazon does not want their HQ2 to dominate a region. Those 50,000 new employees Amazon has said will be working at HQ2 will bring an additional 120,000 to 140,000 residents to the area in the form of family members, civil workers, and support businesses such as retail, healthcare, and services.

That means that the new HQ2 will be responsible for nearly 200,000 new residents, or a mid-size city like Salt Lake City. A new community of this magnitude needs a mega-metro to provide resources for its development and growth. This requirement eliminates smaller contenders like Austin, Pittsburgh, Raleigh, Indianapolis, and Columbus.

But while Amazon’s HQ2 needs to be near a mega-city, it cannot be directly in a mega-city. With the major influx of population and infrastructure, Amazon needs to avoid the downtown core and essentially create their own city on the outskirts of a major metropolitan area. There is no need to compete for expensive and crowded downtown space.

Amazon can create their own bold vision locating outside the city. Land is much cheaper and office buildings can be built and clustered as desired, rather than shoehorned into existing spaces. Architects and planners can create new communities and neighborhoods which incorporate smart homes and streets which are friendly to alternative transportation. With new homes comes the opportunity to use them as test beds for new Amazon products and services, such as drones and autonomous vehicles, cashier-free stores, and in-home package delivery.

Amazon has proven itself to be bold and creative. Building their own city in a place like Oatlands, Virginia, certainly fits that mold.

Amazon reportedly has made second visits to several cities, including Chicago (my hometown), rekindling speculation, after a quiet summer, about its likely choice.

Amazon knows the statistics. Chicago offers a large, diverse, highly educated workforce; top universities to provide an ongoing influx of new graduates; multiple suitable sites; superior domestic and international air access; international connections and presence; extensive public transportation; hip neighborhoods; robust culture; deep logistics and IT expertise; and a welcoming government. The recent string of headquarters relocations like ConAgra and GE Healthcare to Chicago confirm these strengths.

There has been speculation that the greater D.C. area with three finalists is the likely choice, with many citing the advantage of proximity to government regulators. But how many of those 50,000 future employees will need to interact with the federal government? Let’s say 100. What will the other 49,900 do and what will they need to make Amazon prosper? Amazon did not grow into one of the most prominent companies in the world because it took meetings with bureaucrats.

Some note that Jeff Bezos owns a house in the District, as well as the Washington Post. Chicago is a convenient stop between there and Seattle, housing is more affordable and it is more central to the places they will need to go.

We don’t know how Amazon will evolve in the future, but as potential new paths open, Chicago’s diverse economy provides a deep pool of industry expertise, research capability and consumer knowledge.

Finally, when Starbucks, sought a second location outside Seattle, they chose downtown Chicago in 1987 when Howard Schultz's company had 17 outlets. With 28,000 Starbucks worldwide today, that seems to have worked out well.

The state of Texas is a strong contender for HQ2, which means Dallas and Austin are high up on the list of preferred cities. Other than the D.C. area, Texas and Pennsylvania are the only states that can boast of two shortlisted cities. With Texas consistently touted as the nation’s best state to do business, there’s a strong possibility that Austin and Dallas are being weighed with equal consideration as D.C.

The reasons would certainly be different. In the case of Texas, the cost of living; business-friendly tax and regulatory environment; availability of skilled tech talent; major educational and research and development institutions; air and highway infrastructure; logistics and distribution assets; and economic growth are all arguably stronger than in our nation’s capital.

There are some key differences between Austin and Dallas. Austin is an easier destination to recruit skilled employees. With HQ2 expected to ramp up to 50,000 people, no city can single-handedly absorb that much talent. The winning city will have to be an attractive place to live with a great quality of life, and Austin has quality of life in spades.

Dallas is the more affordable option within Texas and has a reputation as the most business-friendly city in the state. It also serves as the corporate headquarters for industry giants like Exxon Mobil, AT&T and American Airlines. With 7.4 million residents in the Dallas-Fort Worth metro, fourth biggest in the U.S., it has the capacity to accommodate large-scale employers.

"Harriet Braiker is often quoted as having said, “Striving for excellence motivates you; striving for perfection is demoralizing.”

So which one do you aspire to attain? Some people are foolish in thinking that excellence and perfection are the same, while the truth is that they're polar opposites. In reality, the best way to achieve excellence is not to demand perfection.

Perfectionism has more to do with how things appear to others and whether they think they're done right. Excellence is about having a reason and a purpose for what you're doing and being driven by that purpose to achieve results that will ultimately make you succeed. There's a big difference in meaning and intent.

Let’s face it — perfectionism sets you up for failure. It drains you and causes you to think that you'll achieve your goal, all the while being an illusion that's only nurtured by how obsessed you are with the outcome. There's no gain and very little reward, and most certainly, no joy or pleasure is accomplished here. There's only pain and the disillusionment of not being up to par, as well as the ever-present, “What will people think and say?”

Excellence, on the other hand, is singularly focused. It involves having a razor-sharp focus to execute and accomplish what matters and what needs to get done in order to achieve the greatness you seek and in many cases deserve. It's directly correlated to how you apply yourself, how productive you are, staying the course and never losing sight of the end goal. Now sign me up for that.

Maladaptive perfectionism prevents you from starting or completing things you set out to do. Your head and heart get in the way, and you're left inactive, in perpetual inertia and with a constant drip of self-blame, and in some cases, pointing the finger at anyone and anything because you can’t accept the demons inside you that are leaving you paralyzed in the face of getting things done. There isn't much fun there.

Here are some tips to help you navigate and conquer perfectionism and make room for pursuing excellence, which is a much better option all around.

1. Forget the perpetual lie you tell yourself that being perfect will make you successful. It's not true. Hard work, great vision, knowing the right people, asking the right people for help and getting others to believe in your journey make you successful.

2. People don’t relate well to perfectionists. Perfectionism makes the rest of us feel like there's no relatability, no common ground and no equitable human exchange. To put it mildly, it’s intimidating, and people don’t seek out people that intimidate them.

3. There's no power in being perfect. All perfectionism does is show how weak you truly are. Powerful people are comfortable with showing their limitations -- it gives them the pulse to want to do better and better. That’s what people respect.

4. Being perfect doesn't increase nor decrease your self-worth. They just aren't connected. You have to value all of you — the good, the bad and the very ugly — in order to function in a healthy, productive and results-oriented way. If you're focused on how it looks, rather than how it is, you'll never get to your destination.

5. Being perfect isn’t normal or regular. If you get caught up in being perfect, you set yourself up to think that you're beyond and more than everyone else. A word to the wise: Being perfect is an illusion -- it’s not real. Being perfect doesn't give you superpowers that others don't have. All perfectionism does is isolate you from participating in life and from the people around you who, if asked, would gladly help you on your journey to excellence.

People gravitate toward others' strengths, not their weaknesses, and striving for perfection is just that — a sign of weakness. Strong people with conviction are admired and respected. People who think and work alone because they think they're perfect and above all others end up only doing one thing: being alone.",
"Motivation is a big deal. There aren’t many things in life that feel better than peak motivation. It feels like riding a wave, sure of your ability to conquer whatever obstacles lie ahead. You start out on your mission with the picture of a triumphant ending already in mind. I go back to my mountaineering days and see myself looking down from a peak I just summited. You probably have a different image of yourself as a winner, but I’m sure you have one. Motivation is like rocket fuel -- it accelerates your performance and that of your teammates. It’s contagious.

Motivation is also completely and utterly unreliable. You could be doing everything right only to have some external event throw you for a loop. It leaves you at the mercy of things you can’t control. If you’re anything like me, it can and will abandon you when you need it most. Motivational lows are as devastating as the peaks are intoxicating. When things go wrong, they tend to domino. Each setback saps your energy further, making the next failure more likely. Rather than charting your own destiny, you become a victim -- defensive, insecure and looking for others to blame. We've all been there, and it's miserable.

We simply cannot rely on what we cannot control. We need an alternative energy source to propel us forward -- lack of motivation be damned. The word on the street is that when motivation flags, we should turn to routine. We can still be successful when executing behaviors that are trained to the point of being automatic, even when our head’s not in it. This, in theory, allows us to score some points, which in turn helps motivation to recover.

This approach, rooted in athletics, is a powerful tool. In a complex and fast-moving business environment, however, it’s not a magic pill. In training, we can always go back to the basics and call it a day. In real life, we’re expected to respond, on the fly, to the changing environment. It could be that the problems in front of us can wait while we’re building ourselves back up. It could be that our challenges lend themselves to a routine we’ve already established. We could be so lucky, but we simply can’t rely on that. We need to dig deeper.

At my company, we talk a lot about “my why.” A “why” usually comes in the form of a story, often personal. We are a genetics company, working to expand the use of genetic information in medicine. Our “whys” are often stories of people in our lives facing health crises and feeling vulnerable, alone and in need of answers. It’s a way to personify our purpose. A purpose is bigger than motivation -- it’s a must-do, not a want-to-do.

I have met our patients, I have heard their stories and I know that what we do matters and why it matters. Maybe it’s a woman going through miscarriage after miscarriage and looking for answers. Maybe it’s the father of a sick child in the NICU that’s a day or two old and failing to thrive. Maybe it’s someone with breast cancer all over her family tree wondering whether or not she’s next. What unites most of our patients is that they come to us at their most vulnerable. They need our help.

When motivation abandons me, when the challenges in front of me seem insurmountable, when I question whether I have what it takes, I can always turn to my why -- the reason I’m here, doing what I’m doing. It’s not that I don’t have lows. I do and they’re both painful and demoralizing. When they happen, however, I think of my own “why.” Years ago, I myself was that father in the pediatric ICU, full of fear and misery. I remember the difference that getting an answer made. This helps me put one foot in front of the other. Next thing I know, I’m making progress. This is when motivation returns.

Not everyone will have a why expressed in life and death terms. But I guarantee if you look, you’ll find something just as powerful. As leaders, it’s our job to help our teammates connect to their “whys.” This starts with the broader company mission. Over the years, I’ve learned that when I talk about coming change, new initiatives and the challenges ahead, I start and end with the mission. Being able to draw a line from your individual contribution to big-picture goals is massively motivating.

This is a good start, but it’s only a start. A true purpose is personal, and connecting with it is a journey. Here, the only way to lead is by example. You can’t take your teams down your path with you, but you can share your experiences, talk about your struggles and your sources of strength. As your immediate teammates find theirs, encourage them to share in turn, spreading the fire.

At Invitae, our “whys” come up in company meetings, when we're onboarding new hires and in similar formal settings. More importantly, they come up all the time in casual and completely unscripted conversations. Our broader mission is deeply ingrained in our culture, but so is making it personal. This isn't written down anywhere, it’s just something we do. And it starts with leadership.

Do this for yourself, and you will gain access to a source of strength that’s always there for you. Open up, model it effectively, and you will help your teammates find theirs. There’s no fast and easy way to do this, but the impact is staggering. A team where all the individuals have their “why,” where they connect to the mission in their own highly personal way, is a force to be reckoned with. When times are tough, you will slog it out and blow through whatever is in front of you. In good times, you will dominate.",
"Parents age, children grow up, and at some point, adult children face the sobering reality that they will have to care for their aging parents, reversing the roles they’ve always known.

When the time comes for adult children to take on this new role, they can find themselves having to decide how their parents are cared for during the last years of their lives. There are questions to be answered: What kind of care is needed? How can their medical needs be met? Where will their parents be most comfortable?

It can be stressful. Adult children are often caught in the tension of being a son or daughter while becoming a personal care aide or caregiver for their parents. They can even face role reversal where the aging parent wants the adult child to make the decisions for them, especially in scenarios where early dementia or debilitating illness is involved.

It’s hard for adult children to be prepared for the moment when they must take on the responsibility of caregiving for their aging parents. The reality that their parents are losing mobility, decision-making abilities, or even a steady grasp on their daily lives is uncomfortable. Coming to grips with this reality can be daunting and eye-opening. Some adult children are just not ready to see their parents age and will try to avoid the responsibility.

Care for aging parents brings stress. Adult children can end up trying to manage the daily financial, household, healthcare, and long-term planning responsibilities for two households. They may find that their parents are financially insecure. There can be intra-family pressures to face as siblings and other relatives might disagree with the adult child’s decisions concerning their parents.

Adult children can face the nerve-wracking prospect of being forced to become a healthcare “expert” for their parents in the blink of an eye. Many do not have the experience, background, or time to make informed decisions about healthcare. They can face the pressure of trying keep the peace with siblings and other family members while they work to keep their aging parents comfortable and as healthy as possible.

It can be difficult for adult children to know when to step in as caregivers for their parents. In the best cases, the parents reach out and ask for help on their own. In other cases, it becomes a gradual process as parents age, especially in cases where early dementia or disabilities begin to limit their capabilities.

An adult child might find themselves having to take away the car keys from his or her parents, assisting with personal care and meal preparation, or helping them make regular day-to-day decisions. “Where are you going?” and “Who are you with?” become questions that the adult child asks more frequently as their parents age.

Grown children want the peace of mind of knowing that they are giving their parents the same compassionate, caring, and supportive care once given to them, but they are human and have their own limits. They can’t do everything.

Caregiving can be heartbreaking and exhausting. Very often the parent only wants the adult child, and only the adult child, to take on the responsibility and obligation and do whatever it takes to care of them — just like the parent once did.

Caregiving for aging parents can be rewarding. It can also be emotionally taxing, demoralizing, and exhausting. Adult children don’t have to do it all themselves. It’s important to study all the options for care available for aging parents, including assisted living, adult day care, care at a nursing home, or in-home care.

It’s also crucial adult children take care of themselves, especially if they are the primary caregiver for their parents. Studies show that the stress of caregiving can hurt the health of caregivers in the long run. They need to take time to rest and blow off steam.

Open communication with family members is important, so other relatives can provide respite care for the adult child who is shouldering most of the care and decisions of their aging parents. Innovations in technology, especially in the field of remote-monitoring, can provide ways for caregivers to give their parents more independence while keeping track of their daily status.

AARP is a great, deep resource for family caregivers. It can provide educational resources and help in understanding the demands of looking after an aging parent from the family caregiver/adult child perspective.

Parenting their own parents is not a scenario that any adult child wants to face, but in the end, the aging process can often force them into that role. It’s important to remember that caregivers have a duty of self-care. They should educate themselves about community resources and care options for their parents, and never be afraid to ask for help when needed.",
"When Pharrell Williams finished recording the song ""Happy,"" he hopped in his car with his wife and drove around listening to it for an hour straight. He probably wasn't the only one to do so; the track was the best-selling single of 2014 and spent 10 weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100.

Hate the song or love it, there's no denying that it's one of the decade's most successful hits. And it never would have come to be, Williams said Wednesday, if he hadn't been willing to take a leap of faith.

Williams shared a New York City stage with Fast Company editor-in-chief Stephanie Mehta and Chris Meledandri, CEO of production company Illumination, at the Fast Company Innovation Festival.​ Wearing a turquoise baseball cap, dark sunglasses, and short pants that exposed his tall white tube socks--a getup that would make most people resemble a hungover college kid but that he managed to make look cool--the 10-time Grammy winner talked about how he taps into his most creative self as an artist and designer.

""I'm grateful when people see things I can't see,"" Williams said in reference to Meledandri. The two collaborated on the music for 2010's animated feature film Despicable Me, on which much of Williams's work featured his signature hip-hop sound. Until that point, Williams was known largely as a rapper and producer, as well as the founder and head designer of streetwear brands Billionaire Boys Club and I Am Other. For the movie's sequel three years later, Meledandri believed Williams could write an upbeat poppy song--and a good one.

The result took time. ""I made nine songs before I got to ['Happy'],"" Williams said. ""It's like an entire album of 'this ain't it.'""

The song has gone on to garner 600 million streams on Spotify and a billion views on YouTube, earn an Oscar nomination, and become one of the 80 highest-charting singles of all-time--making it by far the biggest hit of Williams's career.

""[Creativity] requires a high level of self-awareness,"" Williams said, with many of his words receiving loud applause from the standing-room-only crowd. ""Comfort is very sneaky. It feels good, and sometimes you don't even realize you're comfortable. But in order to get the best out of yourself, you have to put yourself into positions where you're uncomfortable or vulnerable.""

If you can't seem to get there yourself, Williams advised letting people you trust make your decisions for you--like he did with Meledandri. ""Those are the career risks you have to take,"" he said. ""Those are the ones that are most rewarding.""",
"Jesse Kay is 18 years old. He grew up in New Jersey and during his Junior Year of High School, he started a podcast.

His ambition was to interview successful entrepreneurs, athletes, and other high performers. He wanted to provide a conversation for teenagers to learn how to succeed in life.

The result was that he quickly landed interviews with Gary Vaynerchuck, Joe Polish, and Jack Dorsey.

Within a year, he started having several companies reach out to him, asking for help with their social media marketing. Seeing an opportunity he flipped this unexpected opportunity into a business.

Uniquely, he had several pro athletes seek his help with engaging and monetizing their social influence.

That's the name of the game-- build a following and monetize that following. If you have influence, turn it into value and cash.

How did he do this, was my question.

He told me that persistence was his key. He never took ""no"" for an answer. For instance, he really wanted to interview Jack Dorsey. So after getting several rejections via email, he noticed that Dorsey was doing a Twitter Pariscope. Jesse said he tweeted hundreds of comments during the 30-minute Pariscope. He was asking for a 5-minute interview.

He got that 5-minute interview and turned it into a 30-minute deep dive.

His other key to success was not seeking initial monetization, but to add value and build a network.

He was recently asked to sit on a live Generation Z entrepreneurial panel at the Genius Network Annual Event.

When was the last time you persisted at this level?",
"As of 2018, 75% of businesses have at least one woman in senior management and many of the world's most influential companies now have a female CEOs leading. Women looking to secure their place as a leader should find confidence in this evolving business landscape. And companies who value diverse ideas and experiences set their organizations up for future advancement.

Everything from handling chaos to maintaining a competitive advantage to people problems, organizations today need diverse thinking, ideas, and perspectives to help them uncover creative and innovative solutions to the layers of complicated challenges we face.

This is why we're celebrating the diversity that women leaders, entrepreneurs, and small business owners bring to businesses today--because gaining the perspective of others make us all stronger and more successful in the end.

"When you're facing constant change and disruption at every turn, you want employees to think like entrepreneurs. This may seem like a contradiction, but when employees think about the value they're creating and remain resilient through hard times, your company benefits.

Blake said, ""It comes down to the willingness for them to take risks."" He told me The Home Depot's founders wanted their team members to think and behave like their name was on the front of the building. When employees aren't afraid to take risks, they grow.

Thinking like an entrepreneur is about value creation and resourcefulness. Entrepreneurs know how to assess risks and make decisions for the good of the company. You want your people to have an entrepreneurial mindset so they do this -- even when you're not around.

Leaders who push team members to think for themselves provide space for those people to grow. When your employees think about the value they're creating through their work, it allows them to see the big picture. You want them to value resources by trimming extra steps and costs.

In some organizational cultures, it's unsettling to let employees think for themselves. Let me remind you of a leadership truth: If leaders don't let employees think for themselves, they'll soon be surrounded by people who can't think for themselves.

Giving your people time to think will make them feel they have ownership in the business -- and it will be reflected in their work.

2. Allow them to make decisions.

Embracing employees' ability to think like an entrepreneur requires them to make decisions -- even if they make decisions you wouldn't have. The art of decision-making under pressure -- and with limited information -- is a skill that can be learned.

Mike Michalowicz, the author of Clockwork, talked on my podcast about the trap many leaders set when they train employees to keep coming back to them for decisive insights. If you want your business to run like clockwork, you must let employees think independently about processes, risks, and goals so they can make their own decisions.

Entrepreneurs are resilient on the journey to success. You want your team members to have such deep levels of ownership that they become resilient in their work and feel safe taking risks.

Michalowicz said that one thing leaders have to remember when employees make decisions is that they must be OK with the outcome -- good or bad. If an employee feels you let him down, he'll lose confidence in himself and rely on you to make decisions. You don't want your team members to fall into the trap of deciding, ""where they wait for you to make a decision to move forward,"" as Michalowicz says.

One reason they prefer being employees is that it allows them to avoid taking risks. A leader's job is to help employees think through the implications of a decision to minimize its downsides.

I've been an entrepreneur for more than 20 years, and I've built several seven-figure companies by thinking like one. I've always valued my employees' ability to think for themselves -- I can't do it all alone. It can sometimes be painful, but it's necessary.

I was sick once and trusted my team to take care of all client shipments that Friday afternoon. Usually, I checked everything to make sure the shipments were right. They made more than 20 shipments. Reviewing the previous day's work, I noticed one client didn't receive an order. That mistake cost me more than $12,000 and a valued client. It was an expensive lesson to learn, but we all realized then that we needed an end-of-day system to ensure mistakes like this wouldn't happen again. My big lesson? I hadn't let them think for themselves before that moment, and it came back to bite me.",
"If you were more athletically inclined when you were younger, gym class is probably something you can look back on and remember fondly. If you're still harboring any negative feelings towards your childhood gym class, however, the way you think about exercise and fitness now as an adult could actually be negatively impacted.

A team of scientists at Iowa State University found that how we respond to memories of gym class from years or decades ago may ""shape how we feel about exercise today."" This means how or whether we choose to be physically active today can actually be tied to our positive or negative gym class experiences from the past.

With two-thirds of Western world adults rarely exercising, researchers at Iowa State wondered how our attitudes about exercise have defined and shaped whether or not we stay sedentary. In particular, these researchers wanted to know how we develop beliefs about physical activity in the first place.

So researchers asked study participants how they felt about exercise right now, what fitness habits they have today, and how much time they spend sitting or in motion. Participants were also asked to describe their single best or worst memory from PE -- early gym classes were selected as important memories to consider because for many of us, these classes were the first introduction we had to formal exercise.

The study, published in the Translational Journal of the American College of Sports Medicine, details how for many of the study participants, memories of gym class turned out to be ""vivid and emotionally charged."" The most consistent descriptions associated PE classes with unpleasant memories -- memories that led to a ""lingering resistance"" to habits of exercise years later. Those who failed to enjoy gym class during their childhoods tended to report that they did not plan on exercising nor did they expect to like exercising.

On the other hand, those who enjoyed gym class were ""more likely to report that they expected exercise to be enjoyable and that they were active on weekends.""

These results remind us that our feelings and attitudes towards exercise play a crucial role in how we move, if we move at all. If you think you simply aren't destined to be fit, remember that perhaps a single bad experience in gym class from years or decades ago may be coloring your exercise experiences now.

Bad experiences from 3rd period gym class do not have to affect you forever -- if you want a healthier life full of fitness, the choice can be yours. Starting right now.",
"Do you notice a pattern? Managers have direct influence over every one of these causes for employees quitting. To reverse such scenarios will require a lot of hard conversations and a commitment to culture change.

To set the right conditions for a high performing culture, where people have meaningful work, purpose, and look forward to arriving at their jobs each morning, leaders must consider their employees as business partners and engage their workforce in an entrepreneurial way. When employees are made to feel as if they own a small business, company morale skyrockets and your turnover will do a 180°.

This entrepreneurial spirit of engaging and collaborating is not pie-in-the-sky stuff. It's an attitude that you allow to filter down to the staff level so they can actively seek out change, rather than waiting for marching orders.

Since culture is a huge component of these thriving organizations, leaders and employees open to the idea of unleashing the entrepreneurial spirit across their organizations must work together to foster a culture that enables ideas to flow from anywhere within the company.

Letting people take their ideas and see them through is very empowering and motivating for maintaining an entrepreneurial spirit as the company grows. Here are six ways of making it happen.

1. Allow people to think and act like owners.

Employees should feel empowered to make decisions, and managers should believe enough in them and their potential to allow it to happen. That may require a significant shift in management to hand off the reins to employees and simplify decision-making processes and approvals.

For people to think and act like business owners, rules need to minimized. Unnecessary policies coming from bureaucracy stifles the entrepreneurial spirit. So before setting down another new policy, consider going on a rule diet. Engage workers by enlisting a cross-functional team that meets and strategizes ways to keep the bureaucracy to a minimum.

3. Allow people the opportunity to drive.

If a team member comes up with an idea that may not be part of their ""scope of responsibility,"" help connect them with the right teams and let them bring their ideas to life. Whether you're the boss or a senior co-worker, try to give them that opportunity to drive something. It will expand their skills, thinking and creativity. And....ultimately drive up your morale and employee engagement scores.

If employees are being asked to think like business owners, they need the access to the same information that owners receive; they need to be brought to the table for input and be included in important conversations; they need to be invited to meet top customers and clients; they need a clear understanding of the big picture, strategic goals, changes of direction, and what's going on in the minds of management.

6. Give employees voice and the freedom to ask anything.

Great leaders always grant their valued employees a voice that can be nurtured, not criticized, in order to bring innovative ideas forward. This is truly built around collaboration -- the concept that no idea is a bad idea. Leaders must also foster a transparent culture by allowing for any question to be asked, even the tough ones! Then address them in a town-hall meeting, as uncomfortable as it may feel. This will dramatically increase trust with your employees and build a collaborative, inclusive culture.",
"In a new report, IDC states that the days of a single architecture dominating all compute in the datacenter are over.

Artificial intelligence initiatives have become priorities for businesses, and most of the standard infrastructure being used in the datacenter is not suitable for the data-intensive nature of AI workloads. The performance and I/O of your typical server can’t keep up with the demands of deep learning. This has led to what IDC calls “emerging processor diversity” in the datacenter.

This processor diversity has led to an increased presence of GPUs, FPGAs, and many-core processors – as well as better links between the host and the accelerator. While accelerators are key in increasing performance, it’s the interplay with a host processor that unlocks the blazing performance that AI workloads demand.

Organizations will also need to rethink the way they are managing their data. It is a necessity to build connections and synthesize various data sources in order to successfully execute AI initiatives. Data sources for AI include both those that are under a business’ control and external data such as social media behavior.

To handle all of this unprecedented data, IBM has introduced a concept called “AI Infrastructure,” consisting of a single platform for data pipelines, services, and AI. It’s an end-to-end server, storage, and software platform designed for businesses to stand up their version of the AI revolution.

At the heart of this AI Infrastructure is the IBM Power System AC922 and IBM PowerAI. The Power AC922 is a two-socket server that has been optimized for AI acceleration, including extremely fast I/O architectures, including PCIe Gen 4, CAPI 2.0, OpenCAPI, and NVLink, all of which are ideal for data-intensive workloads. Two POWER9 CPUs and from 2 to 6 NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs with NVLink deliver extreme performance between CPUs and GPUs for HPC, deep learning and AI workloads.

PowerAI is an enterprise software offering that makes deep learning and machine learning more accessible for organizations looking to deploy a fully optimized and supported AI platform. PowerAI comes packaged with open source deep learning frameworks and tools such as Caffe, Torch, TensorFlow, Theano, and Chainer.

This hardware/software package aims to give businesses a quick way to get started with deep learning by providing enterprise-ready open source software, high-performance hardware and integrated tools that will boost productivity. Reducing complexity is always a high priority, and IBM is making it easier to get an optimized deep learning framework in place. PowerAI was built to save you time and effort, boasting an approximate 45-minute installation of a complete DL environment from bare metal to something you can begin training on.

IBM Elastic Storage Server (ESS) is also a key component of AI Infrastructure and is the ideal storage approach to the advanced data lake. ESS is a software-defined storage solution that allows for high performance while avoiding the creation of data silos and makes storage management easier.

AI is developing rapidly, and teams will need to create a long-term strategic approach to how they adopt it. Similarly, business needs will shift through the years, so it will be critical to build a system in such a way that they will be able to surround everything with AI without suffering in performance.

IDC believes that AI requires different infrastructure than what has been the standard for many years. To learn more about how IBM is uniquely positioned to help businesses meet that need, download the full report here.

"When we hear the word “micromanagement” we think of it as a negative behavior. You type micromanager on Google and it gives you definitions like “to control every part, however small, of (an enterprise or activity)” accompanied by some images of angry bosses standing with binoculars at the desk of their employees, topped with dozens of articles on how to quit this toxic management style. It even feels like you Googled a bad habit like smoking. And yet guess what some of the greatest leaders on this world have in common? You guessed it right—micromanagement at its finest. Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates are only a few examples of outstanding leaders who happen to excel at micromanagement. Elon Musk even describes himself as a nano-manager. So how come we only see the negative connotation?

Let's flip that micro coin and look at the other side of it. Let’s apply positive thinking and try to upgrade our perception of what micromanagement is. When speaking about micromanagement from a CEO point of view I often joke that “A micromanager is a person that all CEOs want but most employees probably hate”.

Yes, being a micromanager is usually connected to being a control-freak, paying attention to details, being picky. Most authors connect it to distrusting people, thinking that you can always do it better than the others etc. And if this is the case how did this trait develop? Is it because all these managers have worked with people who did not or could not deliver as they were expected? Or is it because leaders who excel at micromanagement have very high expectations and are striving for perfection? And is everyone capable of controlling and being involved in many fields at the same time? Can everyone be or become a micromanager?

I believe micromanagement is a skill (if done right) not everyone can be good at. Not everybody has the capacity to watch and control every single step of a process. Bosses who stick their noses into every single detail because they have nothing smarter to do are the representative of micromanagement done wrong. But bosses who closely monitor, provide detailed guidance and corrective feedback when needed are something totally opposite.

Here are seven reasons why micromanagers can be great for teams and companies at the same time:

1. They are highly involved and engaged with their teams. They know their people and the work they do. They have better communication skills as they communicate with their colleagues to provide guidance and ensure the result is outstanding.

2. They are able to foresee and prevent. They take care of all the details and possible drawbacks striving to prevent or mitigate any possible negative outcome.

3. They want to get the best out of people. No leader wishes to correct mistakes but hopes that when they recheck the situation the feedback is rather positive than negative. Being a micromanager is not about waiting for people to make mistakes. It's about wanting to reassure that every single detail is being taken care of.  And it involves teaching, mentoring and pushing people to their potential on the go, hence constantly improving their skills. Micromanagers want to control the outcome, not the people involved.

4. They can develop empathy naturally. Micromanagers can put themselves easier in the shoes of the others cause they know what it takes to get the tasks done. They know the skills, strengths and weaknesses of their people, and can understand them pretty naturally. And understanding sets the bases for knowing when to push and when to step back and give them some space.

5. They know what, when and to whom they can delegate.   It is better to have a micromanager who knows the job his team is doing than a macro manager who delegates without knowing what it takes to get a certain task done. I personally know many of the later ones and I call them ""the forward managers"" cause most of the day they forward emails to their team without even reading them. A micromanager has probably done the tasks he is delegating and can make the right decisions when delegating.

6. They can adapt their style to different characters. Since their goal is a perfect end-result they have to find ways to get all involved people on board who call for different ways of guidance, feedback and motivation.

7. They can add value to almost any given department. If there is a customer complaint that can damage your company’s reputation and your head of Customer Care is a micromanager he will go over every detail, investigate the situation, try to locate the root of the problem and try to handle the situation in the best possible way. Same applies to other departments and internal processes such as during onboarding new employees, updating systems, implementing changes etc. Good micromanagers can be the safety net that any department needs.

Therefore micromanagement done right can have positive effects not only on the overall outcome but on the morale, productivity and culture.

Every leader dreams of having people who he can trust and rely on, people who have an eye for details, who can pay extreme attention to what others are doing and who can get things done perfectly. If this is the case that it would be logical to assume that every leader or CEO would love to have micromanagers in their teams.

At the end of the day there are things that are very important and should be micromanaged and there are things that are not the most important thing for the company and should just be delegated. As Gary Vee says, it is important to have a good radar for deciding what is important and what is not.

So far I haven’t been proud to admit or tried to push back when people would tell me that I am a micromanager. But every coin has two sides and if positive psychology says that we can regard stress as a positive thing why can’t we look at the bright side of micromanagement. I am a positive micromanager who is happy to hire and work with micromanagers. As far as I am concerned if I was looking for a job I would put micromanagement as a skill in my job application.",
"I interview hundreds of strong candidates every year, and I recognize that joining a startup is a big commitment. It's not like any other job, and, unfortunately, I rarely see candidates ask the right questions to understand if it is the right place for them.

Joining the right startup at the right time can seem like winning the lottery, but by knowing the right questions to ask you can identify a company that is primed for growth and built to last. These companies have what I like to call ""resilient cultures."" To identify a resilient culture, understand how the company indexes on growth orientation and intentionality of culture.

Growth Orientation: How fast is its growth and how ambitious are its goals?

Startups are defined by growth. In growth environments, there is often an accelerated rate of challenges to overcome, which requires you to quickly master the learning curve. High-growth companies almost always come with more opportunity to make an impact and have more ownership over projects.

Intentionality of Culture: How thoughtful is the company's approach to its culture?

If you asked every employee in an organization why it exists (the company's purpose) and what it strives for in how it operates (its values), would they all give you the same answer? Companies that make it a priority to spend time building a strong, well-defined culture with good alignment across teams have intentional cultures. Research extensively shows that companies that deliberately work on culture have a higher likelihood of success. Their team members go to work because they have ownership over the company's purpose, not just to collect a paycheck.

Because resilient cultures have been battle-tested by growth and strengthened by tough times, they are built to last. There is rigor and ownership in performance, and you'll see an element of optimistic dissatisfaction from team members -- not just leadership. Most importantly, these teams demonstrate an extraordinary amount of curiosity and are constantly learning. In a resilient culture, your role will be tough, but your personal growth will be unprecedented. It will challenge you, excite you and inspire you to be your best.

Interview Your Interviewer: How to Assess Company Culture

Does joining a resilient culture sound like the right next step of your career? Use the quick guide below to help you identify resilient cultures during your interview process with some tough questions you can ask your interviewer.

What to look for in their answer: Look for easily recited, ambitious goals with clear accountability for what could be improved. Great companies will have a strong perspective on how this knowledge is transparent across the organization. For the best insight, ask this question to a team member, not a founder or executive.

What to look for in their answer: Resilient cultures are feedback-intensive environments that come with high degrees of trust. It should be commonplace for team members to give each other feedback and feel great about it along the way.

What to look for in their answer: Company culture is an insurance policy through the tough times -- it is not defined by when things are going well. Companies that have ambitious goals will inevitably see some dark times. Look for companies with real stories of tough times that aren't afraid of telling them.",
"All too often, I see companies with a refined focus and management discipline on driving global efficiencies in the physical supply chain, only to see a laggard strategy and performance within the financial supply chain. I often wonder how these two can be so disjointed given the two processes are an extension of one another. In a recent study analyzing working capital in different companies, industries and geographies, the study sighted a greater than two-day deterioration in days sales outstanding (DSO) over the past four years.

Some may argue that optimizing DSO is not important right now given that debt capital is relatively inexpensive and running a global business is becoming more complex, given that regulatory and financial accounting rules differ from country to country and change with some degree of frequency. Others may suggest that organizational issues invite different degrees of emphasis on optimizing the physical supply chain over the financial supply chain. Yet no one challenges the assertion that, when it comes to inter-enterprise relationships, the optimization of the order-to-cash process is critical.

Optimizing the physical supply chain and financial supply have similar challenges in that they require the organization to persuade their eco-system of partners (customers, suppliers, banks) to spend capital, time and human resources to facilitate a digital integration such that information can flow from one partner’s information system to another. The good news is, once an eco-system partner is digitally connected, the variable expense to support additional data signals over the connected infrastructure is relatively low.

Optimizing the order-to-cash process in an inter-enterprise environment invites multiple constituents, given that an inbound order is radically different than an outbound order and that each process is often managed by different organizational management leaders. The chief revenue officer (CRO) or executive vice president (EVP) of sales will often be the champion for any integration with a customer, whereas an outbound order to a supplier might typically involve the EVP of procurement. In both cases, the process impacts finance, as these digital processes all have a potentially positive or negative impact on cash.

A chief financial officer (CFO) who partners with sales and/or procurement to help optimize the physical supply chain can often optimize the financial supply chain. Without this tight partnership, the sales leader will often optimize the inbound order and the outbound shipping process only to ignore the invoicing and payment collection process, believing this is better left to the CFO. As a result, only a portion of the order-to-cash process becomes digitized and optimized. Likewise, a lack of partnering with the procurement leader leads to an optimized process of ordering and receiving goods only to leave the inbound invoicing and payment process manual.

Doing business globally may also require your company to log on to numerous banking portals to get basic information regarding receivables that have cleared, payments that have cleared and the balance of idle cash. Moving this banking information back into the ERP via the bank portal can be error-prone, slow, expensive and a hindrance to providing timely cash forecasts. Regulatory banking laws have filtered your selection of banks in the country in which you do business. As a result, your ability to monitor cash is hindered by the islands of banks you use. Information from the banks’ systems can digitally and automatically transcend nightly into the organization’s ERP systems, enabling a fresh, daily cash forecast.

CFOs seeking to create greater efficiencies and shareholder value will need to become more involved in processes they traditional ignored. CFOs need to think about how they partner with their peers to take advantage of this digital integration with a supplier or a customer. A recommended set of next steps should include the following:

Your peers in the supply chain may have already integrated customer procurement and logistics signals directly between your company’s ERP system and those of your customers. Your customers may already support the ability to accept a digital invoice and make a digital payment. In most cases, your customer will dictate the data formats and you'll simply need to adhere to them. This population of customers would be where I would focus your efforts first, as there is no need for lengthy conversations about large upfront investments and negotiating over what the data flow will look like. You are simply adding two transactions onto an existing relatively fixed-cost infrastructure.

Survey Options With Your Banks Regarding Corporate-To-Bank Integration

Sorry to say, but every bank does it differently, and your options will be largely dependent on where you fall relative to your financial value to the bank. The bottom line is, most every bank will provide some level of electronic information feed and accept a digital payment. The documentation and rules associated with the bank integration will be already prepared and can simply be requested. If you have multiple banks, your integration priorities will be influenced by the issues you are trying to solve. If you are trying to reduce labor expense and time delays in cash forecasting, prioritize the banks where you have large transaction volumes. If you are trying to reduce loan expenses in certain regions, prioritize the banks in these regions such that you can facilitate quick cash forecasts and optimize the movement of money.

Survey What Aspects Of Order To Cash Process Have Not Been Optimized

Processes around direct versus indirect material buy are often radically different inside the company. If you have moved indirect material buy to purchasing cards (P-Cards), then focus on solutions for direct material. Evaluate whether your direct material suppliers are already digitally integrated with the procurement team. If yes, then work with your procurement team to extend these digital links to include inbound invoicing and outbound payments. If your procurement team has not integrated key suppliers, work with your procurement team to develop a strategy to deploy a digital integration with key suppliers that represent at least 80% of your direct material spend.",None
"As with any company or business, employees also experience a life cycle with distinct and actionable phases. Knowing each stage and how it can be leveraged helps leaders and practitioners deliver the best results when implementing business or talent management strategies in any environment.

The employee experience is inextricably linked to engagement, so managing the employee life cycle can be essential for an organization’s performance and growth. I have always found segmenting employee engagement activities by stage during workforce planning produces much better results. You may be asking yourself what the stages are and why they matter, so here is a simple model for a complex topic: hire, inspire, admire and retire.

As the first step of the employee life cycle, it is quite possibly the most important. The law of unintended consequences thrives in this phase. With each new hire, the organization experiences positive or negative impacts to company culture, workforce productivity, client satisfaction and even organizational innovation.

Leverage this stage in the process by communicating frequently with candidates and hiring for attitude or behavior — you can always train for skill, if gaps exist. Hiring a technically skilled employee with a poor personality is clearly not a winning strategy, so look for someone who can elevate the team while playing well with others at the same time. Make sure to turn your onboarding process into an integration process that goes beyond just system access and administrative tasks.

Retention starts with recruitment, so the second phase may be the most difficult. Now that the company has the right people in the right places, it’s time to inspire your workforce to perform to their fullest potential. High performers can produce more than 400% more (registration required) than average employees, so inspire them by removing barriers, granting autonomy and providing them with mentorship.

Leverage this stage by making employees feel like part of the team: Challenge them with realistic goals, and provide opportunities for them to develop and grow. Make sure they feel trusted. Give them purpose, and invest in their individual development.

If other phases of the life cycle seem like a sprint, this one should be viewed as a marathon. Admiring your workforce never ends because it has a direct impact on employee engagement, motivation and satisfaction. It is well known that most employees quit managers, not companies. As Steve Jobs famously said, it doesn’t make sense to hire smart people and tell them what to do. Give them parameters? Yes. Set goals? Of course. Micromanage? Absolutely not. You hire the most talented people to let them do what they do best, so give them the tools to succeed, and get out of their way.

Leverage this stage by giving employees room to work, constant constructive feedback and rewards or recognition for their achievements. Make sure your employees feel heard, have buy-in whenever possible and have a sense of empowerment.

This phase represents the end game for the employee life cycle. Having employees retire within your company may represent the ultimate organizational success. Variations in workforce generational characteristics may reveal what success looks like, but there is no question of the impact on the company’s brand and bottom line from the long-term retention of employees.

Leverage this stage by soliciting key retirees as mentors and coaches. Retirees with decades of experience can facilitate knowledge transfer, skill development, client relationship-building and employee networking. Lastly, make sure your exit interviews capture the feedback of any departing employees. This insight is invaluable for improving your business and improving future employee retention.

Employees are the lifeblood of any organization. Applying employee life cycle thinking to your talent management process will deliver better performance outcomes, improve the company’s bottom line and grow the organization’s brand as an employer of choice.",communication
"“I was expecting your call last week.” An air of exasperation and disappointment permeated the prospect’s voice as his words came through the phone.

Steve, the millennial salesperson on the other side of the line, backpedaled feverishly. “Sorry, but it wasn’t actually my fault that I’m late getting back to you. My colleague was supposed to give me the information and didn’t, so I had to ...”

Steve was not one of my employees. I was a consultant brought in to help the company fix its lackluster sales results with its younger new salespeople following a massive rebranding initiative. As I listened to a recording of the call, I found myself increasingly bothered by Steve’s words and tone. When the prospect pushed back, Steve did what many do when they’re backed into a corner: He made poor excuses and played the blame game. By trying to salvage the remains of a relationship he’d just burned to a crisp, Steve lost his prospect’s trust. And the company lost the business to a competitor.

Leaders often struggle to connect the dots between individual character, sales team performance and corporate culture. Steve’s story illustrates just how damaging a lack of character can be on sales performance and business results.

Wise business leaders know how easy it is to destroy business relationships. In my survey of nearly 300 business leaders, 60% admitted to being concerned about how to work with the millennial generation, and 45% of those respondents named character issues as a top concern.

Some of the specific issues that are rooted in character are:

• A lack of grit and determination to tackle difficult projects, which leaves team members and clients in a lurch

• Lax follow-through on commitments, which negatively impacts both internal and external relationships

• Refusal to take accountability for actions and blaming anyone and anything other than themselves for their lack of results, which stalls creativity and innovation

Business owners and sales leaders have a bottom-line reason to be concerned. Personal accountability, along with determination, resilience and integrity, are vital character attributes of any successful leader or salesperson who desires to be successful over the long haul.

Is it possible to develop a strong character core in your emerging sales leaders? Every ethical dilemma, every test of integrity and every trial of determination challenges the character of all leaders, including emerging sales leaders. These are the moments when character strength is forged. It's this internal strength which ultimately positions them as trusted advisors who can handle increasingly difficult and challenging scenarios over the long haul.

Growing a strong character that positively impacts both top-line revenues and bottom-line results starts with a commitment to a code (i.e., making a commitment to something higher than oneself). For some, that code is the Golden Rule. For others, it might be the Ten Commandments or certain virtues or values that they hold dear.

Having grown up on a ranch in North Dakota, I’ve found that the cowboy code of ethics, also known as the Code of the West, resonates deeply with me. I believe you might find that this code (with our business application add-ons) inspires you and your sales leaders as well.

1. Live each day with courage. Don’t let fear keep you from having the tough conversation, asking the deep-level question or owning up to your mistakes.

2. Take pride in your work. Go the extra mile to show your prospect and clients that you're a trusted resource.

3. Always finish what you start. Develop the grit that refuses to quit until the job is done.

4. Do what has to be done. You’re never above doing the mundane or frustrating work that needs to be done to help the team succeed.

5. Be tough, but fair. Demand more from yourself and others, but never at the expense of truth and integrity.

6. When you make a promise, keep it. Never go back on your word.

7. Ride for the brand. Your actions always represent the brand and can have a positive or negative impact on everyone. When making character choices, remember that your actions don’t only influence yourself. They might also impact your colleagues, clients or community. Choose wisely.

8. Talk less and say more. Listen deeply first so that you can offer the best solution.

9. Remember that some things aren’t for sale. Certain things, like your integrity, should not be up for sale. If you have to compromise your character (values) to get a sale, the price is too high.

10. Know where to draw the line. A strong commitment to success still has to be legal, ethical and not hurt others.

Whether your millennial sales leaders have a strong character already or not, you have the opportunity to guide them to connect the dots. It’s never too late. Show them how they can create a win-win scenario. By building a courageous character, they can reach their personal development goals and boost your company’s business growth.

Work with your team on each point of the cowboy code of ethics. How can you help them grow? What can you do to keep them from doing what Steve did during that atrocious phone call?

As a coach and mentor of millennial leaders, you're in a position of immense influence. You stand at the intersection of individual character, team performance and corporate culture.",
"Many assume power comes from “outside-in.” They believe power is granted to a person by someone else. They see power as a position or title, which comes with authority and control, and a belief in the form of supremacy over others.

Others believe that real power comes from “inside-out.” They maintain that power is the ability of each individual to cultivate by themselves. Real power is increased within a person simply by the choices they make, the actions they take, and the thoughts they create.

I define power differently. It doesn’t matter what the organizational chart says. Power is available to everyone, no matter their position or title.

Real power is influence, and it increases as we offer more support to others. Being powerful is more about giving support than getting support. Contrary to what you may have thought about power, service is the highest form of leadership. Serving others is a key to sustainable growth. And it creates the kind of influence that truly powerful people wield—the kind that resonates and uplifts.

Real power is clarity, and it gets stronger with discipline. Having power is more about creating an environment that encourages every individual to engage in their own form of self-discipline. That’s not to say discipline never comes from above, but by empowering each member of an organization to be accountable, discipline from above will not be required as frequently. Discipline brings clarity to any situation, increasing an individual’s power.

Real power is energy, and it intensifies from inside as our insight and self-understanding grow. Insight is an integral element of being powerful. A person with real power does not influence the world around him or her without consideration of the bigger picture that begins inside. From my experience with this vantage point, true growth—both personal and professional—is far more likely. Insightful individuals are able to tap into an internal energy that is felt by others as power.

Real power is impact, and it grows as we focus on our creativity. Creating the future is not about waving a magic wand. It is a concrete practice that serves the purpose of being powerful with a purpose. Creative solutions make an impact—on people, organizations, and societies. Real power sometimes comes from the unlikeliest of places.

Real power is confidence, and it rises as we better understand and live our values. What do you stand for? When you speak about your values and act accordingly, you increase your power because you are confident in your assertions. The power is palpable—and effective.

Real power is what happens when people connect what they do to who they are.

Once anyone in a group chooses to become more powerful, everyone around that person becomes more powerful. Research supports this view. Scientists have found that positive emotions spread from person to person in a work environment. An individual’s or group’s emotion plays a strong role in the behavior of an organization.

Studies show that positive mood or emotion enhances creative problem solving, cooperation, decision quality, overall performance, the search for creative solutions, and confidence in being able to achieve positive outcomes. One study by Yale researcher Sigal Barsade, PhD, found that a spread of positive emotion is associated with improved cooperation, decreased conflict, and increased task performance in the workplace. The call it “the ripple effect.”

I’ve experienced this cascading effect again and again throughout my career. I call it viral engagement.

When an organization builds effective, integrated strategies in six areas—customer, competition, financial capital, cost, community, and climate—they establish the conditions for creating real power. When the organization deploys plans in the following areas, a truly powerful organization is created:

Measure and improve employee engagement; ensure diversity and gender-balanced leadership; consistently assess, improve, and expand employee “hard and soft” skillsets; add new skillsets when necessary; align team members around a values-based vision for the future; and build a change-adaptive culture to meet accelerating changes in market needs tied to management’s strategic decisions.

What could happen if your organization recognized where true power comes from?",
"The last time you had a big interview, did it feel as if you were being measured and assessed? Did you wonder whether you'd left your prospective employer with a strong enough sense of how experienced, capable and engaging you came across in your answers?

I often get asked to coach people for big, life-changing interviews and I thought I'd share the number one mistake candidates make, as well as what you can do to transform the experience to your advantage.

Instead of obsessing about what the interviewer will think of you, shift the spotlight away from your own neuroses onto how the person you're talking to feels about themselves while you are in the room.

Shine The Spotlight On Your Host

On chat-show interviews with celebrities or news-makers, it's all about the answers. It's all about the star on the couch. No one cares much about the interviewer.  If you are a star-creative, star-performer, CEO, artist or other best-in-class rain-maker, go ahead and ignore the interviewer and continue to make every interview all about you. If you are the one and only candidate, the interviewer will be 100% focused on luring you. That you may appear to be an egomaniac will probably not lose you the gig. Most likely, it's what they expect, from a star.

For everyone else: You are not being interviewed for a role as a star performer. You are being interviewed as a future member of a team. Far from being more important (or more interesting) than the person interviewing you, chances are, if you are successful you will end up working alongside them or more likely reporting to them.

Of course you need to show that you're the best candidate, but if you've been selected for an interview, they already believe you're capable. They know you have the right skills and abilities. They've gone through your CV. They know your experience.  You wouldn't be here if they didn't have a good sense that you could probably do the job.  No, they're interviewing you to see if you're a good fit for the team; to get a taste of what it might be like to actually have you in their face every day.

This is the number one mistake I see people making in important interviews: They make it all about them. They talk way too much. They assume that the person interviewing them wants to hire someone who is brilliantly successful, accomplished and confident.

The person interviewing you does not want to hire an egomaniac who sucks the oxygen from the room with a non-stop narcissistic rant. They want to hire someone who makes them, the boss or the rest of the team feel brilliantly successful accomplished and supported every single day. If you can't even manage to make them feel this for half an hour, you haven't got a chance.

So, instead of obsessing about what the interviewer will think of you, shift the spotlight away from your own neuroses onto how the person you're talking to feels about themselves while you are with them.

We all like to be around people who give us space to shine. If the person interviewing you feels perceptibly smarter, more accomplished and dynamic when you are with them there is a strong chance that this is an experience they will be keen to repeat. In all likelihood, they won't want you out of their sight for long.

If you can, research the person who will be interviewing you as though they, not you, was the star guest and you are interviewing them. You want to astound them with how much you know about every aspect of their professional life.   If you can't research your interviewer, forensically study the company's founders or CEO. Stun your interviewer by how well you know the company.

Prepare at least three  questions that demonstrate your understanding of who the interviewer is (their role and responsibilities) and allow them to shine as an expert about their company. Never ask a question to which you and the interviewer do not already know the answer.

Instead of trying to show how well suited you are to working for the company (an approach which could leave you seeming egocentric)  show how all the research you have done makes you uniquely appreciate what an honor it would be for you to build your career with them.  Remember, you are looking to join an existing team, not have them want to join you!

Your job in the interview is to appreciate uniquely.  Ultimately, it's not about them thinking you are a star, or even an expert. It's about them feeling stronger, better and more valued when YOU are in their company.",
"Last Sunday, comedian actress Julia Louis-Dreyfus, largely known for her work on Seinfeld and Veep, won the Mark Twain Prize, considered the highest honor in comedy. Louis-Dreyfus is the sixth woman to win the award in a male-dominated field. She is also 57, an age at which―especially in entertainment―many actresses are disqualified.

All the way back in the late 1980s, Julia Louis-Dreyfus was a casting afterthought. The Seinfeld executives decided last-minute that they needed a woman added to the cast. In popped Louis-Dreyfus, and as Jerry Seinfeld said to the New York Times, “I could not get enough of her . . . That whole time, nine years, I was not acting.”

Louis-Dreyfus is gifted comedically. But it is perhaps her conduct that makes her a distinctly unique role model. In spite of the cattiness that can define the entertainment industry, Louis-Dreyfus has made it her business to be both authentic and kind. “Many of those who spoke talked about Louis-Dreyfus’s kindness, [and] how constant and straightforward it was,” as reported in the New York Times.

In one particularly telling incident, Friends’ actress Lisa Kudrow and Louis-Dreyfus were both nominated for an Emmy. ""After Louis-Dreyfus won . . . she sent Ms. Kudrow, a fellow nominee, flowers with a note attached: 'You were robbed. -Julia.'”

It’s refreshing to see someone in any industry be so authentic and kind when the workplace today can be riddled with anything but. Especially now, at this pivotal point in time, we need more women like Louis-Dreyfus.

McKinsey & Company and Lean In just released their annual ""Women in the Workplace"" report. The numbers aren't good. While change is underway, evidenced by this report, change is also slow.

One of the first metrics the report highlights is the corporate pipeline. The percentage of women in the talent pipeline declines significantly the higher the level.

It might be easy to assume that this decline is due to attrition as women plan for families and opt out of the workplace. Historically that might have been true. But, today, the report points to hiring and promotions as the primary drivers of this decline.

While the pipeline for C-suite positions is uniformly lower for women than for men, it does vary by industry. The talent pipeline for the C-Suite ranges anywhere from 34% (Health-care systems and services) at its highest to 9% (Food and beverage distribution) at its lowest.

The next question is why? The report offers a bevy of reasons.

One particularly compelling reason was microaggressions. Based on the study, women cited microaggressions as a persistent problem, fielding them much more frequently than men. Microaggressions are cumulative. Any isolated microaggression, such as the examples below, may not appear to be disruptive, but accumulated over time, can be quite damaging.

The report offers suggestions for cultural improvement: ""Ensure that hiring and promotions are fair"" or ""make senior leaders and managers champions of diversity."" Those, however, are paper solutions, corporate cliches, not ones that can be implemented quickly in practice.

This leads us to wonder whether there's anything that women can do today rather than wait for sluggish organizational change.

One strategy women have adopted in the past to try to offset inequality in the workplace is to conform to a masculine archetype. Dress like men, behave like men, or, better yet, be nondescript not to betray the fact that, shh, you are not a man. Anyone who has tried this strategy knows just how suffocating and inauthentic it can feel.

Another strategy, which has also carried over from an earlier time, is to treat other women like the competition. The big problem with women in the workplace is that they are not a unified entity. By choice. The chances of women succeeding in this fashion are about as likely as winning with a soccer team whose players think their teammates are the competition.

When it comes to women in the workplace, the two changes I'd like to see is a culture that welcomes authenticity and one where women embrace reciprocal success. I know I respect a CEO like Ellevest's, Sallie Krawcheck, who is indisputably and authentically herself, more than any robotic, buttoned-up, non-descript CEO.

Those two changes are within reach. I suspect when deployed conjunctly, only then will we see the results we’re looking for. Or as Sallie Krawcheck put it, “There’s a lot of money to be made in taking women seriously.”

What I Learned From The Financial Crisis Of 2008",
"U.S. unemployment recently fell to 3.7 percent, the lowest rate in nearly 50 years. Record-low unemployment is beneficial to job seekers looking for their next opportunities, but makes the hiring market more competitive than ever before for employers.

Most top talent is already gainfully employed, meaning job seekers today can be more selective when it comes to finding and accepting new positions. So how can your business stand out from the competition and build a great team at a time of record-low unemployment? It's critical to be more strategic about your hiring efforts and have a continuous hiring plan in place. Here are some tips to get started.

Just as your team likely develops a product roadmap and outlines measurable goals for each month, quarter or year, it's also important to develop a recruitment roadmap with specific goals and milestones. For example, if your company plans for 50 percent revenue growth year-over-year, you should plan out how many sales, customer service and other hires you'll need to make across teams to keep up with this growth.

Include projected employee headcount growth in your overall company budget, and make sure your HR and recruiting team understand what it will take to reach these goals. By having a plan in place instead of scrambling to open roles one by one as your company grows, you can ensure you have plenty of time to follow a strategic hiring process, instead of hiring the first somewhat qualified candidate who applies.

A key piece of any recruitment roadmap is a repository of compelling job descriptions. Particularly for roles you know you'll fill multiple times throughout the year, job descriptions should be easy to access, update and post as needed - rather than starting from scratch each time you have an open role.

Beyond simply listing the job overview and responsibilities, to attract top talent, your job description needs to answer the ""What's in it for me?"" question for candidates. As most of today's job seekers are already employed, you need to embrace job descriptions as an opportunity to sell candidates on joining your team. Your job descriptions should highlight key benefits such as 401(k), health care, discounts on community events, business partnerships (including gym membership discounts and technology discounts), professional development (paid training or other certifications employees for employees), career paths and what type of commitment you make to work-life balance.

Not only does your team need a list of compelling job descriptions, but a strong career site is also key for highlighting your employment brand and attracting top talent. My company recently refreshed our culture video, which is posted on our career site so prospective applicants can see firsthand employee testimonials about what it would be like to join the team. Over the years, our previous culture video was one of the top drivers of applicants, and we're excited to see the results the new video will drive.

Other than creating a culture video, your career site should highlight the same benefits outlined in your job descriptions, as well as an overview of career sites so job seekers can imagine their growth on your team.

Once you have a recruitment roadmap, list of compelling job descriptions and strong career site, your team should have a strategy in place to always be hiring. The record-low unemployment doesn't mean employees aren't continuing to look at jobs. In fact, up to 72 percent of U.S. adults keep their eyes on open roles, no matter their employment status. This means you should always have open roles posted on your career site, even if you don't have an immediate hiring need

Based on your recruitment roadmap, if there are particular roles you know you'll need to fill several times throughout the year -- either due to projected growth or roles with high turnover -- consider keeping these roles open at all times.

Low unemployment means it might take longer than expected to secure the right candidates, so it's best to be proactive about your hiring efforts. And you'll have the chance to capture passive candidates, who track open roles even when they're gainfully employed. If the right candidates come along, you might even end up hiring them sooner than expected, or risk losing them to other job opportunities.

Businesses across industries are struggling to staff up in today's applicant-driven economy, in which teams have more open roles than available job seekers to fill them. By following these tips, you can get ahead with your hiring instead of rushing to fill open roles as they arise.",
"""Rogue actors and even governments have taken advantage of user trust to deepen divisions, incite violence, and even undermine our shared sense of what is true and what is false,"" Cook said from the stage. ""This crisis is real. It is not imagined, or exaggerated, or crazy.""

Later, he added: ""Platforms and algorithms that promised to improve our lives can actually magnify our worst human tendencies.""

Europe's General Data Protection Regulation​ (GDPR) law, which came into effect in Spring 2018, requires compliance for all organizations, regardless of size, that collects data on European citizens. GDPR fines can be up to 4 percent of an organization's global revenue.

Everyone wants to keep their personal data out of the public sphere. But what would GDPR-like legislation cost your business?

In the four months since the GDPR became law, several sources have estimated the costs of compliance for European businesses. A 300 CEO survey from Help Net Security found that GDPR compliance for small businesses (with less than nine employees) has cost less than $50,000. For larger organizations (1,000-plus employees) compliance is estimated to cost over $50,000. So if you are a small business selling to Europe these costs must be accounted for. If Cook gets his way, then these costs could hit American ventures selling within the US.

According to a report from SIA Partners, firms set aside £300-£450 ($350-$550 in American dollars) per employee on average to implement the GDPR. That report calculates that on average the cost of implementation is 30-80 times the cost of non-implementation.

PwC polled 300 senior executives at American, British, and Japanese companies with European presences. It found that among companies with finalized preparations, 88 percent reported spending more than $1 million on GDPR preparations. 40 percent reported spending more than $10 million. The pattern of increased spending was consistent regardless of company size.

Based on how these sources calculated these costs (and what they included), I see no reason to expect the cost for American business to substantially different.

With data breaches becoming more and more common, it's unlikely that U.S. lawmakers will stay uninvolved--but there's no clear timeline. Perhaps data privacy will become a hot topic for the 2020 elections. Perhaps not.

The state of California recently passed the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which comes into effect in 2020. It shares a lot of the same protections as the GDPR. Will other states follow California? Perhaps. Perhaps not.

No matter when it happens, the question will be: How much regulation is enough? Many pundits see regulation as a deterrent to innovation, a concept Cook rejected wholeheartedly. ""This notion isn't just wrong, it's destructive,"" he said. ""Technology's potential is and always must be rooted in the faith people have in it.""",
"If it weren't for immigrant entrepreneurs, many of America's most valuable startups--names like Uber, WeWork, and SpaceX--would not exist.

More than half of the privately held U.S. companies founded over the past two decades with a valuation of at least $1 billion were started by at least one immigrant entrepreneur, according to a new report from the National Foundation for American Policy, a nonprofit, nonpartisan research organization based in Arlington, Virginia. Of the 91 billion-dollar, venture-backed businesses the group studied, 50 have a founder originally from outside the United States.

""The research shows the increasing importance of immigrants in cutting-edge companies and the U.S. economy at a time when government policies are directed toward restricting all forms of immigration into the U.S.,"" said Stuart Anderson, executive director of the NFAP, in a statement. The Trump administration scrapped an Obama-era rule that would have made it easier for entrepreneurs to move to the U.S to launch businesses, while requirements for H-1B visas, granted to highly skilled foreign workers, have tightened.

""Each founder in a successful startup makes a special contribution, which means none of these companies would likely have been created or be in the U.S. if the foreign-born founder had not been allowed to come to America,"" Anderson said.

The 50 immigrant-founded unicorn startups have a combined value of $248 billion, according to the report, and have created an average of 1,200 jobs each. Several of them are also among the most valuable private companies in the nation, according to PitchBook's latest data. Uber, co-founded by Canadian Garrett Camp, has the highest valuation of any VC-backed company in the U.S., at $72 billion. SpaceX, which is valued at $24.7 billion and was founded by South African-born Elon Musk, is third on that list. In all, six of the 10 most valuable startups in the U.S. have an immigrant founder.

According to the NFAP report, more than 80 percent of the unicorn startups in the U.S. have an immigrant employee in a key position responsible for the company's growth and innovation, including roles such as CEO, chief technology officer, or vice president of engineering. Further, 20 of the 91 startup unicorns have a founder who first came to the U.S. as a student (as Musk did), while three of the immigrant founders came to the country as refugees.",
"Reducing stress is a common theme in many of the approaches to happiness. (It's hard to be content when you're anxious or feel under pressure.

Yet oddly enough, one great way to be happy is to consciously put stress and pressure on yourself.

According to research published in the Journal of Happiness Studies, people who work hard at improving a skill or an ability definitely experience stress in the moment... but also feel greater happiness on a daily basis -- and over the long term.

'No pain, no gain' is the rule when it comes to gaining happiness from increasing our competence at something. People often give up their goals because they are stressful, but we found that there is benefit at the end of the day from learning to do something well. And what's striking is that you don't have to reach your goal to see the benefits to your happiness and well-being.

Working to master a new skill or accomplish a huge goal definitely means more stress now.. But it also means more happiness later.

If you are willing to push through a bit of added stress in the short term, you can experience huge gains in happiness over the long term.

The research proves that point, but the premise also makes intuitive sense. Trying new things is stressful. Learning new things is stressful. Working towards a huge goal is stressful. It's hard.

And that's why, as I explain in my book, The Motivation Myth: How High Achievers Really Set Themselves Up to Win, many incredibly successful people set a huge goal... and then focus all their attention on the process necessary to achieve that goal.

Then, once you have a process in place, put all your focus on what your process says you need to do today.

That's how you improve. But that's also how you find additional motivation -- and additional happiness.

When you accomplish what you need to do today, you feel good about it. You did what you set out to do.

And of course that sense of accomplishment gives you the motivation you need to do what you need to do when tomorrow comes: Because success, even tiny, incremental success, is the best motivational tool of all.

When you savor the small victories, you get to feel good about yourself every day, because you no longer feel compelled to compare the distance between where you are and where you hope to someday be. And you don't have to wait for ""someday"" to feel good about yourself -- if you did what you planned to do today, you win.

Every day you will get to feel good about yourself. Even if you never quite achieve everything you set out to achieve, you'll be happier.

""People who engage in behaviors that increase competency, for example at work, school or the gym, experience decreased happiness in the moment, lower levels of enjoyment and higher levels of momentary stress. Despite the negative effects felt on an hourly basis, participants reported that these same activities made them feel happy and satisfied when they looked back on their day as a whole. This surprising find suggests that in the process of becoming proficient at something, individuals may need to endure temporary stress to reap the happiness benefits associated with increased competency.",
"As Antoine de Saint-Exupéry once said, “A goal without a plan is just a wish.”

We can’t expect to end up where we want to be if we don’t set a plan for getting there. But what if our plans go awry? What if we don’t know what’s next? And given the rapid pace of change and the inherent messiness of life, is it even possible to have a five-year plan anymore?

To tackle these questions, I talked to two successful women leaders about their approach to planning to get two different (and equally valid) routes to getting what you want in your career.

Know Where You’re Going

Shellye Archambeau has achieved exactly what she wanted in her career. She was the CEO of a tech company in Silicon Valley for over 15 years and currently sits on the board at Verizon and Nordstrom. But she didn’t get where she is today by accident. She planned it that way.

In fact, Archambeau has always been a planner. “As a young woman of color growing up in the 60s and 70s, I never believed that the odds were in my favor to get what I wanted out of life,” she explains. “I always thought that if I did ‘what everybody does,’ then the result would be the result that everybody has. And when I looked up, there wasn’t anybody running companies back then that looked like me. So I thought, I can’t do what everybody does. I have to figure out what I need to do to actually increase the odds that I can get what I want out of life.”

After realizing that she wanted to one day run a company, Archambeau knew that she needed “real credentials” and that she would increase her opportunities by going into a growing industry. So she attended Wharton, one of the top business schools in the country, and studied technology, joining IBM after finishing school before eventually becoming CEO of MetricStream.

“The first step in setting any plan is figuring out what is the goal,” Archambeau advises. “Because if you don’t care where you’re going, the plan doesn’t matter because any step is a good step.” Next, she says, ask yourself: What has to be true for me to achieve that goal? (For example, Archambeau started at IBM in sales because she learned that every CEO of the company had started out there too.) Once you’ve done your research, you can then put in place the steps that are needed to actually make those things true in order to achieve your goal.

And there are plenty of ways in which to make something true.

“Which is why it's not a matter of creating this rigid plan of like, do this step, do this step, no matter what,” says Archambeau. “And things will happen! There will be roadblocks, things will happen that'll cause you to change and that's okay. You have to be open to that.”

But when you do hit roadblocks? “Adjust the plan, not the goal,” she says.

Kristin Lemkau is at the top of her field, serving as the Chief Marketing Officer of JPMorgan Chase. But did she always know where she wanted to end up? “No. Way,” she says plainly.

After first considering becoming a writer, Lemkau flowed through her career, never setting a plan for herself but instead focusing on continuously doing good work to build advocates.

“It’s not a bad thing to not know what’s going to happen next,” she argues. And in fact, a focused plan can actually hurt your career potential by limiting your options.

“One of the mistakes that I’ve seen people make is they get set on their boss’s job or their boss’s boss’s job, and that’s great but it’s often because that’s what they can see,” she says. “They narrow their options when they do that and they end up often being disappointed either because the path is nontraditional or because they’re only piping to one option instead of multiple options by trying different things.”

Instead, Lemkau says to be clear about your ambitions, but stay flexible about the path to them.

“Just do good work,” she adds. “It’s important to be prepared and have a lot of people who are fans of your work. Because that’s often how it happens. Work really really hard, be the person everyone wants in the room, be the person who runs to the work because then you’ll have a food fight of people who will want you to be on their team.”

Lemkau also acknowledges that it was these “fans” of her work that helped her advance. “I was always pushed out of my comfort zone quicker than I was ready for,” she says.

“So many of us—I’ve done this—go, ‘I’m not ready for that, I don’t have enough skills for that, I can’t handle one more thing to do because my time is full.’ So be open if somebody has enough faith in you to ask you to move forward even if you’re not ready.”",
"Every business owner has probably run into this situation: Their own company now needs a service or skill set which no one there currently has. That's when you may need to consider a vendor. Whether you need a remote freelancer or a tech-savvy computer specialist, it can be well worth it to find an outside expert who can help rather than focusing company energy on a project outside of your employees' skill sets.

Choosing local experts can be an excellent move because you can speak with candidates in person. Hiring locally could also bolster the bond between company and community and lead to other opportunities in the future.

With so many industry experts in Chicago, it may be a bit difficult to know which ones to choose. How do industry leaders select the experts that they take on board? We asked members of Forbes Chicago Business Council to share their best advice for selecting local vendors you can trust.

The absolute best way to find a great local vendor you can trust is to talk to other business owners and find out who they are using. Think of it as going out and finding your own referral. I recommend joining a local chapter of a national association or attending networking events. Many of the greatest partnerships can begin with a recommendation from a peer. - Michael Krasman, UrbanBound

We're in the hub of SaaS companies here in Chicago, so we can take a local approach to big ideas. When we hunt for new technologies, we hit up G2Crowd (Chicago-based) first and then browse for solutions that have a local presence and are start-ups or SMBs themselves. These smaller solutions often go out of their way to service their customers and many times will develop custom solutions. - Ronny Sage, ShoppingGives

3. Ask Around And You Shall Receive

As a Chicagoan, I've come to learn and love that our city is one of collaboration and connections. This is especially helpful when I'm running my agency and I need a new vendor or provider. I have an arsenal of great contacts I can go to and ask. And because there's trust among us, I can trust who they point me to. Word of mouth has yet to fail me — knock on wood — and I'm always happy to pay it forward. - Catherine Merritt, Spool Marketing and Communications

Do your homework and embrace the internet. Don't just use some person you know. Get solid referrals from trusted business peers and if you're not getting the answers you're looking for, go online. There are tons of resources for virtual partners. - Jaisen Freeman, Phusion Projects LLC

The best way to find trustworthy local vendors is to work your local network for recommendations. Talk to bankers, insurance brokers, and lawyers, and make use of networking clubs. Find people that like their suppliers and get a recommendation. - Jeffrey Wissink, Navint Partners

Even for specialty industries (like legal), there are review sites that specialize in those industries. Look for reviews from business owners in a similar situation to you. Don’t be afraid to ask for references. If you’re going to sign a big contract, consider asking the vendor to connect you with another business who can vouch for the quality of their work. - Chris Campbell, ReviewTrackers",
"Recently I was part of a small round-table discussion held by a Long Island business newspaper. The other women at the discussion were executives from well-known accounting firms and a local PR company and two reporters from the newspaper. The topic of discussion was gender parity, which segued into a discussion about the relevance of #MeToo and its effects on the workplace, positive and negative. We were split.

Those who felt #MeToo has had negative consequences experienced a new hesitance in relationships between men and women in the workplace. I admit I have noticed this as well. They looked at this as a negative, sharing that some of their male colleagues are much more cautious about discussing certain issues, speaking casually and joking with their female colleagues. Back in April, famed life coach Tony Robbins was recorded stating that the #MeToo movement was used by women “to gain significance” and that several of his male clients have told him that they will not hire attractive women for fear of what could be.

Those who looked at #MeToo as a positive felt that it has opened a long-silenced discussion.

Both points are valid and have led to valuable, compelling and formidable examinations of our conduct in the workplace. This has been cautionary for both men and women and has added a new set of rules. This is not just about bad behavior between men and women, but also among women and among men. This is about creating a new set of rules in the workplace that covers bullying, intimidation and hostile actions that make someone feel uncomfortable and not part of the team. We have all seen this at work. What can be done to make the workplace more equitable and secure, a place where all feel safe coming to work? It is about changing the dialogue. Here are four collaborative ways to change your dialogue at work:

Raise awareness of relevant issues to all genders, inspiring open discussions.

Don’t be afraid to discuss uncomfortable issues. Discussing the hard issues in an open, judgment-free setting allows employees to air their differences, find solutions collaboratively and learn to negotiate and compromise.

Engage men in the conversation about women’s leadership parity.

Keep in mind that parity is not just a women’s issue; it’s a business issue. Businesses that have more women leaders have more financial success. One key to successful parity is integrating comprehensive conversations with men and women, identifying jointly a strategy to raise women to positions of leadership. A workplace needs to embrace equality, treating all employees in the same way, and equity, giving all employees the opportunity and tools to succeed according to their individual needs.

Our collective memories form our mindsets, attitudes and approaches that can hinder confidence and keep us from growing. Create an environment that fosters shedding limiting beliefs, discovering new skills and encouraging personal as well as professional development.

See something, say something.

It is no longer acceptable to stay silent or joke about harassment at work. If you see someone wronged by inappropriate behavior, no matter what your relationship is with the offender, it is your obligation to speak up.

Whatever your opinion is on #MeToo, the movement has brought to light the need for open discussion and creating a new set of rules in workplace behavior. This can only be done if all genders stand for equality and equity in the workplace and understand how to change the dialogue together.",
"The philosopher Descartes famously wrote: “I think, therefore I am.” Shakespeare’s famous line “to be, or not to be” is quoted regularly more than 400 years after it was written. Decades ago, Oingo Boingo released the song “Who Do You Want to Be Today,” which featured the question “do you want to be just like someone on TV?”

For many today, the question might be more like, “Who do you want to be on Instagram?” While gaining followers on social media is a common goal, in my opinion, it doesn't help you achieve your life and business goals. Leaders can draw inspiration from others, but leaders are not followers, and copying someone is not leadership.

The path to shaping your leadership style is a deeply personal journey. I admire many people, from business leaders like Jeff Bezos to athletes like Roger Federer. I also draw a lot of inspiration from my 10-year-old son's fresh perspective, confidence and energy. Drawing inspiration from many sources helped shape my style of leadership, but I believe it is uniquely my own. Who you want to be is all about you, and any answer can be right as long as it leads you on the path to a fulfilling life and achieving your goals. That can mean walking away from a great career or exiting a successful business if it's no longer the right path for you. More often, it means recognizing why the path you're following isn't working so that you can reorient yourself toward something that is a better fit.

If you do it right, your goals and your definition of success won't be the same as anyone else's. In my opinion, that's what is wrong with so many self-help and success programs. This process isn't a paint-by-numbers exercise — it's not a formula. Your life, your career and your business should be an original work of art that only you can create and only you can judge.

Who do you want to be? Who are you? Before answering, take a step back and ask why the question even matters. Why not focus on what you want to achieve rather than on how you define yourself?

Decide Who You Want To Be

I believe that achievement and identity can’t be separated. So, how can you know what you want to achieve if you don’t know who you want to be? One way to gain insight into who you want to be is to ask yourself the following questions.

• Who do you admire?

• Who do you respect?

Answering these questions can identify role models whose lives can provide you with guidance relevant to your own life. I believe that guidance does not mean copying, and it definitely doesn’t mean following. Guidance resembles self-mentoring or even self-parenting. It shapes and directs what you do, but your path is uniquely your own.

Learning from and giving credit to your influencers is important and even necessary. Roger Federer, considered the greatest men’s tennis player of all time, frequently cites the influence his tennis idols, such as Australian great Rod Laver, have had on him. Elon Musk named his company Tesla after the famous inventor Nikola Tesla to show his respect for one of his heroes. But Musk isn't trying to copy Tesla. He respects what Tesla accomplished, the best parts. But he isn't trying to be Tesla.

After you’ve figured out who inspires you or has earned your admiration or respect, the next step is to understand why you chose them. Ask yourself what it is about them that you want to bring into your life. What are the specific things they do that appeal to you? Is it their success? Their style? Their morality? Their character? Their image?

Once you’ve decided which aspects of their lives you’d like to incorporate in your own, you can focus on how to make that happen. Most successful people share certain traits, such as belief in themselves, hard work, flexibility and perseverance.

Let's say you admire the innovation and management skills of Jeff Bezos, the vision and passion of Steve Jobs and the commitment to charity of Oprah Winfrey. You can take those elements from each person to create your own very personal idea of who you want to be and how you want to define success in your life and your business. That doesn't mean you need to go into technology or have a talk show — simply try to learn, through them, more about yourself and what really drives you.",
"If you think your credit score only comes in handy when applying for loans and credit cards, think again. Your credit can affect your insurance policies, including auto insurance, homeowners insurance, life insurance and more.

Insurance is necessary to protect you and your property against disaster, and good credit can help you appear less risky to insurers and save money on your policies. (Policygenius can help you compare prices for life insurance, which may also help you save money.)

Here are three ways credit affects your insurance.

Before they extend coverage to a new policyholder, insurance companies evaluate the risk factor of potential customers, looking closely at the history of the individual requesting insurance.

For example, an auto insurance company may look at your driving history, including accidents and moving violations, to determine your likelihood of filing a claim in the future.

Insurers also look at information in a consumer’s credit report to generate a credit-based insurance score, a three-digit number that helps them assess your risk level and make a decision about your coverage.

Credit-based insurance scoring is widespread in the insurance industry. FICO estimates that 95% of auto insurers and 85% of homeowners insurers use credit-based scoring models during the underwriting process in states that allow it (in some states, credit-based insurance scoring for certain insurance types is prohibited).

Unlike your normal credit score, your credit-based insurance score isn’t publicly available. To evaluate your risk factor as a policyholder, insurers check your credit report for many of the same things as traditional lenders. For instance, Progressive says it considers payment history and current available credit balances in the underwriting process.

If your credit-based insurance score is too low - especially if you have other factors counting against you - insurers could deny your policy or charge a higher premium.

Unlike credit inquiries from lenders and creditors, insurance-related inquiries do not affect your credit score.

Poor credit won’t block you from buying insurance in most cases, but it can keep you from getting the policy you want. Insurers can decline to offer you a policy if your credit or credit-based insurance score is bad enough, which means you’ll need to shop around with other providers or work on building your credit.

If you’ve filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy within the past 12 months, you may have trouble getting a life insurance policy, especially if your bankruptcy hasn’t been discharged. If it has been discharged, you will need to find an insurer that will work with you. Different insurers require different lengths of time to pass after discharge before they will work with you.

For a longer explanation of how bankruptcy can affect your ability to buy life insurance, check out our guide on that very subject.

Your insurance premium, or the amount of money your insurance policy will cost, is directly affected by your credit. The practice of using your credit to determine insurance rates has been around for years.

Generally, the better your credit, the lower your premium will be. If you have a low credit score and a lot of negative items on your credit report, you can expect your premiums to be higher.

According to Consumer Reports, single drivers with good credit scores paid $68 to $526 more per year on average than similar drivers with the highest credit scores. And if you are involved in an accident or moving violation that causes your premiums to rise, having bad credit can cause it to go up even more.

This extends to many types of insurance providers, including auto insurance, homeowners insurance and renters insurance. If you get your health insurance through your employer, your credit may not matter as much, but if you buy your own policy, your credit could play a factor in your premium.

You have the right to a free copy of your credit report when it results in a higher premium. Some states do not allow insurers to determine your premium based on your credit (California, Massachusetts and Hawaii for auto insurance and Maryland and Hawaii for homeowners insurance).

If you’re planning on buying insurance soon, check your credit report to make sure it is representing you in the best way possible. If you can wait, you may want to work on building your credit before you buy a policy.",
"There are about 10,000 jokes about trekking around the world and finally reaching the top of a mountain, where you ask, ""What is the meaning of life?""

Let me try to answer that question for you, even if I only work on the side of a mountain (above a bar).

For me, it comes down to three things. Three things that can elevate your life, career and company.

Be self-aware: Reflect. Write. Publish your ideas and listen carefully to the responses you get.

Have regular conversations with a mentor or friend.

Solicit feedback from people who work for you, and from those for whom you work. Observe your behavior and the ways that people react to you.

Be quiet often enough that you leave room to understand how you are moving through your life. Be quiet long enough that you understand what you really want before it is too late to get it.

Serve others: Here's a giant, massive, staggeringly large free tip: to navigate the path to what you want, you must serve others.

Our world is too complex to go it alone.

The only way to build strong and lasting relationships is to be there for others. There is no way to do this by simply waiting for other people to be there for you.

For those of you who are tit-for-tat obsessed and worried that you will give more than you get, let me say this: you will give more than you get.

Yes, to have an amazing and beautiful life, to create anything of value—a company, cause, or lasting achievement—you must give more than you get.

However... in return for serving others, magnificent things will happen when you least expect it. New clients will find you, instead of the other way around. A act of stunning generosity will touch your soul. Someone you love will be saved, or propelled to new heights. Doors will open, as if by magic.

Serve because it gives you joy to serve. But also serve because service brings self-awareness, too.

Reach higher: Do not settle for an average or easy life. Never rest on your laurels or accept ""pretty good"". Safe does not equal meaningful.

And—this is hugely important—surround yourself with people who are also reaching higher.

But what does it mean to reach higher?

Does it mean get an award, win praise, beat the competition, blow your own horn?

In my mind, it means have a much greater impact than you once thought possible.

Be fully alive. Inspire others through your actions. Feel in your heart and soul what it means to be alive. Minimize suffering. Live with compassion. Pay attention to the miracles around you, and make a few of your own.

Never stop learning, and never stop growing.

When you add up these three principles, it nudges you solidly in the direction of enlightened self-interest. You will be genuinely trying to help other people, while also keeping your own goals and priorities in mind. You will understand your unique talents and perspectives, and you will also know how to understand what makes other people special.

Most importantly, you will be motivated to bring out talent in others, and well as within yourself.",
"Although it would be nice, I don't think it's possible to live a life without  some form of regret. All of us have situations and moments that we wish we could have back or do over.

Personally, the regrets that seemed to hang over my head were always the ones I hadn't yet rectified or learned from. Call it divine engineering or idealism, but most mistakes, if embraced, can act as agents for rapid growth and development. For that reason, I try to live without the fear of error. You either make decisions and they work out, or you make a mistake that you can learn from.

The thought that mistakes and regrets are a necessary part of life can be a terrifying reality for most. But, they provide the one thing we all could use a little more of -- wisdom.

Wisdom is a funny thing. It either comes too early, and we don't recognize its significance, or it comes too late, and we don't have time to utilize it.

1. I wish I'd had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me.

Ware describe this as the most common regret of all. It's easy to lose our sense of self as we navigate life. From the moment starting school through retirement, many people feel pressured to adhere to the expectations of others.

If it's not the stress of pleasing others, then it's the fear of being different and taking risks that usually deter us from following our passions. Before you know it, it's too late to pursue the aspirations we set for ourselves.

""The graveyard is the richest place on earth because it is here that you will find all the hopes and dreams that were never fulfilled, the books that were never written, the songs that were never sung, the inventions that were never shared, the cures that were never discovered,...""

If your goals are important, then you have to be intentional about pursuing them. In today's world, it's too easy to lose sight of our ambitions. Especially as we try to tackle everything else that life throws at us.

2. I wish I'd had the courage to express my feelings.

For fear of offending others, most of us choose to hold back our true feelings. Although it keeps the peace, biting our tongues causes us to harbor grudges, ill-will, and resentment -- all of which can have an adverse effect on our health and wellbeing.

3. I wish that I had let myself be happier.

Wisdom comes through experience and unfortunately, mistakes. To shortcut the process, learn from other people. Ware's article was a great reminder that wisdom is all around us--if we choose to hear it.",
"There's a saying that I made up the other day in a tweet exchange with my Inc colleague Suzanne Lucas. Individuals can generate bad ideas, but it takes a committee for a real disaster.

That's exactly what happened in Idaho, when a group of teachers dressed like ethnic stereotypes for Halloween and followed that up with an impersonation of a wall at the Mexican border. It was a disaster of a decision. At least update, all 14 were on paid administrative leave.

Don't think such levels of foolishness are exclusive to that part of the country or to teachers. Corporations you would think were smart have done some of the most amazingly dumb things. The issue is generally one of how collections of people work and the dangers of groupthink.

Groupthink is the unfortunate dynamic in which people in a group follow bad decisions and fail to speak up against them. Others begin to support an idea that is visibly bad. Without an apparent good reason, others go along. Suddenly, the group is careening down the side of a rocky embankment.

There are multiple reasons that come down to social dynamics. One is that few people want to feel as though they are on the outside of a group. Psychology experiments have shown that a sizable percentage of people will choose a wrong answer to a question because they are uncomfortable sticking out.

And what are group decisions if not the answer to a question that multiple people agree on? That is why individuals have bad ideas and committees create disasters. In organizations, a course of action is frequently the product of group agreement. It might be that the pressure comes from everyone else in the group. Or the result it might owe to a leader, like a supervisor or boss, strongly supporting something and people feeling vulnerable if they don't appear to agree.

Some ways to mitigate the problem

You can't completely eradicate the possibility of groupthink. The potential is baked too deeply into the average person's psyche. And the inclination to consider the opinions of others isn't a totally bad thing. Maybe you've had toe experience of someone who would never listen to other people until things went wrong and then tried to find someone to blame.

Being open to the opinions of others can be positive and help you avoid insularity. However, there are steps you can take to help lower the chance of people whirling off into space while holding to some idea that too many of them think is completely off base.",
"According to research conducted by Statistica in 2016, 72% of consumers in US believe their eating habit is important to good  health and long life. Health and wellness is also a key factor driving change in consumer demands in the food industry, as described in this Forbes article.

As more people seek to understand the importance of food to overall well-being, curiosity on gut health appears to be on the rise. As reflected by web queries for”gut health”, “bloating”,  “best food for gut health” and “best food for bloating”, the subject of gut health and nutrition is gaining attention.

Work done by leading scientists in the field of microbiome highlights the  importance of  gut health to overall health. I reached out to experts and industry leaders to get their perspective on this trending topic

""Gut health is essential for human health.  We have trillions of bacteria living in our intestines, and collectively they're known as the gut microbiome.  Gut bacteria can break down food your body can't digest, produce important nutrients, influence the development and function of the immune system, protect you against harmful germs, and so much more.  Gut bacteria are affected by a variety of environmental exposures, but the food we eat is emerging as one of the most influential factors.  In eating to cultivate a healthy, diverse gut microbiome, focus on getting lots of fiber, which is found in a variety of plant foods.  Gut bacteria ferment the fiber to produce beneficial compounds.  People eating high fiber diets have an increase in ""good"" bacteria and an overall increase in microbiome diversity.  Another nutrition tip- eat lots of ""fresh"" foods.  The less a food is processed, the more of it gets safely through the gastrointestinal tract and right to the bugs inside you.  Foods that are less processed have more of the important fiber that you want to feed your gut bugs.  For example, raw, steamed or sauteed vegetables are better than fried or overcooked ones.  Al dente pasta feeds the bugs better than soft pasta, and steel-cut oats are better than rolled."" - Shilpa Ravella, M.D. Assistant Professor of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, NY

""It is important to know that  people have different microbiome, hence what works for one might not work for the other. Dietary fiber that is fermentable by one person may not  be fermentable by the other and this makes personalized & data-driven nutrition very important"" . Liping Zhao PhD, Eveleigh-Fenton Chair Professor of Applied Microbiology at Rutgers University.

“Children are at greater risk of inflammatory and autoimmune conditions, such as asthma, allergies, colic and eczema, than ever. As described in a clinical study published in American Journal For Microbiology we’ve discovered that there is a short window of time to transform the gut microbiome to better fight the pathogens that are linked to these maladies.

If an infant is fed B. infantis, the critical beneficial bacteria, with breast milk during the first months of life while the microbiome is still developing, it will create a protective environment and crowd out E. coli, Clostridia, Streptococcus and other harmful bacteria that can potentially wreak havoc on the developing immune system.

There are many reasons babies start life with a deficient microbiome, however parents can rest assured that this can be restored in the first stages of life. Brand-new and expecting parents, and society as a whole need to treat deficient microbiome with a great sense of urgency ” - Tim Brown, CEO, Evolve Biosystems, Inc.

Typically, when we think about eating food, we focus on the nutritional value to our cells. We also need to feed the bacteria in our gut since they make molecules that we can’t make or only make in small amounts. Most of which functions to decrease inflammation in all areas of our body and also quiet our nervous system.

There are many studies that support a diet that includes chicken broth with plenty of fruits and vegetables is beneficial across ethnic groups – reducing risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer and inflammatory diseases involving our joints (arthritis) and gut (IBS). I find it interesting that across the globe when someone feels ill, we turn to chicken soup/broth (the old fashion kind – slow cooking the whole bird, bones included) to restore their health. Even my daughter after surgery to remove her appendix, chose chicken broth over all the other choices. Each individual will have certain foods that actually improve their gut health by feeding the good bacteria, while the same foods eaten by another individual (even in a sibling) might actually make the person feel sick if he/she is not able to breakdown the foods to provide nutrition to the body and the gut bacteria. Personalized nutrition should be a foundation of our healthcare system since the foods we eat can inhibit inflammation, and thus prevent progression of major diseases involving inflammation, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, neurological diseases, arthritis and irritable bowel disease. As Hippocrates, the father of western medicine proclaimed, let food be thy medicine. - Paul Durham PhD, Distinguished Professor and Director at Center For Biomedical & Life Sciences,  Missouri State University.

5. Nutrition Can Be Tailored To Meet A Goal

""The most important question to ask when evaluating personalized nutrition as it relates to microbiome is: ‘What is the starting diet and what is the desired endpoint’? If the goal is ‘weight loss’, then a high fiber diet seems to optimize weight loss among certain microbiome types (Prevotella dominant), but in other types (Bacteroides dominant), subjects have better metabolic markers by increasing the relative abundance of Bifidobacteria through specific prebiotics.

Remember that just because something might not work for ‘weight loss’ does not mean it’s ‘bad’ or ‘useless’. For example, a diet rich in plant compounds and fiber is high in microbiota-accessible carbohydrates, which across the board are beneficial for producing key metabolites, attenuating inflammation, and literally providing energy to human intestinal cells .

In some instances, simply having higher diversity is believed to be healthy.  In the largest observational study of its kind (Human Microbiome Project II), we see that a more diverse plant-based diet makes for a more bacterially diverse gut. Specifically, those who consumed more than 30 different types of plant each week had much more diverse microbiomes than those who consumed only 10 or fewer types of plant weekly.

"What if all the time-management articles that promise us greater productivity (wonderful and well-intentioned as they may be) are missing the point? What if these articles are going on assumptions that we haven't fully thought through? What if all this talk about time is distracting us from the real issue, which is energy?

Energy, not time, is the fundamental currency of peak performance and value creation

Earlier in my career, I was focused on time management, but eventually it occurred to me that it didn't matter how well my team and I managed our time if we didn't have enough energy. I realized that without enough energy, we would become slaves to time rather than making time work for us.

As entrepreneurs, we've all had the experience of putting in 16-hour days with barely a break for lunch but still going to bed knowing we didn't create much value. On the other hand, we've all also had the experience of working four hours and knowing we've created more value in this short amount of time than we often do after working three times this much.

What makes the difference? The difference, of course, is energy -- physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual energy. Energy, not time, is the fundamental currency of value creation, which means we need to start thinking about how we optimize our energy rather than how we manage our time.

Energy optimization, unlike time management, is a cyclical process, not a linear one. Time is finite (everybody gets the same 24 hours in a day), but energy is renewable. Energy is like currency--after you've spent your money, you need to replenish your supply before you spend again (and everybody knows that when you spend without sufficient funds to cover your purchases that you wind up in trouble).

Sprints vs. marathons and humans vs. machines

Recently, I read an article that cited a scientific study reporting that taking Wednesdays off was a great way to recharge. Evolutionary biology tells us that human beings are made for ""sprinting"" (short, intense, cyclical bursts of energy output) rather than for ""marathons"" (long, linear, sustained periods of energy output). Since the modern five-day workweek isn't exactly a sprint, taking Wednesdays off did wonders for most people in helping them feel less like they were running a marathon.

Sure, we can run marathons, but only rarely. Only machines can ""run marathons"" every day. The irony is that to the very degree we expect ourselves to perform like machines and run regular marathons, the poorer our performance will be and the less value we will create. (And we have it on good authority that this is the case.)

So if you want to enhance your performance, does that mean you need to take Wednesdays off? Maybe. It might be a great place to start if you have the option, but the real issue is starting to better understand the particular conditions that optimize your individual energy flow. This way, you can strategically harness it to power higher performance and greater value creation.

It should go without saying that everybody's different. One person's ""Wednesday"" might be another person's Monday. While I'm often at my most innovative amid the buzz of active collaboration, others on my team are most likely to be struck by inspiration when they're quietly working from home. Some people are night owls who can crank out their most dynamic work after midnight. Some are morning larks who have their best work cooking at 5 a.m.

The point is, we all have our own natural energy flow that doesn't necessarily conform to someone else's schedule. When it comes to optimizing this energy, you literally want to ""go with the flow"" rather than fighting against it. At Zen Media, we have a culture that puts a premium on optimizing our team members' energy flows. We've found that the more we each have the freedom and flexibility to organize our time as guided by these flows (rather than trying to make these flows conform to set times), the more value we create, individually and as a team.",productivity
"High school seniors across the country are beginning to feel the pressure of impending college deadlines. Although the application deadline of most U.S. colleges and universities is January 1, the ‘early round’ of admissions ends on November 1 (or sometimes 15th). At my college consultancy, we encourage all of the students we work with to apply to an early decision school and a few early action schools. I’ve found that many students have misconceptions about the early decision process based on things they read online or heard from their peers and even guidance counselors. Here are the five worst myths and misconceptions I’ve come across:

Myth 1: Early decision and early action are basically the same.

Early decision and early action sound pretty similar, and they do both mean that you apply early to a school, but getting accepted via these two routes holds vastly different implications. Early decision is binding: should you get accepted to your ED school, that is where you will spend your next four years. It means when you apply ED you should have absolute certainty that the school is your dream school and you are 100% certain you want to attend. Its binding nature means early decision is more of a boost—schools want to protect their yield rate, and an easy way to do that is by admitting more students in the ED round. Early action, in contrast, is non-binding, and should you get accepted you can still consider your other college options. Unfortunately, because it’s non-binding, it has far less of an impact on your admissions chances.

Myth 2: I can break my early decision agreement and go to a different school.

This misconception usually comes directly from the students’ misunderstanding of the agreement they sign in order to apply ED. The general thinking is, “They can’t force me to go, so what’s the worst that can happen?” This is absolutely the wrong thinking — breaking your ED agreement is not only unethical and unfair to your peers, but also an excellent way to torpedo your chances at any other school. Yes, your ED school can’t force you to attend — but you can’t go to a different school instead. When (not if) any other school finds out, either through the Common App or from your guidance counselor, they will rescind your acceptance.

Myth 3: They accept me before I get my fall grades, so my senior grades don’t matter.

This is another misconception based on a simplified understanding of the early decision process. Yes, many high schools don’t report senior grades in time for colleges making decisions in the early round — but many do or send mid-year reports that you may not be aware of. Moreover, if your grades slip too badly, or if you drop all your AP classes in favor of easier ones, it’s entirely possible that your acceptance will get rescinded.

Don’t get me wrong — you should only apply to a school early decision if it is one of your top choices and you would be absolutely thrilled to attend. But many students, especially international students, step onto campus for the first time at the beginning of their freshman year and have amazing experiences. College is what you make of it, so no campus tour is ever going to give you a full picture of what your experience would be like. Nowadays, there are plenty of online resources that will give you as much of a sense of a school as visiting it. You can look through the school’s hashtag on Instagram and Twitter, watch YouTube videos made by current students, and even go on virtual tours using a website like www.campusreel.org.

Myth 5: I shouldn’t apply early decision if I need financial aid.

In my view, this is the most pervasive and most damaging myth about the early decision process. Because students only learn their financial aid package after being accepted, many students understandably avoid committing to a school that they may not be able to afford. However, most colleges have extremely detailed calculators on their websites that can predict your EFC (expected family contribution) with startling accuracy — and if what you get after applying ED is significantly different from this calculation, you will be able to back out of the ED agreement.

Early decision isn’t for everyone, but for most students, the potential benefit of increased admissions chances outweighs the potential negative of regretting your school choice. Being completely done with the college process by around December 15th has emotional and mental benefits that can’t be overstated. The best way to avoid regret, not just in ED but in life, is to be completely sure of your decision, so think carefully before applying to a school early decision, and make sure that you aren’t basing your decisions on misinformation.",
"The Foundation for Economic Education (FEE) is a non-political, non-profit, tax-exempt educational foundation established in 1946 to promote “sound economic principles and the entrepreneurial spirit.” Recently, FEE published a list of 12 key concepts, or principles, behind their thinking. Many people argue you can't bring ""macro"" (economic) and ""micro"" (career) perspectives together. However, this article shows that you can, and that FEE principles and career ownership are largely complementary to one another.

What follows states each of the FEE principles one through 12 in turn, and provides a response on your behalf as a career owner.

1. Gains from trade: In any economic exchange, freely chosen, both parties benefit—at least in their own minds.

It’s nice to see the term “in their own minds” included above, in contrast to the popular economic (and frequently legal) insistence to use monetary values. From a career ownership perspective what goes on inside your mind is fundamental!

2. Subjective value: The value of any good or service is determined by the individual human mind.

This is also fundamental to career ownership. You come from a different place and have experienced life differently than any other working person. Your career is yours to own, and it’s up to you to express your individual preferences on how to go about that.

3. Opportunity cost: Nothing is free, and the cost of anything is what you give up to get it.

Absolutely! From the standpoint of your career, this ties in nicely with principles 1 and 2, on freedom to trade and the subjective value of what you receive.

4. Spontaneous order: Society emerges not from top-down intention or planning but from individuals’ actions that result in unplanned outcomes for the whole.

This appeals to the career owner too. But pitch spontaneous order to large corporations and the army of consultants that work for them, and you’re likely to hear a different message! It may also be a message seeking to constrain spontaneity, for example through non-compete agreements.

5. Incentives: Individuals act to maximize their own reward.

Nicely put, although be mindful this ties in with principle 2 about subjective value. That is, you’d like your employer to deliver what you want – in terms of your values, learning, flexibility, family, location, opportunity and so on – beyond any objective rewards of income or promotion.

6. Comparative advantage: Cooperation between individuals creates value when a seller can produce a given item or service at a lower cost than the buyer would spend to produce it himself.

It’s nice to see buyers and sellers viewed as individuals, rather than just seeing a business-to-business perspective. However, beware viewing the cost in monetary terms. As principle 3 asserts, your comparative advantage reflects what you would otherwise need to give up – in terms of alternative uses of the time saved, the freedom available, the learning prospects, and so on.

7. Knowledge problem: No one person or group knows enough to plan (and force) social outcomes, because information necessary for social order is distributed among its members and revealed only in human choice.

This complements the sensemaking and networking approaches covered in earlier articles, both of which point to how you can seek out, exchange and apply knowledge in your career. Remember to consider how you can grow your network, including bridging “structural holes” to add greater value.

8. Seen and unseen: In addition to the tangible and quantifiable effects, there are quite often invisible costs and unmet opportunities to any action or policy.

Most career owners who are successful on their own terms already get this. Everything has an upside and a downside. Seeing the world through rose-colored glasses may be psychologically comforting in the short term, but it’s not the path to long-term success. Watch out, though, for your glasses being tinted by social or political reference groups that surround your career.

9. Rules matter: Institutions influence the decisions individuals make. For example, property rights extend from the reality of scarcity which demands that ownership must be vested in individuals and not a collective.

This reads as if the intention is to protect individual freedom. However, in the U.S. especially, some property rights are contested. The Dakota Access Pipeline completed in 2017 was opposed by the Sioux nations originally granted sovereign land rights in the mid-1800s. Those nations argue their rights were not respected when the pipeline was approved, or in what they see as previous government transgressions.

10. Action is purposeful: Each person makes choices with the intention of improving his or her condition.

This seems fundamental. However, one choice not so far highlighted is the companionship we nurture. A career owner may be especially concerned about keeping company with others working in a similar field, through what are commonly called . Career owners also often stay in touch with former work colleagues or project members with whom they’ve interacted and learned to trust. As a result, your purposeful action can often draw on communal support.

11. Civil society: Voluntary association permits people of all backgrounds to interact peaceably, create value, cultivate personal character, and build mutual trust.

At this moment in time, career owners “of all backgrounds” are struggling deeply with this principle. Much of what is claimed to be political debate can be seen as attempts to control the media narrative, rather than buying into what's proposed here. As a career owner, you'd like to encourage your country to move toward, rather than away from, the behaviors listed. One option is to do more in reaching out from your own ethnic, gendered or religious group toward groups from other backgrounds.

12. Entrepreneurship: Acting on an opportunity to gather underused, misused, or undiscovered resources and ideas to create value for others.

Perhaps you are already practicing what can be called ? In any case, note that the language of gathering “underused, misused or undiscovered resources” can be applied to people you know, or to places, products or services you know about. Focus on the meaning of entrepreneurship provided, simply to gather resources and create value for others, and ask how you can do that in your career.

The FEE article, authored by Executive Vice President Richard Lorenc, concludes by inviting you to “think about all the ways and places these principles appear—as you shop, socialize, and plan your future” and that “economics is everywhere!” He’s right, and career owners are everywhere too. Moreover, FEE economics and career ownership principles largely support one-another. Perhaps you can do well by sticking with both?",
"When we think about what constitutes a healthy individual, we tend to focus almost exclusively on physical health — someone who eats healthy foods, exercises regularly, and avoids bad habits like smoking. Unfortunately, this perception ignores the fact that even the most physically fit individuals can suffer from debilitating mental health issues.

World Mental Health Day falls in October, so now is a good time to discuss what business leaders and entrepreneurs are doing to prioritize their mental health and that of their employees. Mental health is important for numerous reasons, including its connection to physical health, but because it can be less outwardly visible, it is often overlooked.

One in five Americans suffer from some sort of mental health condition, but more than half don’t receive treatment. Recognizing this issue 10 years ago, Congress passed the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act in order to make mental health and substance abuse treatment as accessible as care for other medical conditions. But a risk management and health care consulting company report last year found that patients continue to struggle when it comes to accessing treatment.

According to an International Foundation of Employee Benefit Plans survey, over two-thirds of employers said mental health and substance abuse issues have contributed to absenteeism and tardiness at their organizations. In addition, more than 60 percent of the survey’s respondents said these issues impact the physical health, overall job performance, focus, and productivity of their employees.

You might be wondering what you can do to encourage your employees to focus on their mental health. Consider how the following entrepreneurs and businesses leaders are making mental health a priority for their teams. After all, prioritizing mental health is not only the right thing to do ethically, but given that your employees are your biggest asset, it’s the right thing to do for your bottom line as well.

1. Elizabeth Falconer, Owner of Position by Design, Inc.

Considering her father served as the head of psychiatry at Duke University, Elizabeth Falconer probably has a keener awareness of mental health than most people. And she knows firsthand how mental health issues can impact your work. After losing her father and two grandmothers and stepping in to care for her mother as she died of pancreatic cancer — all in a span of 14 months — Falconer found herself unable to work full-time. Ultimately, her decision to take some time off made all the difference: “I needed to have my own decompression time to spend time in my garden, with my horses, and with other family members.”

Her experience and time off heightened her awareness of what others might be facing outside of the office. As a business owner, this influenced her time-off policy. She says, “I try to be more flexible with working hours when necessary and provide ‘downtime’ in times of personal crisis, without penalizing workers for taking time off.”

Marco Scognamiglio understands that mental health has long been a taboo subject, and he’s working to change that in his own company. “I strongly feel that you can’t positively impact an issue without first being brave enough to acknowledge its existence, no matter how sensitive the subject may be,” he says. Instead of tiptoeing around the subject, RAPP Worldwide focuses on ways to empower employees to prioritize mental health.

Scognamiglio explains, “Our talent is automatically enrolled, at no cost, into an employee assistance program that provides support, resources, and information pertaining to personal and work-life issues, including confidential counseling, legal support, and more — with free initial conversations or sessions with a professional.” Because hesitant employees might not take the initiative on their own, the company makes participation in the program the norm. After all, taking care of your mental health shouldn’t be something you only do when you’re in a deep depression. Counseling can help you balance work and family or combat stress during a busy week.

3. Sharon Soliday, CEO of The Hello Foundation

The Hello Foundation recognizes four core values and prioritizes these in its policies: putting kids first, giving generously, practicing work-life balance, and providing quality services. CEO Sharon Soliday says her company offers “flexible schedules, remote work, unlimited leave (including both the length and frequency of time off), and health insurance that includes mental health services and alternative care reimbursement.”

More importantly, Soliday acknowledges the importance of modeling these initiatives from the top down, saying, “If I need a break and don’t say so, how will staff feel safe to prioritize their needs?” Even the most well-intentioned mental health policies can fall short if employees don’t feel comfortable taking advantage of them. Lead by example and look for opportunities to encourage your staff to use these policies and be open with you about what’s going on outside of work. It’s as simple as being transparent with your team about times you take off to prioritize your mental health.

Joe Burton says he emphasizes recovery time with his team: “We treat our professionals like athletes. If we expect people to train and push to success, they have to take breaks and recover.” With devices constantly at hand, many people bring their work everywhere they go. They might leave the office an hour early on a Friday, but they’re checking work emails while out to dinner with their family, and the phone is buzzing off the bedside table at all hours of the night. This environment provides no opportunity for recovery.

Before founding Whil, which provides digital training for mental and emotional well-being, Burton worked as a COO of a large company, which meant 14-hour days and constant travel. He herniated two discs in his back, which led him to suffer from insomnia. After losing two siblings to drugs and suicide, he reached a crisis point and finally vowed to prioritize stress management. Now, Burton says that his company practices what it preaches: Employees are expected to take a 5- to 10-minute mental break for every 50 minutes worked, and the team holds a mindfulness practice at 3 p.m. each day. Burton explains, “Mental health is like anything else — you have to practice at it to develop the skills necessary to deal with the pace of modern living.”

At Digital Resource, Shay Berman understands that mental health is very much an individual matter. To better enable employees to look after one another’s well-being, Berman encourages them to get to know each other beyond the surface level: “At Digital Resource, we like to take extensive personality tests and read motivational books in a group setting to really discover our strengths as individuals and as a team. The knowledge taken from these practices really creates our positive culture, and we are able to use the new awareness to keep an eye out for how each individual typically reacts to unavoidable stress.”

Instead of taking on the impossible task of removing all sources of stress, Berman focuses on making sure employees are able to cope with it by leaning on each other and maintaining a healthy work-life balance. Prioritizing mental health is an ongoing process, not something you can take care of once, then check off of your to-do list.

Samia Reichel recognizes that prioritizing mental health is essential for her team to succeed: “If we are not mentally prepared for our clients, they suffer.” Fidelity’s team members start with a strong foundation in physical health, including getting plenty of sleep, exercising regularly, and paying attention to what goes into their bodies. These are priorities team members discuss regularly to ensure they’re forming healthy daily habits.

Once physical health is prioritized, the focus turns to self-management. “Everything in our business is time blocked and assigned to an employee, Reichel says. “We meet regularly to discuss what tasks we have to complete and ensure we all meet our deadlines.” She adds that if an employee is struggling, her team works to redistribute the work to ensure he or she stays on track. Finally, the company encourages taking time off regularly so team members can recharge their batteries. Take it from a financial professional — encouraging time off is more of an investment than a cost.

It might not be easy to give employees this time, especially if your business is young, and your team is small. But when it comes to policies that can make mental health issues more bearable, treat others as you would want to be treated. At the end of the day, your employees — and consequently your bottom line — will thank you.",communication
"Good things come to those who wait, or a door will open for you somewhere. Every time I hear someone tell somebody something like this, I just think—what? What world are they living in?

The whole ""good things come to those who wait"" notion is a fallacy for most of us. The truth is that what most of us experience is that doors don't just open, and good things don't just come because we wait for them. I don't presume to know that this hasn't been and is not the truth for someone, somewhere, somehow.

Maybe good things have come to some who have just waited. Maybe doors have indeed just magically opened for some. I accept that these statements might be true for the people who said them, came up with them or coined them some time ago. Maybe this was their reality, maybe it is their children's reality - but it is not mine, and it isn't the reality for any accomplished and successful people I know.

I have been asking people this question a lot lately because I am very interested in what drives people to excel, what motivates their discipline and what steps they take to realize their dreams. In all my conversations and research, what I have learned is that successful and fulfilled leaders are not waiting for anything to happen. People who are working in their dream careers are not waiting for anything to happen. Instead, they pay the price that leadership and career advancement require, and they hustle.

Here's how I see it.

Waiting for good things to happen and hoping for someone to open a door reflects a passive and undetermined path to career and leadership success, and just the thought of it leaves me feeling powerless. I read somewhere a long time ago that ""The dream is real, but the hustle is sold separately."" Boy, that is some straight truth for us all!

This is your life. This is your career. This is the best test of your leadership.

We have to step up and lead our own journeys, create our own experiences and carve our own paths. This is not a trial rehearsal, a pre-test or practice exam. This. Is. It. And how we choose to focus our energies and use our time is a choice we have to live with. Think about this. Given the seriousness of these choices,

Are you aiming to win the most patient person of the year award? If your goal is to learn patience, then wait. If you goal is to learn disappointment, then wait. If your goal is to waste time, then wait. If you goal is limited to hope - then wait.

Yes. Sometimes miracles happen. In the very rare instance, maybe a door will indeed be opened to you just out of the blue. In the very rare instance, maybe good things will come to you even when you haven't worked for them. Maybe this could happen, but only in the very rare instance. If you have the patience, go ahead and wait.

While you wait, here is what leaders and hustlers will be doing.

We will pay the price to make it happen! I agree that hope is good. I have a lot of hope and a lot of faith for a better tomorrow. But even hope and faith require action so I know we have to go out there and hustle. We have to face our fears and push through them. We have to do things we don't feel like doing. We have to demonstrate unusual levels of discipline. We have to struggle, to focus and to commit to a goal. We have to want it bad enough to make sacrifices and not be deterred by the many, many obstacles that are surely to be in our paths.

So often I get asked things like, ""What did you do to overcome obstacles; what did you do to get where you are; what did you do to (go ahead and fill in the blank)?"" My answer is not any different from what most of you have done.

I figured out where I wanted to go, and then paid the price to get there. I did that more than 20 years ago when I was beginning my education and career, and I still do this today.

Figure out what you want and then pay the price to get there.

This is the rift for most—that price.

Everything has a price, and you have to want what you want so badly that you are willing to pay the price to get it. It is not easy for anyone. Success involves making difficult choices, and leaders make these choices every single day. It involves going through some fire. It involves consequences we'd rather not experience. It involves consistency, determination, perseverance, persistence and discipline. Anything worthwhile has a price. Well actually, even not wanting or pursuing anything has a price.

But to demonstrate leadership and advance your career, you will need to pay the price. The price could be things like building a door where there is none, kicking in a door that has been closed to you, and even being willing to close some doors as well. The price is time, money, emotions, risk, courage, change, discomfort, effort, work, study, discipline, focus, etc. The price is grit, and the price is real.

If you want it bad enough, muster up all the courage and leadership you have and take that first step now.

So I ask you...",
"The time when human beings will be the primary source of differentiation in every playing field is fastly approaching. Defined as the ability to make healthy choices based on accurately identifying, understanding and managing your own feelings and those of others, emotional intelligence can be considered as a key player when unlocking human potential.

Doesn’t mind if you are a natural approaching others or not, a business manager or a computer officer, we are all people and we are all dealing with people. Working on the improvement of our emotional intelligence seems to be always the right choice. But how can you positively manage your emotions, in order to better connect and the emotions of others and engage with them so they can improve and get motivated to give their best? There are a huge amount of little tips to help you go through the corridor of self-awareness, self-management, social awareness and relationship management! Ready?

Learning how to manage your emotions is the first step in order to connect and positively influence others. Self-awareness and self-management can be strengthened through character education and modeling of positive behaviors.

Realizing that you need to work on your emotional intelligence is the cornerstone of any further action. Things do not just happen. We have to work on them.

Testing your EQ is a fun way to start. There is a huge list of free recommended tests you can try out as The Psychology Today Test, The Mindtools Emotional Intelligence Test,  The Institute for Health and Human Potential Test, The Harvard Business Review Emotional Intelligence Test, The Alpha High IQ Society Test, or The Psychtests Scientifically validated Emotional Intelligence Test.

Remember to be truthful with yourself and be prepared to get surprised by results.

The image we have from ourselves does not always correspond with reality. Asking for the opinion of people that would be honest to us despite any inconvenient feedback could help us to put our feet in the ground.

4. Choose the morning & learn to observe your emotions as an outsider.

Wake up. Take a breathe and analyze the way you are feeling in this concrete moment. Make the effort to get distant to your feelings in order to better understand why are you feeling this way. You may be sad because the weather is rainy or extremely happy because you have an exciting event coming afterward. Accept these feelings as something that happens to you but does not define or conditionate you. Choose the early morning to make this exercise. Normally is the time of the day when we are more rested and less affected by different emotions at the time.

Strong willpower is a great ally of positive emotional management. Strengthening your willpower will help you to better educate your character and control your emotions. Work on acquiring stable habits and choose one battle at the time. You can start by counting to three before answering when you are getting nervous or letting the other person finished taking before jumping in. Focus on just one goal and do not move to the next one until you are already mastering it.

Choose every day one event that you have perceived as negative and dissect it analyzing all the positive side effects that it could potentially bring to you or to others. General public transport strikes are absolutely annoying and make the logistics of your day quite complicated. But think about all these taxi drivers that will make a deserved extra profit out of it.

Devote three minutes before going to bed to go through your day analyzing your won battles and those ones that should be the ground for your next objectives. Write results down. Keeping track of the efforts will help you to take it seriously and motivate you to keep going.

Once you start to be already aware and in control of your own emotions, it is time to start working on understanding how others are feeling, and finding ways to become more empathetic.

Back to the cornerstone of every valuable change or improvement. You need to work on a real strategy of little actions that will lead you to the achievement of your objectives.

If people emotions are not your strong point but you are determined to exercise your empathy, start by meeting regularly with your closest ones. Appointing a friend to friend moment with your daughter, a romantic date with your partner, a happy after hour with your workplace colleague, or a follow-up coffee with your old friend from school will set up the easiest environment to start working on your empathy and understanding others emotions.

3. The rule of the Age- Sex- Circumstance

Analyzing the basic information of the person in from of you can already provide you with lots of useful information.

Recognizing if you are dealing with a young man arriving late to work in the middle of a traffic jam, a tired middle-aged husband after a working day, a heartbroken teenage son, a stressed bossed going through a divorce or a lonely grandpa unable to cross the street by himself requires more analytic than empathetic skills. Extracting the age, sex and visible circumstance of the person we are addressing is giving us already almost all the information we need for the “How Do I Think I Would Feel If I Would be him/her” exercise.

Listening is the “conscious processing of the auditory stimuli that have been perceived through hearing” (West & Turner, 2010). Listening thus is much more than the passive act of receiving or hearing becoming a fully active process. Start by practicing mindful listing or the art of being present in the moment and paying full attention to what is happening right now. Focus on the vis-à-vis and not on your own thoughts. Do not let your mind to start working in your own answer until you have fully listened and understood what the person in front of you is trying to tell you. Pay full attention to the name of your interlocutor in a first time formal or informal introduction. This is a is a very good exercise for beginners. We tend to be so absorbed by shaking hands and trying to make a good impression that we forgot we are actually talking to someone.

Sometimes you really do not manage to feel what the other person is feeling. Showing that you care despite you don't understand helps quite often to establish empathetic connections.

So little practiced, so easy and powerful!

"If Maya Murillo’s life was a numbers game it’d be hard to decide which numbers to focus on. At time of publishing, Murillo has 105k Instagram followers on her personal page, speaks to an audience of close to 1 million subscribers on BuzzFeed’s “Pero Like” YouTube channel, and averages 30k views on her own YouTube videos. As the numbers swim on the page, it may be easier to note this — her ever-growing presence as a Latinx content creator and comedian is a point of pride for the Latinx community.

A look through her Instagram’s comment section offers enough evidence of how relatable she is.

“I learned that the best videos are those where the host is fearless and really immerses themselves into the story,” shares Murillo. “I produced a video called “I Tried To Learn Spanish In 60 Days”, [which] was [my first] raw video [where] I was finally vocal about my experience in learning a language that is so strongly tied to my culture and means so much to me. To my surprise, it was a total success.”

For Murillo, a third generation Mexican-American, BuzzFeed’s offer to be a resident on Pero Like was synonymous with extending her platform to properly represent her lived experience as a Latinx. An experience that included her own grandmother having to come to terms with Murillo leaving home for a career opportunity that would empower her next step.

“When I told my Abuela [grandmother] I was moving, she didn’t quite believe me until day of,” explains Murillo. “I had to explain that I needed to do this for my family. I want to one day buy her and my parents a house and in order to do that, I had to go on this personal journey. I am the first one in my family to move out of Arizona. At first, it was hard to adjust but I think that with the success I’ve had so far, my family is able to see that hard work is paying off.”

Below Murillo shares how she balances creating content for BuzzFeed and for her personal brand, plus what advice she has for other Latinx creators.

Vivian Nunez: Your role in creating content like Pero Like helps shape a larger conversation on how Latinx content is defined — what do you hope is the message that is coming across to other content creators in the space?

Maya Murillo: I hope other creators see that we are not afraid to be vulnerable. We are actually very open about our experiences — the good, bad and the ugly. By being vulnerable, we are able to connect on a deeper level with our audience.

Nunez: What advice do you have for other Latinxs who want to create content that is rooted in their own identity?

Murillo: Consistency is everything. If you are not consistent on a platform you are pushed down by their algorithm. However, over-posting content is dangerous, too. You need to be authentically consistent and really care about what you’re posting. People can see right through if you’re oversharing just to post something on social media.

Nunez: What advice do you have for others who are navigating a balancing act of passions and careers?

Murillo: Silence your inner hater. As creators, we tend to think that no one cares about what we’re making or we think to ourselves, “No one is going to watch. Why should I even post this?!” I have done this way too many times and have found myself over-analyzing so much that I end up doing nothing. Creators are sensitive and we need to be nicer to ourselves. Lately, I’ve been posting things that make me happy, which has actually been working because people can truly tell that I’m not trying too hard.

Nunez: How do you see your role and impact in the Latinx space growing?

Murillo: I see myself becoming fully bilingual and sharing my journey with the world. I want to share my experience with the people who don’t feel Latino “enough” — whether that’s because they don’t speak the language or don’t have an understanding of their culture and where their families come from. I want them to know that there is always an opportunity to learn and overcome this obstacle. Our experiences are valid and we should always feel proud of our identities. It’s really up to us to begin this journey for ourselves.",
"At a time of bombs being delivered to top Democratic leaders and a mass shooting in a Jewish synagogue, “the impulse to seek partisan advantage from a tragedy,” writes legal academic and Fox commentator Alan Dershowitz, “seems as irresistible as it is irresponsible.” Yet it would be equally irresponsible if we didn’t seek to learn from these unspeakable events.

“Both parties,” argues conservative columnist, Peggy Noonan, “could absorb an essential truth of the moment.”

Democrats really and sincerely see the threat of violent words and actions as coming from the right. It’s Mr. Trump—he’s hateful and has no respect and it sets a tone. He encourages fights at his rallies; he said the other night that a congressman who pushed around a reporter was his kind of guy. He calls the press the enemy of the people. He widens all divisions, mindlessly yet opportunistically. No surprise his adversaries are being sent bombs. Republicans and the right truly, deeply see the threat as coming from the left. Rep. Maxine Waters and Sen. Cory Booker actually told crowds to get in Republicans’ faces; Hillary Clinton says you can’t treat them civilly. Republicans see the screamers and harassers at the Kavanaugh hearings, the groups swarming Republican figures when they dine in public, antifa. A man who wrote “It’s Time to Destroy Trump & Co.” on Facebook didn’t insult Rep. Steve Scalise last year; he shot and almost killed him. The intimidation is coming from the left.

Noonan is correct to point out that the shooting of Republican Rep. Steve Scalise by someone from the left is just as reprehensible as any shootings and bombing attempts from the right.

Yet the disproportion in some of her arguments is troubling.

To equate Trump’s actions, as the head of the legal system, publicly accusing Hillary Clinton of unspecified crimes more than 150 times since becoming president and inciting rallies to shout “lock her up,” on the one hand, with Hillary’s Clinton’s remark, now as a private citizen, that “you can’t treat such behavior civilly,” on the other, is an instance of false moral equivalence.

“the claim that two radically different ethical actors are really doing the same thing and that they should be judged and treated the same way. For example, if two schoolchildren are scuffling and hitting each other in the playground, a judgment of ""moral equivalence"" by the teacher may result in separating the two and (perhaps) punishing them both equally (for ""fighting"")… If one of the children in our example was a notorious school bully, and the other child was fighting back in self-defense, then it would clearly be wrong to punish them both equally.”

Is it too much of a stretch to grasp that Trump resembles the notorious school bully, while Clinton resembles the other child fighting back in self-defense?

To equate Trump’s actions, as the head of the legal system, to be calling the press, ""the enemy of the people” while making more than 5,000 false or misleading statements and threats of retaliation with any criticism of Trump’s false or misleading statements would equally appear to be an instance of false moral equivalence.

It is ironic that so many Republicans find themselves in a position of arguing for moral equivalence since it was Republicans themselves who popularized the notion of false moral equivalence. In an article called ""The Myth of Moral Equivalence"" published in 1986, Jeane Kirkpatrick, the United States ambassador to the United Nations in the Reagan administration, sharply criticized those who claimed there was ""no moral difference"" between the Soviet Union and democratic states. The U.S., she argued, was a benevolent democracy that despite flaws stood for truth and freedom, while the Soviet Union was a repressive autocracy out to subvert freedom and democracy. It was an argument that the U.S.A. and Republicans essentially won. Moral clarity was rewarded. America stood tall in the world.

Jennifer Rubin, a center-right columnist for the Washington Post, makes a valiant effort to sort out moral equivalents and differences in the current American context. “Violence” she writes:

By contrast, she writes, violence is not:

Bigotry, she writes, is “obstinate or intolerant devotion to one’s own opinions and prejudices.” Trump’s apologists say “both sides” contribute to an atmosphere of hate, bigotry, divisiveness and meanness. Yet unlike Trump, Rubin points out, Democratic leaders do not

The Quality Of Discourse Is Deteriorating

What both sides and researchers all agree: the quality of discourse is deteriorating. Attacks on Jewish people are rising on Instagram and Twitter, researchers confirm. Many but not all of the posts mention billionaire investor and philanthropist George Soros, who was among the targets in a series of attempted bombings. Soros is frequently the subject of unfounded conspiracy theories.

The debate needs to go on. ""We're facing a battle for the soul of this nation,” writes former Vice-President Joe Biden. “We will either stand against this hate now and wipe it out. Or we will rue the day we allowed it to grow and fester. Our values, our core beliefs, all that has made this nation a beacon to the world is at risk.""

"Day 1: Rethink relationships. This post is part of Forbes’ Career Challenge: Build Stronger Relationships In 15 Days.

Last week, a client of mine went to three very different events in Texas, Florida and New York. One was with people in the trucking industry, another with top minds in the legal industry and a third was with hard-charging entrepreneurs.

He told me, ""Everyone was talking about the same thing. People.""

Even at the ""technology"" event, he said, the focus was on people.

This is a critical insight if you want to advance your career.

Too many professionals move through life trying to sell something:

No one likes to be sold. No one wants to be a bank or funding source for what you want. No one wants to help in your job search and then have you forget them.

People do want connection. We want to find others whom we like and respect, and who feel the same way about us.

For example, if you are trying to ""network your way"" into a job at a leading company, are you genuinely interested in building relationships with the people you meet along the way? In many cases, job candidates treat such new connections as little more than stepping stones to what they want (i.e., a better job and more money).

This is no way to run a career.

Two-thirds or more of the business posts I see on social media can be summarized in one word: Me.

They are all about the person or company that shared the post: what they are selling, what they want, what they did.

I'd like to propose a better path through your career.

Everything you share on social media and every time you reach out to others should offer a benefit to whomever is on the receiving end.

What does this mean? Imagine that you are delivering a webinar in Chicago, and you share this news via social media. Don't just say, ""Come to my seminar."" There are a ton of people who don't live in Chicago or will be busy that day, so they can't come. Instead, offer a lesson related to your seminar, and then say, ""By the way, if you're going to be in Chicago next Tuesday, I'll be talking about this and related lessons.""

Thus, members of your network benefit even if they can't do what you want them to do.

""Serve, don't sell"" is a simple philosophy that you can memorize by the end of this article, but it takes years to deeply integrate it into your career and life. Every single day, you encounter opportunities to serve others. The more of these opportunities you embrace, the more you will build and nurture true human connections. No single one of these good deeds may result in more money or a new job for you. But collectively, they will lead to a rich and rewarding career.

""Serve, don't sell"" also works for employee engagement. It works for customer engagement. It works to power revenue growth. It works with anything and everything that includes people.

Using your unique talent and expertise in a genuine effort to help others is by far the fastest way to strengthen your relationships—and cultivate valuable new ones.

One last point: the harsher and more strident our world becomes, the more welcome it is to come across a person who is genuinely interested in helping others. Let that person be you.

"Former Congressman Chet Edwards is a guest contributor for the College Promise Campaign

As millions of Americans prepare to exercise their right to vote on Tuesday, November 6, we must never forget the men and women who have fought and sacrificed to protect that right. As a nation, it is our duty to ensure the men and women who have worn our nation’s uniform have the care and services they not only deserve, but have earned.

While serving in Congress, I was proud to represent the largest Army installation in the country, Ft. Hood, Texas, for 14 years. In 2008, in a bipartisan effort, Congress passed the Post 9/11 GI Bill to provide educational benefits for veterans, servicemembers, and their family members. These benefits can be used to cover tuition and fees, housing, books and supplies, tutorial and relocation assistance, along with testing and certification fees. Helping veterans receive a college education is not only the right thing to do for our country, it is the smart thing to do for our country. It has been estimated that for every dollar taxpayers spent on the World War II GI Bill, taxpayers received seven dollars back. Educating our veterans was a great investment then and now.

As a part of the Post 9/11 GI Bill, I was honored to work with a constituent of mine, Malia Fry on the Marine Gunnery Sergeant John David Fry Scholarship Program. This scholarship program covers the full cost of college tuition to the spouse and children of service members who die while serving on active duty in the line of duty. I first met Malia and her two children at a post office dedication ceremony in Lorena, Texas. Her husband, Marine Gunnery Sergeant John David Fry, served our country in Iraq. In the week before he was headed home to his wife and three children, all under the age of 10, with his bags already packed, he volunteered to go on one final mission to dismantle three roadside bombs in Anbar Province. As he was dismantling the final bomb, it exploded and John David Fry lost his life, while shielding the lives of two other Marines. As I met his widow and young children that day in Lorena, I thought surely our country could do more for these children and every child who has lost a parent making the ultimate sacrifice for our country. With Malia’s  determination and leadership, we were able to pass the Fry Scholarship Law in 2009 and honor her husband’s sacrifice and the sacrifice of so many who have paid the ultimate price serving our country and protecting our rights and freedoms.

Unfortunately, there are still barriers to veterans, servicemembers, and their family members in accessing their Post 9/11 GI Bill Benefits. The College Promise Campaign, Young Invincibles, and Veterans Education Success are hosting a panel discussion on the barriers to success for student Veterans on Tuesday, October 30, from 5:30-7:30pm at El Centro College, Room P705, 801 Main Street, Dallas, Texas. The panel will include Malia Fry, Representative Chris Turner (TX-101), Ashlynne Haycock, of the Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors (TAPS), Colonel Miguel Howe, of the Bush Institute Military Service Initiative, Alex Shebanow, Director of “Fail State”, Rosye Cloud, Vice President of the College Promise Campaign, and Renee Monczynski, a student Veterans and Young Adult Coordinator with TAPS. Please join us to learn more about the benefits of the GI Bill and how it can be used to serve those who have served us.",

"Hiring is one of the hardest challenges leaders will face. There's always a sense of urgency to get that vacant position filled. When you're short staffed, tasks build up, your staff start entering the burnout phase, and the company's performance takes a hit.

It's easy to succumb to the pressure and hire out of desperation, but resist the urge to settle. Picking the wrong candidate is always more detrimental to your business than not picking one at all. Otherwise, the consequences of a bad hiring decision will cost you time, money and jeopardize your culture even further.

Take a breath. You need a clear mind to be effective in choosing a high performing team member. Here are 5 strategies to help you avoid these common hiring mistakes and make the right choice the first time.

Is their charm or wit clouding your judgment and distracting you from what really matters? It's easy to be wowed by someone who shares the same interests as you, but you need to keep your focus in order to recognize any red flags.

If you are consistently off topic in the interview, it will be tough to assess your candidate against all of your criteria. How well will they fit in with the team? Are they aligned with the company's core values? Regardless of how likable they are, it is important to ask questions regarding your company, their experience and cultural fit.

2. Start asking for help.

Your employees know best what skills, knowledge, and temperament it takes to be successful within your company. When you are the only one involved in the interview process, it can be challenging finding the perfect fit for your team.

In order to start making the best decision, you need to enlist help. I always involve different levels of staff to meet with potential candidates. Just be sure to communicate clearly your expectations and criteria for the role. It's likely that they will return with valuable information you need to help make the right decision.

Hiring friends and family is always a gamble. Sometimes it works; most times it doesn't. While everyone deserves a fair shot, it's important to remember that favors should not be given out at the expense of your company.

Be open to referrals but always hold to the same hiring standard. Give each candidate an equal chance to impress you. Always remember your business is the top priority when you're considering helping someone out.

Business is booming, and it's time to hire additional staff. Naturally, your first thought is to get someone in before the pressures of deadlines start to pile up.

There's a the huge risk when you rush the process. Hiring quickly means you're not screening enough talent. After a couple months at the job, you'll soon discover one of three things: they don't have the right skills, they're a bad cultural fit, or even worse -- they're both.

To avoid this hiring disaster, take the time to define exactly what your new role looks like. Create steps and stages that candidates have to complete before you offer them that contract. This may include an initial skills test followed by multiple interviews with staff, and then pilot projects so you can gauge their working style.",
"We are approaching year-end and, not surprisingly, many investors and traders in financial markets are reviewing their 2018 performance and contemplating goals for 2019. Fewer market participants will actually review their goals from last year and carefully assess which have been reached and which have not. The sad reality is that goal-setting too often fares as well as New Year's resolutions in terms of long-term impact on behavior. Why is it that we can be so sincere and motivated in formulating goals and so bad at sustaining their pursuit? Research in psychology suggests two important factors at work:

Dr. Rose's work breaks work-related meaning into six components, which he labels CAARMA:

His research finds significantly higher engagement and retention when CAARMA scores are high versus low. Workplaces that provide a sense of meaning bring the best out of teams and team members. To the degree that we are the managers of our own lives, it is not enough to lay out good intentions in our journals. We need goals that are meaningful--and that create positive habits of meaning. We are most likely to sustain and attain our goals if we turn meaning-making into a habit, guiding our lives and also inspiring them. That is what it means to truly lead our lives.",
"Not only is Kelly Hall-Tompkins one of the top violinists in the world, she is also an amazing philanthropist and businesswoman (named by the New York Times as a “New Yorker of the Year”). She, of course, has innate qualities that have helped drive her success, but refining her mental game brought her to new levels of achievement and, most importantly, enjoyment. Like many top performers, Kelly had “perfectionist” tendencies that helped contribute to her success to a certain point, but were also accompanied by damaging consequences.

“Perfectionists” have a tendency to quickly brush off successes while focusing more on their shortcomings. I have found that most high-performers justify this negativity bias and use “beating themselves up over mistakes” as a probable means of speeding up the improvement process. Unfortunately, they are all wrong. The perfectionist mentality actually slows progress because of the negative impact it has on one’s self-confidence. Keep in mind, self-confidence is the number one variable for human performance.

Before working with Kelly, she would mostly fixate on what went wrong in a performance. I knew Kelly was brought in to help instruct other high-level violinists on occasion. To make a point, I asked Kelly, “After listening to your students play, would you only comment on what went wrong with their performance?” Her response surprised both of us: “I would never teach with only that perspective. In a masterclass as a featured guest artist, I always recognize a student’s strengths before zeroing in on their challenges, and I don’t know why I didn’t catch it for myself.”

When it comes down to evaluation—no matter if it’s self-evaluation or assessing others—if you want to speed the process of improvement, always follow one simple rule:

Next time you are evaluating a performance, force yourself to recognize three things that went well. This will help increase the likelihood of those “done wells” happening in the next performance. After recognizing your “done wells,” then identify the one most important improvement you want to make. Doing so will keep your confidence high and keep you hungry and focused on improving.

Kelly began the daily practice of recognizing what she was doing well in addition to pushing herself to consistently improve. She says, “A big component of dramatically improving my  ability to perform under pressure, my business successes, and most importantly, joy in life is making sure to count ‘done wells’ in a daily capacity.”

Waiting until you are feeling mentally weak to use tools for improving confidence is like going to get your vaccination after you already have the flu. It is important to work on recognizing “done wells” on good days so that when the tough days occur, your confidence will be strong enough to work through adversity.

The following are the three questions my clients complete daily to maintain the confidence and drive to achieve ultimate levels of success—and enjoy it along the way:

Spending no more than two minutes per day answering these three questions will put you in the position to draw more enjoyment from what you are working so hard to achieve. This will begin to support your drive to improve, rather than drown you in disappointment and discouragement. And who knows, you may even find yourself in the rare company of those like Kelly Hall-Tompkins who are “better than perfect.”",
"The leading European provider of financial APIs — application programming interfaces — has upgraded its Data API service so that fintech firms can now directly access financial data from a variety of Open Banking APIs in one single platform. TrueLayer, which was founded in 2016 by Italian entrepreneurs Francesco Simoneschi and Luca Martinetti, then became one of the first British companies to be authorised to provide account information and payment initiation services through Open Banking. The firm hopes that its updated Data API service will help businesses save both time and money by unifying APIs in one place.

“On the surface, this news is technical, interesting only to developers,” explains Vedika Jain, the Product Manager for Data API at TrueLayer. “Going deeper, it’s about more useful financial products being built, giving customers greater choice and a future where we all have access to the best financial services.""

“We see more and more companies emerging that make it easier for individuals and businesses to manage their finances. To build these useful services, these companies need access to transactional data. At its core, this is what the Data API is about — turning ideas into applications that use transaction data with a few lines of code so that our clients can focus on what matters — products and customers.”

Through the improved Data API service, TrueLayer will provide Open Banking with access to major banks across Europe including Barclays, HSBC Group, Lloyds Group, Santander and RBS.

Open APIs, which are also known as Public APIs, are used by a company to give consumers universal access to a service or platform that they have developed. The Open API refers to the specific software that is deployed, allowing another firm to “communicate” with the original service.

This can be best explained by using Facebook as an example; a company that has achieved considerable success by making its services public so that developers and other users can integrate its platforms into their software products.

The end result has seen a whole host of companies using Facebook software to boost their own operations, such as Facebook Lean Ads where users can register with a business at the click of a button. The Facebook Lean Ads software then pre-populates the requested details making potential customers feel far less reluctant about sending their personal details when they want to register with a platform.

Facebook also uses the Facebook Insights API to allow businesses to see which of their messages on the social media platform are being shared the most and which get the best reactions, making it a novel form of sentiment analysis.

This information, which previously would only have been available to Facebook, is a win-win as it is accessible via an Open API. A business can see which of its data is generating the most traffic and, as a result, it can be more selective and not waste money on ineffective advertising. Given this transparency, firms are also more likely to advertise on Facebook again, letting the social media company generate more profit as the firm pays for more messaging.

One such industry which has embraced the use of Open APIs is Open Banking; it aims to return ownership of financial information from the banks to consumers and developers. Customers can choose to give their permission, thus allowing their personal financial data to be shared with fintechs. This might include their spending habits or the names of companies from which they make purchases. The fintechs can then, in turn, analyze the information received and recommend new products such as a credit card or an app that matches a consumer’s history.

In Europe, this trend has been facilitated by regulation on a multilateral, bureaucratic level and therefore on domestic markets.

The European Union introduced the Payment Services Directive (PSD2) on January 13 of this year. The legislation was introduced to increase pan-European competition within the banking sector and to support innovation from non-traditional banks, such as third-party providers like Google or Amazon. From this date, member states were obliged to introduce new regulation within their domestic markets.

In the United Kingdom, for example, a series of reforms were introduced after the introduction of PSD2 and pressure from the Competition and Markets Authority watchdog.  A new body called the Open Banking Implementation Entity came into force as a result of PSD2 aiming to open-up banking data in the UK.

From January 13, the nine largest current account providers have had to offer standardized APIs to approved third parties, providing details of both Account Information Services (AIS) and Payment Initiation Services (PIS). AIS refers to the provision of a customer’s account information, such as transactions to third parties while PIS gives permission for a provider to enact a payment from an account held with a different bank. Both require the consumer’s permission to access their personal data.

Open Banking has a number of advantages to traditional banks, disrupters and also the consumer. In an age where 51% of European adults use online banking, banks like the HSBC Group or Santander gain the ability to connect with other Open APIs in the market and provide their customers with fintech solutions for a more rounded banking experience.

One such example of this is the Experian Connect API. This gives consumers access to their credit scores and credit report online through their bank via an app or website.

For start-up banking platforms and fintechs, Open Banking legislation, like PSD2, allows them to use a bank’s customer data to create or hone their platform to meet consumers needs. The start-up may already possess an innovative concept but not the platform required. A partnership built upon the inside knowledge of a bank, through Open Banking, can provide this – everyone is, therefore, a winner.

For the consumer, the opening up of the banking industry can only mean good things as it increases competition between traditional banks and start-ups and also encourages co-operation between the two. New user-friendly platforms are now continuously made available, such as the previously mentioned Experian Connect API, streamlining and simplifying consumers’ experience and responding to customers’ needs.

In a report into the habits of 5,000 European banking customers by technology firm Sopra Banking Software, 69% of those surveyed stated that it was important for them to have an innovative bank yet only 12% of respondents in the survey had considered their banks as being innovative.

The emergence of Open Banking is set to change all that.

TrueLayer alone boasts partnerships with Zopa, which provides fast income verification for banks, Canopy, which automatically updates customers’ rental information, and Anorak, which provides faster and more accurate insurance quotes. The firm has also integrated with ClearScore, CreditLadder, BitBond, Plum and Emma, with further partnerships expected to be announced shortly.

“Open APIs such as Open Banking presents an incredible opportunity for businesses and consumers,” says Francesco Simoneschi, the Co-Founder and CEO of TrueLayer. “It has the capacity to cause a huge explosion in new fintech products and services which will vastly increase competition and standards in financial services. Compared to credential sharing and private APIs, they will provide a more reliable service as well as a better experience for consumers.”

In addition to a presence in the United Kingdom, Simoneschi and Martinetti have plans to expand across the continent and further afield. After a successful $7.5 million fundraising round in July, TrueLayer has expanded into Germany, with further plans in place to establish a platform in France and Italy before looking for growth outside the continent.

“Our expansion to Germany was a very natural choice,” explains Simoneschi. “It has the largest consumer base in Europe and therefore the biggest market for Open Banking-based products and services. Berlin, Munich and Frankfurt are also thriving tech hubs with a wealth of talent, ideas and the appetite to innovate. We intend to build out our offering for German customers and then make similar moves in France.”

For Simoneschi, however, the potential of Open Banking to revolutionize a consumers banking experience is limitless and he believes after the implementation of PSD2 in January this year, innovation is just beginning.

“Where we develop from there in Europe will be largely dictated by demand and the development of PSD2,” he enthuses. “Ultimately, we want to be Europe’s leading provider of financial APIs and the biggest player in Open Banking infrastructure. Beyond Europe, we’ll study how Open Banking develops in markets such as Australia, Singapore, Canada, India and the US before making firmer plans.”

“In any case, it’s one step at a time, there’s plenty more work for us to do in the UK and Europe.”",
"Recently, we’ve seen upskilling and retraining programs emerge in workforces across the globe. Companies are taking the time to help their employees learn new skills for new positions as new technology emerges. This is great, don’t get me wrong, but I think we need to focus more on continuous learning for all employees. This definitely would work in conjunction with upskilling programs, but as leaders who are trying to drive transformation, the onus is with us to encourage learning across the organization.

When was the last time you went to a leadership development class? Or the last time you did any classes to help learn new skills? If you aren’t doing it, then how can you expect your employees to do? If we don’t encourage our employees to continue to learn, we can’t expect them to continue to handle the weight of the transformation itself. How can we prepare? By encouraging continuous learning for all employees, no matter their position or rank. Let’s take a look at why this is so important.

Most employees see on-the-job education as an extra, something they must do on top of the rest of their work. I know I’ve definitely been to seminars or lectures where I’m just checking the box for some requirement. And I’ll be honest, in those scenarios I rarely paid attention and I rarely learned anything. This is why we need to shift the mindset. Encourage continuous learning by framing it as an opportunity for growth, not a requirement. Shift to this mindset and allow your employees to thrive in a culture focused on education instead. It will take more than encouraging your team to take an online course. In fact, it will take you changing the atmosphere of your organization to focus on education as a priority.

As a manager or business owner, how can you make that happen? After all, your employees DO have a lot on their plate already. Put simply, it starts with you.

Learning Isn’t About the Promotion; It’s About Value

I never ever want to see or hear someone say they are only at a professional development class because their manager said it would help them get a promotion. What kind of message does that send to your team? You should give promotions based on practical qualifications not arbitrary requirements.

I’m not a fan of making any education mandatory, but if you do decide to make something a requirement, make sure your team members see you talk positively about what you’ve learned. Encourage a discussion or dialogue to help them understand that what they’ve just learned is important to the business. Explain the value of the education and show that you also understand the value.

Helping employees see the value in their education is key. Whenever you’re goal setting as a team, take the time to pick a few skills that employees could develop to help achieve goals. Share your thoughts with your team about the talents you’re waiting to develop. Then constantly encourage employees to develop those skills and talents.

Employees that take the time to learn or hone their skills should be recognized and praised in some way. Some employees might come away from a class inspired to take action—let them. As you work to foster a culture of continuing education and growth, make sure you celebrate each initiative they try, even if they fail. These moments are learning opportunities that are invaluable for those involved and the company as a whole.

Make it a priority, when projects fail, to talk about the why. Help your team to learn something, no matter the outcome, that they can use for the next thing they take on.

Consider the Workload of Your Team

Part of placing emphasis on education is allowing your team to involve themselves in it without struggling. An already full plate topped with mandatory classes is a recipe for disaster. Instead, encourage employees to take classes or go to seminars when it’s convenient for them. If you know your employees are busy after work hours, offer lunch and learn sessions or give them time during the work day to take a webinar or online class. Create a continuous learning program that best suits your workforce.

When you pile things on and make it all mandatory, you’re only going to make your employees more stressed and more likely to burnout faster. That will negatively affect your entire team.

We all know that when we suffer from a lack of inspiration, simply changing our surroundings can help. This is also true for our employees. Allow your team to enjoy new experiences such as new projects and location changes to jog their creativity. Give your team members special assignments that require more from them, using what they’ve learned throughout their retraining.

Allowing new experiences gives your team the benefit of new feedback and the ability to try new things. Change is frightening, especially for someone who feels comfortable in their current position. However, during the digital transformation, comfort will need to take a back seat to innovation. You must prepare your workforce by being an example and making education a part of the job, not just something to further ignore.

Focusing on people is one of the key pillars of digital transformation. Creating a culture of continuous learning is a great way to show your employees that you want them to succeed and grow. If you’re a leader who wants your team to grow, demonstrate that you’re committed to growth yourself. By doing a little bit of work, and making a few small changes, your company will see results.",
"Shopping used to be simple. When you needed a new razor, you went to the store, followed the signs to the right aisle, selected a razor from the two or three options available to you, and that was that. Today, there are not only dozens of brands of razors to choose from in-store, but you could spend days reading online reviews and social media posts trying to determine which option is best. If you didn’t want to go to the store, you could check Amazon and get a razor shipped to you in two days for free. You could even join a service that ships you a razor—plus shaving cream and anything else you might need—on a monthly basis.

Don’t get me wrong: As a buyer, I love the options and convenience that come along with today’s connected retail experience. But there’s no denying that it has complicated things for retailers. Simple transactions, like selecting a razor, a cup of coffee, or even a hotel, have now turned into a much longer process, with plenty of research, options, and steps along the way. To make sense of this complex new reality, brands are exploring “journey marketing.” It’s a concept that forces you to consider the points in a customer’s journey to or with your brand and ensure that the actions you’re taking at each point are effective. Visually, think of it as a map that starts with a consumer saying “Never hear of it” and ends with them telling their friends: “You have to try this!”

At large companies with hefty budgets, a full-blown journey marketing exercise might consist of investing in expensive marketing technology, hiring a research firm, and more. But even as a small business with limited time and money, you can still identify your various customer types, map out their pathways to conversion, and better connect with them along the way. Here are just a few pages you can take out of the “journey marketing” playbook.

Do your homework. First, find out as much as you can about your customers through any means necessary. Take note of gender, age, occupation, and more as you interact with customers in your store. If you have a significant social media following, dive into those analytics. Read up on data studies and other research produced by larger companies in your industry. You can even ask current customers to answer a short survey on their receipt or in a follow-up email in exchange for a discount. Young shoppers, in particular, are willing: A recent Salesforce survey found that roughly 60 percent of Millennial and GenX consumers are willing to share data in exchange for personalized offers and discounts. From there, separate your customer “personas” into groups based on common themes. Get out your crystal ball . Once you’ve identified the different types of customers who buy your product or use your service (or might in the future), consider all the steps they take to go from unfamiliar with your brand to repeat customer. Don’t just consider their path—anticipate their needs at each point on that path. For example, a common persona for guitar shop owners is the “adult beginner.” An adult beginner has different needs at the beginning, middle, and end of the purchasing process than a professional musician. By thinking through the adult beginner’s unique journey from “What in the world do I want to buy and from where?” to “I’m ready to buy another guitar from this store,” a store owner can better connect with that customer along the way. Grab your magnifying glass. After you’ve identified the different touchpoints that each of your customers has with your brand, take a closer look at the experience you’re providing at each of those touchpoints. Consider the “awareness” stage as an example—what’s the first interaction each of your customer types has with your brand? Is it your website, your Yelp profile, a sidewalk sign, or something else? Is each of those touchpoints set up to uniquely help each of your customers get to the next level with your brand? Consider, again, the guitar store owner who is mapping the journey of the adult beginner. Are the homepage and other initial touch points user-friendly to a first-time instrument buyer? Are the in-store employees equipped with recommendations for a beginner? After a purchase is made, will the customer get a follow-up email that recommends some other beginner essentials, like picks, a guitar strap, or a guitar stand?

The biggest benefit of a “journey marketing” exercise? A shift in your mindset. The process forces you to change the question from “How do I sell?” to “How does my customer buy?” It’s a small but impactful change that will help any small business make sense of today’s complex retail landscape and one that will hold true even as the industry continues to evolve and change.",
"It’s an axiom of modern management: people leave managers, not organizations. As Lattice CEO Jack Altman recently wrote in a Forbes post: “Of all the reasons people leave companies, having a bad manager tops the list. According to Gallup polls, a full 50% of employees who quit cite their manager as the reason.”

A Wall Street Journal article reporting on the research goes on to say: “Gallup found that workers whose managers hold regular meetings are three times more likely to be engaged—that is, feel involved in and enthusiastic about their jobs. Workers said they want to be in contact with bosses on a daily basis, and not just about sales targets or an upcoming presentation: they want their manager to take an interest in their personal lives, too.”

Would it surprise you to hear that the same phenomenon affects the relationship between freelancers and their client-managers?  Of course not.  So, what do effective managers of freelancers do differently?  Here are the big five trainable skills that separate effective client-managers of freelancers from others:

How should a company go about designing and delivering training to its managers on effectively managing freelancers?  A few tips:",
"The portrait of a great leader looks a little different to each of us. When we get down to it, though, many of the characteristics we expect of our leaders are fairly universal and timeless. When it comes to the employee-manager relationship, it turns out most of the workforce stands in agreement on some of the best qualities they want to see in the people they report to. Here are just a few of them.

There is an unmet need in the modern workforce when it comes to leaders who can listen. Despite being a priority for 88 percent of surveyed employees, only 60 percent of those employees felt their current leader or boss exhibited that trait.

Where does that leave us? In all honesty, it means you need the right people as leaders — even if it isn't necessarily you. The leaders that work most closely with the greatest number of people are the ones you want speaking and listening for your company. Apart from being a morale-booster for your teams and employees, there's real measurable value in leaders who know how to listen — including generating potentially great and profitable ideas.

Of course, opening yourself up to constructive criticism and suggestions is another challenge entirely. That brings us to our second point.

There's probably no counting the number of lawsuits that involved uncredited ideas, inventions, artwork, musical numbers and much more.

Having an environment that fosters experimentation, and actually taking the time to create a company ""ideas channel,"" are two of the best ways to uncover new opportunities and innovations for your company. However, employees need more than just a sympathetic ear. They need to know they'll be credited appropriately for that idea, even if all that's really needed is a shout-out at the next all-hands meeting.

To be sure, there are legal considerations too, as we've alluded to. However, if coming up with great ideas and elevating them is a part of your company's meritocracy and advancement process, you probably don't have to worry about that.

In some circumstances, it's probably a good thing that employees and teams tend to remake themselves in their leader's image. In many other places, though, don't you think you lose something there? Isn't the adaptation working in the wrong direction?

A lot has been said and written about great leaders who surrounded themselves with people who helped them see their blind spots, who brought new perspectives and who, more often than not, worked in a different fashion — even if their endpoint and goals were the same. It seems like a great leader might do well to become a chameleon of sorts.

With few exceptions, no work style is necessarily bad or good. A leader or boss should give their team members space, within reason, to discover the workflows, schedules, processes and tools that work best for them. The result is preservation of team harmony and a certain rigorous individuality in how your employees pursue their work. It also means you'll develop not one fixed management strategy, but rather a subtly tailor-made one for each person on the team.

It doesn't matter what line of work you're in — employees need to know their leaders are as invested in what's going on as they expect their employees to be. If you're a leader yourself, or even the founder or president of a company, you got there for a reason. It can't have been a mistake. Why were you passionate about what you do? Failing that, how can you go about cultivating a better love for what you do, even if you don't feel prepared for or inclined toward it?

There's a part of the grander picture here that your employees really need to be able to count on. You have a vision for the company and you want them to have one, too — but you need to communicate that passion using a richer language than earnings figures and other benchmarks. You presumably want to leave some kind of mark on the world. If that mark is hazy, indistinct or comes from a leader without a zeal for what they do, you can't expect the rest of the company to feel very invested either.

Psychology tells us there's a certain instinct in human beings when it comes to looking for role models. From an early age in school to coaches, professors, co-workers and eventually bosses and other kinds of leaders, we look for behavior we feel is worth emulating. Regrettably, all of us who strive toward positivity and good integrity in business and life, even if we fail sometimes, seem to be up against impossible odds. Our culture and even entertainment seem to reward brutishness and underhandedness.

As leaders, we can try to cultivate something different in the workplace. Integrity means treating everybody with respect uncompromisingly, not cutting corners, and maintaining a certain zeal for life even when not everything is ideal.

It's a tall order, and so are some of the other entries on this list — but they're worth working for.",productivity
"Do you know how often you use your smartphone? I didn’t — until I discovered Apple’s new feature, Screen Time, which tracks usage and sets parameters for how long you use certain apps. When I checked in on myself, I was shocked. Despite regularly “going dark” and taking one day a week “just to think,” my usage was super high. It made me realize I might be an addict, too!

The scariest part about smartphone addiction is that it can affect our physical and mental health, our relationships and our productivity. America’s obsession with smartphones has even been compared to the obesity epidemic.  That’s because, just like drug or gambling addictions, smartphones provide an escape from reality.

Humans are, by nature, prone to distraction. With smartphones, we literally have a world of distractions at our fingertips. It’s time to acknowledge that our devices can negatively impact our lives — and we have to make a change.

Cell phones used to just be communication tools. Now, they’re GPS, cameras, gaming consoles, health trackers, and the list goes on. We turn to our devices for everything  — from waiting in line at the grocery store or reading the news, to filing our taxes or controlling the thermostat. We don’t just use our smartphones for everything — we rely on them.

The brain on “smartphone” is the same as the brain on cocaine: we get an instant high every time our screen lights up with a new notification. It’s all thanks to dopamine, the feel-good chemical that gets released every time you do something you enjoy, like eating your favourite meal or getting a hundred likes on your latest Instagram post. Dopamine reinforces (and motivates) behaviour that makes us feel good and, in turn, can create addiction.

At the same time, having access to a constant flow of information has all but destroyed attention spans: a few years ago, a widely publicized study proved goldfish can focus longer than we can. This increase in ADD-like symptoms has been linked to the overuse of smartphones.

The effects of smartphone addiction don’t stop there; our overuse of technology has completely transformed how we communicate and interact with other people. Instead of getting real face time with the people in our lives, we often hide behind a screen. While technology can be a useful tool for keeping us connected, we have to be careful with when and how we use it.

This past summer, I took nine employees on a voluntourism trip to Kenya. We were in the middle of the Maasai Mara and literally had zero access to cell service or the internet. At first, everyone felt anxious and uncomfortable about not being able to check in online. But after a few days, we all realized how rare it is to fully disconnect like that. Going without our smartphones allowed us to connect more with each other and share the experience together.

I’m not saying we should get rid of smartphones and cancel our WiFi. There’s nothing wrong with using the technology available to us. But when our smartphone usage interferes with our health and relationships with others, that’s when it becomes a problem. There’s a time and place to use devices and, more importantly, times to put them away.

Most people are aware of when it’s appropriate (or inappropriate) to use their smartphones, such as in meetings or job interviews, or on a first date. The scary thing is that the majority of those people will use them anyway! That’s where addiction comes into play: they know it’s wrong but they can’t control the compulsion to pick up their phones.

When I was in France with my family earlier this year, I was fascinated by how few cell phones we saw. People have them, of course, but they’re not constantly glued to their screens all day, every day. It’s rare to see someone walking down the street, phone in hand. Technology doesn’t control people’s lives there the same way it does in North America.

It’s been proven that smartphones interfere with productivity, and I agree this is a big issue. But the more critical problem is how they affect our mental health. We need to act now before the toll of smartphone addiction gets even worse.

France seems to be ahead of the game: last month, lawmakers enforced a ban on smartphones in schools. Last year, they gave people the legal right to disconnect from work — no checking emails or taking calls — outside of working hours.

We have a similar program at our company called “going dark.” When people go on vacation, we encourage them to have a colleague change their email password so they won’t even be tempted to check in. I do this every time I go away, too. This practice has done wonders for my mental well being and my productivity when I get back to work.

Where Do We Go From Here?

In North America, there’s constant pressure to be plugged in 24/7 and it’s causing serious health problems. I’m glad to see that companies in the smartphone industry are taking strides to combat problems. But giving people the ability to limit their own usage with programs like Screen Time isn’t enough. It’s the equivalent of telling an alcoholic to lock their liquor cabinet but letting them keep the key.

Dealing with smartphone addiction starts by hacking our internal operating systems. Ask a trusted friend to change your email password over the weekend, or your social media passwords during the work day. Use a website blocker app on your browser to prevent you from using distracting sites when you need to be productive.

It’s truly incredible how much smartphones today can do. We all have the choice whether to use that power to our detriment or to our advantage.",
"Disrupters, rebels, challengers, deviants, and the like are crucial for population, organization and team survival over time. The highest performing teams function with a minimum of disruption. They do well. But they are resistant to the changes required to evolve and survive over time. This is why you need a meaningful level of disruption, challenge, rebellion, and deviation on a team. The trouble with being at the peak is that the only way to go from there is down. Root out complacency and keep your team striving for a new peak.

By the end of 2017, only 60 of the 1955 Fortune 500 still existed. And it continues. Witness GE’s continued free-fall and most latest $22.8B quarterly loss. Some members of the Fortune 500 like IBM survived near-death experiences on the way. Even Apple almost disappeared until Steve Jobs to reinvent the company.

At the most recent HATCH Summit at Moonlight Basin, Montana, a recurring theme was the importance of diversity.

Astrobiologist Luke McKay explained how even if the odds are one in a million that one of gazillion planets in the universe has life, the mathematical probability is that there are aliens. NASA’s definition of life: “Self-sustaining chemical system capable of Darwinian evolution.”

Note that Darwinian populations evolve through their mutations, which are - by definition - different from the norm. And note that the environment determines which mutations survive as opposed to the mutations picking their environment.

Kristian Ribberstrom, The Medici Group’s chief experience officer, asked whether it’s better to hire someone with seven critical strengths or three. If the seven strengths overlap strengths already on the team and the three are new to the team, the three are more valuable than the seven.

Creative partner Aithan Shapira discussed the need to change perspectives to give people permission to be who they are and permission to change. Most first look at only the middle 7% of a painting while experts take in 70% of the same painting. He took us through the 1949 radical change in Jackson Pollock’s painting style from recognizable to revolutionary and how that gave permission to other artists to change their perspective.

Jeff Leitner solves problems others run away from. His book, See Think Solve, is an ode to deviation - an existing or new behavior so powerful that it can subvert the informal, unspoken social norm keeping problems unsolved. Teams functioning without deviation can’t overcome their social norms to solve new problems.

Chris Wink, Phil Stanton and Matt Goldman started the Blue Man Group by wandering around – literally. They dressed as the Blue Man character and wandered around to see how people reacted. Some didn’t see them. Some couldn’t see them. Some actively ignored them. Some thought they were cool.

They learned the character was not one, but three. It’s not “Blue Man.” It’s the “Blue Man .” As Chris said, “Three is one.” Their magic is in the collaboration as they put on different capes to see the world with fresh eyes, overcoming their “disabilities” of being blue men with holes in their chests, and reacting to everyday situations in new ways. Their different capes include:

Diversity is not a goal. It’s the key to survival over time.

Find and nurture people with differential strengths that complement those already existing on your team, not reinforcing them.

Do not push for perfect alignment of peoples’ behaviors, relationships and attitude with your existing culture. Do not bring in a complete cultural misfit like NBC did with Megyn Kelly; but do push for some evolutionary deviation on one or more dimensions.

With all that in mind, don’t wiggle on purpose. Require rock-solid commitment to that.",
"There is no shortage of research on the impact that boards can have on the performance and profitability of the organizations they serve. In today’s business context, boards face higher expectations, increased scrutiny by the community, press, politicians, and the street, and significant increases in the velocity of demands of their attention. These realities create a need for boards to be as effective as possible in driving profitability for the firms they serve. Board inefficiencies and lack of effectiveness are simply not something that organizations can afford. Setting up boards for success starts during the recruitment process, and some recent research sheds some light on how to make this process have greater positive impact.

Selecting the right people to serve on your board.

Unfortunately, the selection of board members can often fall back to the same old approaches- identifying “friends” who seem to have the right experience and expertise to support the organization based on where they are currently.

Recent research conducted by Solange Charas and discussed in a recent article in Harvard Business Review shows a link between the quality of board member interactions and the ability of their organizations to generate economic value.

She also found that board members who did not know each other prior to the board service were more likely to engage in productive cognitive conflict.

Some of Ms. Charas’ research findings also include the following:

These are some pretty compelling findings, in my opinion, and they call into question the norms of recruiting board members who are “friendlies” as opposed to making the effort to identify board recruits who may be outside of your normal spheres but who bring a certain personal, political, or optical dynamics that help the group collaborate and move work forward in a clear and expedited manner.

What do boards need to be most successful?

While not all boards are created equal, there are some fundamental elements that have been shown to increase the ability of boards to function most effectively.

Some practical tips for your consideration.

Going a bit beyond the best practices already discussed, the following can be practically applied to begin shaping your board to pre-empt dysfunction and to achieve greater effectiveness over time.

Regardless of where your board is currently, there is always room to improve, and the research is clear that highly functioning boards can have a significant positive impact on the performance of their organizations. Charas’ most recent research sheds some light on the importance of extending the search for potential board members well beyond the “circle of trusted friends” in order to help create an interpersonal dynamic amongst your board that balances collaboration with productive conflict. But, as we all know, board effectiveness goes far beyond the process of recruiting of new members. The question is, will you assemble a board by default or a board by design?

Note: Charas measured Board dynamics using 30-item Team Dynamic Inventory, a team-level assessment measures four key dimensions of team interaction. This tool was developed by Tony Lingham, associate professor at Case Western Reserve University’s Weatherhead School of Management.",
"With about 40 - 50% of marriages in the United States ending in divorce, we know that marriages can prove to be challenging. But what happens when partners are facing additional challenges that come with being an entrepreneur? In what ways does this affect the likelihood of marital success?

Now, I am not aware of the exact divorce statistics for entrepreneurs, but I’d put money on them being on the higher side of average. Being an entrepreneur often means putting in long work hours, dealing with the highs and lows of executing business ideas, and making only a fraction of what you would make in a regular job. This could go on for months or even years before the business grows to a point where financial gains are significant.

The entire family feels this pressure, especially your partner. Despite their best intentions, entrepreneurs tend to make the world’s worst other halves because so much of their time is invested in building their companies. This can lead to marital troubles or even become a trigger for divorce.

One of the first signs of trouble brewing in paradise is a lack of communication. When you and your spouse stop expressing yourselves effectively, other cracks begin to emerge. Let’s talk about some things you should focus on to improve the quality of communication in your marriage:

Say please and thank you more often.

Talk to any marriage expert and they will tell you: No one likes to be bossed around, especially not by their spouses. Entrepreneurs are used to directing orders to employees on a daily basis, but pushing out orders as if you were a drill sergeant is not likely to go down well at home. Remember to approach your better half in a calm, respectful manner, and say please and thank you when you make an ask.

Use more ‘I’ and less ‘you’ in conversations.

In marriages, the essence of a phrase that starts with “you” often translates to: “I’m hurt, and you did it to me.” And there’s often a subtext: “You were mean and wrong for doing this to me.” Using more “I” than “you” in conversations averts a situation where your spouse feels like they need to self-defend. It creates room for introspection and gives your spouse a chance to either agree or clarify what they really meant.

This goes both ways for spouses in an entrepreneur household. Entrepreneurs generally have tight schedules and sometimes it becomes difficult for them to devote as much time at home. Hearing “you never help me with chores” is more likely to put you on the defensive. On the other hand, you would be happy to put in that extra effort if your spouse says, “ I wish you could help me out more with the chores.”

Another key for entrepreneurs to start communicating better with their better halves is by getting them to empathize. Rather than getting frustrated, tell them that you can’t relax or spend time with them, or even the kids, until you finish a big project, but that you are working hard to help cement the family’s financial future. Believe in the power of gentle words to encourage your spouse to see through your bleary eyes.

In other words, have an attitude of gratitude. As an entrepreneur, you are constantly dealing with time crunches and are rarely able to pitch in extra household help. So, whenever your spouse does something nice for you -- like letting you sleep in or washing the dishes when it’s your turn -- take a moment to show appreciation. Reward them by doing something special for them that you both enjoy, like planning a dinner date.

Find the right time to talk.

If there’s something on your mind that’s bothering you, do not look for the first opportunity to talk about it with your partner. Doing it at a time when you are stressed about work is only going to make matters worse. Try to remain calm about it and look for the right time to talk. You may even want to schedule some time to talk about it if one or both of you are really occupied.

Be intentional about spending time together. Turn off all of your devices and make a point to spend 20-30 minutes a day catching up with one another, no matter how busy you are at work.

As well, avoid talking about serious issues in writing. It may seem easier to send off a text message, email or note from your desk, but if you or your spouse are upset, it’s easy to misinterpret that message. Always talk about issues face to face so there isn’t an unnecessary misunderstanding about tone of voice or intention. This can be difficult because entrepreneurs don’t always have the time to speak about matters face to face, so use the 48-hour rule to determine whether or not it’s worth bringing up. If you’re still hurt 48 hours later, confront your partner in person about it. If not, consider letting it go.

Open up and be honest.

Yes, honesty is still the best policy. The truth hurts at times, but it’s often the only way to healthy communication and a better relationship. Admit to yourself that you aren’t always right yourself and apologize when you make a mistake, rather than making an excuse. You will not only feel better about it, but it will also open up doors for longer and healthier conversations.

The last communication pillar of a strong marriage that I would like to leave you with is dropping your guard. Be open to building honest and vulnerable conversations devoid of fear and scrutiny.",None
"It’s an exciting time to see companies commit to luring and retaining top female talent. More and more, these industry leaders are attempting to support new parents as they seek to integrate work and family life. The organizations extending benefits to new parents are leading the charge in the modern workforce and adopting policies that reflect a change in ethos.

With so many companies pledging to make parenthood an integrated part of work life, it’s hard to keep up with the different benefits and packages available. Working Mother, a key resource for working parents everywhere, annually lists the 100 Best Companies while outlining and exploring how companies are wrecking the status quo and shifting the landscape.

First the good news. As employers continue to draft their policies and shape them to fit the needs of working parents, we’re finding “family-friendly” perks and packages rapidly emerging. Here’s a sampling of a few interesting and promising contemporary benefits from Working Mother’s top 10 list:

And while these benefits are indeed welcome additions to more traditional family-friendly packages, many companies on this list are doing the bare minimum.  Here's the bad news.

There is something appalling absent in 25% of these 100 Best Companies: they have less than eight weeks of paid parental leave. After further investigation, I discovered the requirement to be considered on the top 100 list is only one week of paid leave. I was shocked.

Multiple studies reinforce that paid leave pays. It improves health outcomes of the mother and child, contributes to keeping new working mothers engaged in the workforce, can promote gender equality if equal leave is offered to fathers and pays for itself. Research from the Boston Consulting Group outlines that paid leave works. It significantly reduces attrition rates, attracts better talent, improves morale and productivity, shows a commitment to employees and values and also attracts consumers and improving the brand. For example, when Google expanded their leave from 12 weeks to 18 weeks, the rate at which new mothers quit dropped by 50% . That translates into millions of dollars saved for the company as well as improved morale and retention of knowledge. And EY ran a study showing that 92% of employers with a paid leave policy reported a positive or no effect on profitability. How could such a crucial and significant requirement be that low? How could we possibly tout that company as supportive for working mothers? While Working Mother doesn't rate these companies from 1-100, they do highlight the Top 10 companies and even one of those companies, WellStar, which we highlighted above for its innovative WellBee program, shockingly only offers three weeks of fully paid leave.

I reached out to Working Mother and am happy to share that this dismal requirement is being reviewed.  Stefanie McNamara, a spokesperson for Working Mother stated:

We are also continuing to challenge our companies to do better in this area. Moving forward, we are giving companies the option to either fill out maternity / paternity leave separately OR filling it out as family leave, as this is a growing trend: 18 percent of Working Mother 100 Best Companies offer the same number of weeks for maternity and paternity leave (up from 10 percent in 2015). This is such an important area of focus for working mothers, and our goal is to continue to raise the bar. Also, companies answer hundreds of questions when applying, and we measure many different areas in addition to maternity leave policies, including: women's advancement, flexible work schedules, phase-back programs, childcare/other benefits, corporate culture, etc.

While paid leave isn’t the entire puzzle, it’s certainly a major piece. It’s the piece that lays the groundwork for families, from improving the health of children, reducing stress and rates of depression for new mothers and increases dads involvement in housework and childcare. It’s a critical component that can’t be overlooked or derailed and must be supported at all costs.

Though most companies focused on assisting new parents are making incredible strides and creating impressive benefits, the timing of that support is critical. The ultimate key to attracting, retaining and engaging working mothers comes in the period immediately following delivery. Those invested in this period will not only foster the health and well being of mother and child but will retain loyal and happy talent. We can, and we must do better.",None
"For many people, just the thought of sitting down in front of a blank screen with the expectation of producing sentences that deliver a message or tell a story produces tremendous anxiety. It's a feeling I've experienced far more often than I'd care to admit throughout the two decades I've worked as a professional writer and editor.

It's not just about figuring out how to get started, either. It's also very much about having the guts to hit publish and share your work with the wider world, to expose the innermost workings of your soul to the harsh winds of scrutiny.

One writer who managed to overcome her fear of publishing is Nicole Chung, the editor in chief of Catapult, a literary magazine. Chung recently published her first book, All You Can Ever Know, a memoir about her quest as an adopted child to track down her biological parents.

In a recent article in The Atlantic's ""By Heart"" series on writing, Chung describes how an essay about sailing by E.B. White has served as the perfect metaphor for the very gradual process she has undergone during her journey as a writer. In his essay, White describes how he progressed from smaller, more manageable boats to bigger boats and more challenging voyages.

""For me, it's hard to read [his] essay without thinking about my own relationship to writing...I think that's what writers do, too. Like White and his boats, I started small. I began writing mostly for myself, not really trying to publish during the entirety of my 20s, despite writing almost every day. I told myself there was no way I could ever make a living as a writer, so I would just claim writing as a hobby.""

Outside of a daily diary she had kept since kindergarten, Chung didn't take a serious interest in writing until she was in her mid-20s, when she joined a nonfiction writing group.

""When I found that I really liked writing essays, it was kind of a shock,"" Chung tells The Atlantic. I kept writing and sharing with a few people at a time, but I would never have thought to publish those pieces. I've still never published them. Getting your sea legs is not a bad metaphor for what I was doing at that time. I was standing there, dipping my toes in the water, not really sure if I wanted to jump in. I didn't pitch or publish my first piece online until I was 30 or 31.""

In my case, I started even later than Chung. I had been writing and editing content for other people for 15 years before I started to write short essays on LinkedIn that I published under my own name. And, while I have yet to publish my first book like her (I'm working on it!), I have maintained a weekly routine of writing and publishing at least one new article. It's a hobby, yes, but also a habit that has helped me hone my ability to articulate my thoughts around a particular topic.

I remember, though, before hitting publish on my first article on LinkedIn, spending at least a year, probably two if I'm more honest, just chewing on ideas and thinking about what I should write. My advice to aspiring writers would be to not do what I did, and instead do what Nicole Chung did: Start writing just for yourself, don't obsess about what others think, keep writing, and then either hit publish somewhere --LinkedIn, Medium, your own blog -- or just file it away indefinitely in your drafts folder.

""I think it's useful for everyone,"" Chung advises, ""no matter what stage of their career they're at, to know it's okay to write for yourself first -- sometimes only for yourself. There are going to be things that you might need to work out on the page, alone, before you're ready to share them more widely. I don't think there's always a rush. It's okay to take the longer voyage.""",
"I was on the radio last week, and on the show we discussed a recent WSJ article about Nestlé's CEO, Mark Schneider's, take on work-life balance.

Schneider believes the job comes first. He doesn't talk about what's lacking in his personal life, but figures out a system so that he has some level of fulfillment in both areas: work and life.

To be the best at anything, there is no balance. When you love something so much, you don't want to take your foot off the pedal. You run on adrenaline to be better.

An important thing for leaders to remember is that just because this is their belief or approach to work and life, doesn't mean it's right for their staff. The key for any hard charging CEO is to have compassion for the rank-in-file...to have compassionate accountability: know what your people need and when, but hold them accountable to meeting deadlines and getting the work done.

In the article, Schneider goes on to talk about the importance of work-life balance when attracting talent. Running a business is like raising children, you have to know what each employee needs to achieve and succeed.

Don't assume everyone wants work-life balance. If you get a candidate who is money motivated or wants to advance their career quickly, they're not concerned about the work-life balance programs and initiatives. They want to know about your training and development programs, or what career pathing looks like at your organization. If you assume they want work-life balance, and that's all you promote, you could turn them off because it doesn't line up with what they're looking for.

Successful careers are not a one-size-fits-all. Don't assume what one job seeker wants applies to the masses. Drill down during the interview on what the candidate is motivated by, and if doesn't match up with what your organization offers, don't try to fit a round peg into a square hole. It won't last.",
"I've seen it plenty of times throughout my career. An executive makes a decision that employees don't like, or think isn't fair. It starts with employees banding together through behind-the-door talks and conversations at the water cooler, and eventually turns into a full-on employee revolt.

So, the question is, now what should you do as a leader of the company? Do you ignore it and hope it goes away, or do you address it head-on with hopes that it doesn't spiral out of control? Either way, you run the risk of making it worse.

If not done properly, employees might quit out of protest or send out a mass email stating their disagreement with the decision. It makes you, the leader, look bad and lose of control of the situation.

1. Before making any rash decisions, show your employees that you're listening to their concerns.

One of my favorite books, Never Split the Difference: Negotiating as if Your Life Depended on It, shares stories about how to negotiate in tough situations. According to author Chris Voss, the best way to negotiate with them is by empathetically listening to their demands. This shouldn't be news to anyone, but it's surprisingly rare how few people listen in these situations.

The best way to prove that your listening is to mirror them and repeat the words they tell you back to them. A negotiators goal is to find out what the other person is really angry about. What do they really want to happen?

Leaders in this situation are no different. Find out the core reason for your employees revolting. Is it the pay? Is it the promotion policies? Is it because executives are constantly treated better than the regular staff? Don't just listen to the demands, listen to why they are revolting in the first place.

2. Reiterate the shared vision you have for the company and get re-alignment.

It's been proven by multiple studies that when employees agree on a shared vision, they are more productive and engaged in their work. Essentially, you need to get the employees to understand why you made the decision you made and why it was the best decision for the shared vision of the company.

Sit down the core group of employees who are revolting and talk about your shared goals and let them share what they think the goals of the company are. This brings the conversation to the overall vision of the company, and not the individual tactics.

Of course, don't turn this into a bait-and-switch. You still have to address the main reason they're revolting. You can't tell them to calm down and tell them it wasn't a big deal. That's not how this works.

3. Words are cheap. Acknowledge the issue and take action immediately.

For Google, 200 employees organizing a walkout is a small subset of the company, but that's only the employees who are willing to put their career on the line in a public spotlight. This is not an easy move for them to make.

Remember, those are just the organizers. If no action is taken, 200 employees can easily turn into 1,000 or even 10,000 in a very short timeframe. Whatever that action is, you need to address it with words and action as soon as possible.",
"Most new entrepreneurs are focused intently on the challenges of being a founder. And for good reason--issues tend to spring up overnight. Your startup won't last long if you aren't constantly looking out for problems.

I certainly didn't think much about the benefits of being a founder during the early stages of my company. There was too much going on, too many difficult decisions to be made. Staying vigilant was more important than reflecting on the strides we were making.

However, I'm much more thankful and appreciative of what this role has given me now that we've scaled and I can look back on several years of experience.

1. You're in control of your own destiny.

You're the one making the final decisions and setting the strategy. When things go right, you see your vision come to life. It's really powerful to see the tremendous growth that's occurred, and you feel a sense of ownership over that.

The difficult part about controlling your destiny is that it never gets easier. You can (and should) learn from past decisions, but the context is always different. The choices become more complex as your company grows, and each one has a different impact on your team.

It may not get easier, but the longer you stick with it, the more hindsight you have. And reflecting on where you've been and how far you've come is one of the most rewarding parts of the position.

2. You get to be a role model.

No one really starts their company imagining they'll be someone who others learn from and look to. But as you grow and find success in your own business, this dynamic will evolve.

It's really interesting to watch within your own team--seeing people develop, grow, and learn during their time at the company. It feels very personal and real because you've hired everyone who works for you. If they came on in the early days, you probably interviewed them yourself.

Without a doubt, I've grown and learned a tremendous amount as a founder. But it's amazing to see people on the team who've also stepped up and come so far in their personal development. I've had people come up to me at different times--even people leaving the company--and tell me how much they've learned.

Being a role model isn't just limited to within your company. Once you get into the public eye, you'll begin to meet people at speaking engagements and events who tell you about how your work and your company has inspired them.

3. You establish so many relationships and build an incredible network.

A strong network is so valuable because it provides you with a variety of people you can go to for advice about a specific question. For instance, when debating which agency to work with for a brand campaign, my co-founder Dave and I asked a fellow CEO for his honest opinion about one of the agencies. Having those relationships helps you make better decisions and gives you access to information that can positively impact your bottom line.",
"On the one hand, that's a very good thing. Instead of leading a robotic existence, our feelings and emotions motivate and inspire us. The problem is when we become victims of those emotions. At times, all of us let temporary feelings and moods rule the way we make decisions, even when it leads to actions we later regret.

Since most of the emotions you experience occur almost instinctively, you can't control how you feel in any given moment. But you can control how you react to those feelings--by focusing on your thoughts.

In my new book, EQ Applied: The Real-World Guide to Emotional Intelligence, I compare your ability to direct your thoughts to a set of controls on a media player. Just like these controls can help you get the most out of a movie or song, these methods will help you manage your emotional reactions.

When you hit pause, you take time to stop and think before you speak or act. Doing so can prevent you from saying or doing something you'll later regret--like sending an angry email or posting something regrettable on social media.

How to use it: If you feel your emotions are getting out of control, take a pause. If possible, go for a short walk. Once you've had the chance to calm down, come back and decide how you want to move forward.

Have you ever noticed that when speaking with someone, the other person usually responds in the exact same style or tone as you? If you're calm and rational, they'll respond in kind. Yell or scream, and they'll do the same.

Hitting Mute is helpful because, often, sharing your point of view when your partner is emotional won't help the situation. The best thing you can do is let the other person express their feelings.

How to use it: Take a deep breath and remind yourself that both your mood and that of your communication partner are temporary. Remember that much of what they say at this point may be extreme or exaggerated; resist the urge to respond in kind.

How to use it: As you tune into the other person, don't judge or offer advice. Instead, focus on learning more about how the other person sees you, how they see themselves, and how they see the situation.

That's why you can't just try to forget about the situation. Instead, use rewind to revisit the topic at a later time, once everyone's had the chance to cool down.

For example, opening with an apology, an expression of thanks, or by acknowledging where you and your communication partner agree may lead the other person to lower their guard and become more open to whatever you have to say.

How to use it: The next time you're dealing with negative feelings or a bad mood, slow down and ask yourself why you feel the way you do. Can you take action to change a situation or circumstance and make things better? Or, can you ask someone for help?",

"Training bystanders how to recognize, intervene and show empathy to targets of sexual assault has been found to be an effective way to increase awareness and disrupt assaults before they happen. Now, some companies are trying to use bystander training to combat sexual harassment as well. This strategy recognizes that, when it comes to workplace culture, everyone is responsible for creating it, every day, in every interaction. Bystanders don’t need to directly confront a harasser to have an impact; using humor to call out bad behavior (“What year is it? 1970?”) or even just changing the subject can help. Then, you can decide how to escalate the situation to a supervisor or HR.

As the wave of #MeToo stories have come to light over the past year, it’s become painfully clear that whatever organizations are doing to try to prevent sexual harassment isn’t working.

Ninety-eight percent of companies say they have sexual harassment policies. Many provide anti-sexual harassment training. Some perpetrators have been fired or fallen from grace. And yet more than four decades after the term “sexual harassment” was first coined, it remains a persistent and pervasive problem in virtually every sector and in every industry of the economy, our new Better Life Lab report finds. It wreaks financial, physical, and psychological damage, keeping women and other targets out of power or out of professions entirely. It also costs billions in lost productivity, wasted talent, public penalties, private settlements, and insurance costs.

So what does work? Or might?

Sadly, there’s very little evidence-based research on strategies to prevent or address sexual harassment. The best related research examines sexual assault on college campuses and in the military. That research shows that training bystanders how to recognize, intervene, and show empathy to targets of assault not only increases awareness and improves attitudes, but also encourages bystanders to disrupt assaults before they happen, and help survivors report and seek support after the fact.

Researchers and workplace experts are now exploring how to prevent sexual harassment in companies by translating that approach. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in its 2016 task force report encouraged employers to offer bystander training, for one. And New York City passed a law in May requiring all companies with more than 15 employees to begin providing bystander training by April 2019. It could prove a promising, long-term solution.

But culture change is hard — it can take anywhere from months to several years, experts say. It’s much easier to go for the annual, canned webinar training on sexual harassment that checks the legal-liability box. Yet culture change is exactly why bystander interventions could be powerful: the strategy recognizes that, when it comes to workplace culture, everyone is responsible for creating it, every day, in every interaction.

Jane Stapleton, co-director of the Prevention Innovations Research Center at the University of New Hampshire and an expert in bystander interventions, told me about an all-too-familiar scenario: Say there’s a lecherous guy in the office — someone who makes off-color jokes, watches porn at his cubicle, or hits on younger workers. Everyone knows who he is. But no one says anything. Co-workers may laugh uncomfortably at his jokes, or ignore them. Maybe they’ll warn a new employee to stay away from him. Maybe not. “Everybody’s watching, and nobody’s doing anything about it. So the message the perpetrator gets is, ‘My behavior is normal and natural,’” Stapleton said. “No one’s telling him, ‘I don’t think you should do that.’ Instead, they’re telling the new intern, ‘Don’t go into the copy room with him.’ It’s all about risk aversion — which we know through decades of research on rape prevention, does not stop perpetrators from perpetrating.”

When bystanders remain silent, and targets are the ones expected to shoulder responsibility for avoiding, fending off, or shrugging off offensive behavior, it normalizes sexual harassment and toxic or hostile work environments. So bystander intervention, which Stapleton and others are beginning to develop for workplaces, is designed to help everyone find their voice and give them tools to speak up.

It’s all about building a sense of community. “Bystander intervention is not about approaching women as victims or potential victims, or men as perpetrators, or potential perpetrators” she said. “Rather, it’s leveraging the people in the environment to set the tone for what’s acceptable and what’s not acceptable behavior.”

At the most fundamental level, bystander interventions could begin — long before an incident of harassment — with workers having non-threatening, informal conversations in unstressed moments about how to treat each other, how they can help each other do their jobs or make their days better, and practice giving positive feedback. Normalizing talking about behavior and defining respectful behaviors everyone agrees on may make it easier for coworkers to see and give negative feedback if a worker later crosses a line,  Fran Sepler, who for 30 years has worked as a consultant, trainer, and investigator on workplace harassment prevention, told me in an interview. “So when a co-worker tells an offensive joke, it’s easier to say, ‘Remember how we talked, and we all agreed about what’s OK to say at work? That’s not it.’”

In testimony before the EEOC, Sepler suggested organizations create “feedback rich” environments, where middle managers are trained to respond to complaints and issues in an emotionally intelligent way, and where people feel comfortable speaking up and listening, no matter the issue.

In campus settings, bystanders are trained to recognize when a sexual assault may be imminent and intervene by, for instance, disrupting the environment — turning the lights on at a party, or turning the music off — defusing the situation, with humor perhaps, distracting or interrupting a potential perpetrator, drawing a potential target away, or drawing others in.

But disrupting sexual harassment in the workplace requires a very different set of tools. “Too often people let things slide, concerned that if they get involved, it might affect their own career aspirations,” Alberto Rodríguez. supervising attorney for the New York City Commission on Human Rights, told me.

Because careers and reputations can be on the line, Sepler suggests considering a matrix of questions before acting: “Can I have an impact? Is it safe? What is the best strategy given the culture of the organization and my level of influence?”

Bystanders in the workplace can defuse harassing or offensive language or situations with humor, she said, or verbal or nonverbal expressions of disapproval. They can interrupt a situation by changing the subject, or inserting themselves into the situation. “If it’s the first time you hear someone say something offensive, you might try humor as a way of getting their attention, making a caustic remark, or saying, ‘What year is this? 1970?’ as a way of getting their attention,” Sepler said. Even so, she cautioned that bystanders must weigh whether the colleague has the reputation for being a jerk. Another option bystanders could consider is having a conversation after the fact, when tensions have cooled, laying out why the behavior was offensive.

For a harassing boss or someone who holds power over your career or livelihood, where direct confrontation could be riskier, defusion, distraction, or interruption are still possible tools for bystanders in the moment. And after the fact, bystanders can also seek out a supervisor or influencer, make a report, or help a target make a report.

At a minimum, bystanders can always show support to targets, who often feel isolated, humiliated, diminished, and alone after a harassing incident. “Going to someone and saying, ‘I saw how they were treating you. I didn’t like it. Is there anything I can do to help?’ Or, ‘It’s not your fault, let’s go talk with human resources.’ That might be all you can do,” Sepler said. “That’s not nothing.”",
"Whether you're the hiring manager or the person interviewing, you'll need to a put a lot of weight into interview questions. If you don't ask the right questions -- or give solid answers -- the interview will be a total waste of everyone's time.

There are plenty of ""gotcha"" questions that intend to catch candidates off guard and see how you perform under stress. Others aim to shed light on personality traits, like Barbara Corcoran's favorite question to weed out complainers.

But really, the most valuable interview questions are those that can shed light on a candidate's emotional intelligence. Can they handle their emotions? Can they deal with different types of personalities? Even in the face of conflict and competing opinions, can they navigate interpersonal relationships to get things done?

In a survey of 800 people who have been responsible for conducting interviews, NetQuote explored which interview questions they valued most. Out of 14 possible questions, 69 percent of the hiring managers surveyed said one question was the most important: Tell me about a time you managed a conflict.

You'll notice this isn't even really a question. But it does provide enlightening answers into how a candidate works with different types of people.

Because no work environment is perfect. No matter how well-qualified you are for a job or how wonderful the workplace culture, conflict will inevitably arise. Knowing how to work with teammates in challenging situations is key to successful outcomes.

No matter what your level, you need an answer

It doesn't matter if you're not in a management position and it's not your ""job"" to resolve problems between other people. The conflict you share doesn't need to be a huge one that affected the entire team or workplace.

Talking about a time you butt heads with a colleague works perfectly. Of course, you should also share how you were ultimately able to find a way to work together despite your disagreement. Could you see where the other person was coming from, even if you didn't agree with their position? Were you able to articulate your own perspective with a cool head?

Learning how to read other people's emotions (and particularly your own) is a valuable skill -- inside and outside the workplace. ​",
"The stress of entrepreneurship easily pushes business owners into patterns that have a negative impact on their physical and emotional health. As a result, these bad habits also have a devastating effect on the health of your business, so don't put off breaking them for any longer.

This is not the way to keep your energy up. Many studies confirm the health risks associated with energy drinks, which are mostly attributed to their high sugar and caffeine levels. The risks range from mental health problems in the form of anxiety and stress to increased blood pressure, obesity, kidney damage, fatigue, stomachaches, and irritation. Energy drinks can also contribute to risk-seeking behavior, such as substance misuse and aggression.

Even if you exercise for 30-minutes a day it does not offset the risks associated with sitting for long periods of time. Sitting for too long can lead to obesity, unhealthy blood sugar levels and type 2 diabetes, increased risk of heart disease, and general inflammation in the body.

Did you know that over 6000 fatal car accidents per year are attributed to sleep deprivation on the part of the driver? Long-term sleep deprivation leads to less active immunity protection cells called natural killer cells, which play a major role in the host-rejection of both tumors and virally infected cells. The list of physical health ramifications associated with loss of sleep is long, but entrepreneurs are most immediately frustrated by the effect on cognitive performance. From word function to poor decision making, sleep deprivation over time can and will have a negative impact on your business.

Entrepreneurship is a lonely journey and working from home doesn't help. There are clear linkages between social isolation and the cardiovascular system, neuroendocrine system, and cognitive functioning. It also leads to depression, cognitive decline, and sleep problems.

5. Checking the cell phone too often (especially at night).

Harvard researchers found that blue light can drastically influence your sleep schedules (by up to three hours). Some studies indicate that blue light prevents the restorative REM sleep, adding to the sleep deprivation problem. Eye strain causes headaches, which in turn limit your ability to concentrate and function at 100 percent.

Most researchers say it takes between 21 days and one month to break a bad habit. Methods like the Emotional Freedom Techniques can easily move you through them in much less time. Entrepreneurs usually possess a very strong will; strong enough to stop a bad habit simply by deciding it's time to stop. You can do this.",None
"Google employees are planning to walk out on Thursday to protest the handling of sexual harassment allegations at the organization. Walking out will send a strong message that sexual harassment will not be tolerated at the tech giant. Although Google has been making efforts to improve its sexual harassment prevention, hopefully the walkout will teach Google a few important lessons. Namely, employees are not okay with protecting star performers from allegations, or worse, giving payouts to employees who are under investigation for sexual misconduct.

It’s getting to be a common occurrence—organizations think they’re indebted to their star performers and see these stars as irreplaceable. When misconduct allegations surface against these stars, they are likely to being ignored or kept secret. Take NBC's Matt Lauer and Fox News' Roger Ailes, for example. It was only after the allegations became public that their organizations took action.

Google is no exception to this trend, making efforts to protect its own star employees. A $90 million payout was given to Andy Rubin, the star creator of the Android mobile software, after he was asked to resign when credible harassment allegations surfaced. The allegations remained under wraps until a New York Times report was released last week.

According to the Times, Rubin was having an extramarital affair with another Google employee, and she says Rubin coerced her into performing oral sex in a hotel room in 2013 (Rubin denies the allegations). The Times report also claims that two other Google execs who departed after accusations of sexual misconduct also received million-dollar payouts.

Another Google star who faced allegations according to the Times report was Richard DeVaul. DeVaul was employed by Google’s parent company, and held the title “Director of Rapid Evaluation and Mad Science,” the division responsible for experimental, futuristic projects. The allegations against DeVaul resulted from a job interview with a prospective employee, Star Simpson. During the interview, Simpson said that DeVaul asserted that he and his wife were “polyamorous” and invited Simpson to join him at the Burning Man festival the following week.  Simpson went to Burning Man – and brought her mother along too.  DeVaul invited Simpson to remove her shirt (she declined) and offered her a back rub.

Simpson was not hired by Google and later reported the incident. DeVaul remained employed at Google until the allegations surfaced in the Times last week (DeVaul left Google this Tuesday, without a payout).

Yet another Google star, David Drummond, disclosed a consensual relationship with Google employee Jennifer Blakely.  Blakely worked in the legal department with Drummond and reported to one of Drummond's deputies.  When Google learned of the relationship, they transferred Blakely from the legal department to sales, and she quit a year later.  Drummond who faced no repercussions from the relationship is now the chief legal officer for Google’s parent company.

Why do organizations think their stars are beyond reproach? It’s self-perpetuating. Since the stars are in charge of making the contributions, then of course it seems like they are contributing the most. If the stars were to leave, it seems like the progress would cease. But that’s just not true. Nobody is irreplaceable.

In Google’s defense, the Rubin incident occurred in 2013, and the payout was given in 2014, a lifetime ago in terms of #MeToo and public awareness of sexual harassment. The other incidents also occurred prior to the #MeToo movement. More recently, Google has taken some positive steps that indicate change may be afoot.

Support from top management is key to bringing about any change, and, in a bold move, Google CEO Sundar Pichai pledged support for the employee walkout on Thursday. In an email sent to all Google employees, and obtained by Axios, Pichai pledged to “make sure managers are aware of the activities planned for Thursday and that you have the support you need.” The organization is not in denial, but is actually in support of the employees walking out. That’s a great sign that the employees are being heard.

While it may seem ridiculous that payouts were ever given to those accused of harassment, Pichai also indicated that payouts to harassers have ceased. In the same company-wide email, Pichai wrote, “Over the past two years, we have terminated 48 people, including 13 senior managers and above, for sexual harassment. None of these people received an exit package. And to clarify: in that time, we have also not provided any exit packages to executives who departed voluntarily in the course of a sexual harassment investigation.”  Although it’s an obvious and long-overdue step to halt seven- or eight-figure payments to harassers, it’s yet another step in the right direction.

In 2015, Google also instituted new rules governing sexual and romantic relationships. These rules require all of Google's vice presidents and senior vice presidents to disclose any relationship with an employee, even if they don't work in the same department or have any other potential conflict. In general, over 40% of employees engage in office romance at some point in their careers, yet very little effort is spent teaching employees how to appropriately engage in a romantic relationship with a coworker. I believe Google's disclosure rules should be in place for all employees, and they are a great step in the right direction for Google.

Despite these positive efforts, tomorrow's planned walkout is a sign Google still has a long way to go to gain back the trust of its employees. Perhaps another lesson is that it will take an excellent track record with regard to harassment to regain the full trust of the workforce.

According to the New York Times, Andy Rubin’s $90 million payout has been paid in installments of about $2 million a month for four years. The last payout is due next month.  If Google really wants to make a statement about sexual harassment, they may want to consider canceling that check.

"Hyundai is finally hitting a sweet spot that would have been hard to imagine just a couple of years ago: SUV sales now represent about half of the brand's U.S. sales volume. Led by a new version of its mid-sized Santa Fe and a refreshed version of its compact Tucson utility, Hyundai's SUV sales in September grew by 17 percent over a year earlier as the automaker finally seems to have put its biggest long-time weakness -- an over-reliance on sedans at the expense of utility vehicles -- behind it.

Hyundai also has begun supporting the new Santa Fe with a TV-advertising campaign that demonstrates how the vehicle's capabilities suit the millennial families who are depicted driving it: plenty of flexible cargo space, for instance; a dual-row panoramic sunroof so the kids can see the natural splendor of America as they drive through it; and safety features that, in turn, keep the family from running into a moose (Forward Collision-Avoidance Assist) and also prevent a young boy from having a parked Santa Fe's driver's-side passenger door ripped off its hinges by a passing car (Safe Exit Assist).

""We've got every base covered now,"" Dean Evans, Hyundai's chief marketing officer, told me. ""This is the year of the SUV for us.""

Sales of Santa Fe are a bit behind last year's levels as Hyundai continues to fill retail pipelines with the new version. Tucson sales are vastly outstripping year-ago levels as the overhauled model has moved into second place behind the Elantra sedan in Hyundai's ranking of best-selling vehicles.

""Santa Fe is a combination of a rugged vehicle and a family hauler, which is what this segment needs,"" Evans said. ""And with its Facelift, Tucson is in a sweet spot in the market too.""

Santa Fe accompanies six or seven passengers and is available in all-wheel drive, per its new advertisements that feature some off-roading -- and per expectations of millennial consumes. It's driven by a 3.3-liter V6 engine that yields 290 horsepower, and a six-speed automatic transmission. Handling and ride comfort are of the quality you'd expect from a car-based crossover, though Santa Fe still provides good human and cargo capacity. The second row feels roomy, and the seats recline and move back and forth, a rare feature in mid-size SUVs of any sort. The third row -- like most in the segment -- is tight for adults.

Hyundai is hailing an award for the 2019 Santa Fe of a spot on the new Ward's 10 Best UX list, a competition that drills deeply into user experiences in driver-assist technologies, connectivity, navigation, voice-activated systems and intuitive controls.

Meanwhile, Tucson is boasting of a lot of features for the money, including a power driver seat, heated front seats, and a 7-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto standard on all but the base trim. At the top of the Tucscon trim list, Limited, the vehicle includes a panoramic sunroof, leather upholstery, ventilated seats, LED headlights and a navigation system. Tucson also is roomy for its class, including considerable back-seat space for adults.

Evans promised more news on the SUV front for Hyundai, including introduction next year of a large SUV -- ""it's a seven-seater and it's a bad-boy"" vehicle, he said -- and also a new model smaller than Kona. Itsclineup now also includes Kona Electric and the Ioniq hybrid in the electric-vehicle department.

""Gas prices up or down,"" Evans said, ""we're really leveraged well right now across the board for whatever happens. Before we had gasoline-powered sedans; now we've got multiple body types and multiple power trains across multiple segments.""",
"I was at a dinner recently and a couple of people at the table were bemoaning the extent to which businesses have had to adapt to millennial employees. In the good old days, they argued, young people learned by getting browbeaten, whereas kids these days require beer on tap, ping-pong tables and an overly sensitive work atmosphere. Millennial bashing, I countered, was counterproductive. Top companies require top talent, and like it or not, they need millennials to succeed. Adapt or die.

With that said, if you are part of the anti-millennial movement, there is some good news. Before you know it, millennials will no longer the be the most valued members of the workforce. It is only a matter of time before companies channel their focus toward wooing the best of Generation Z. In fact, that time has already come for many businesses, particularly those driven by recent college graduates.

Comprised of individuals born roughly between 1995 and 2010, Generation Z ranges from grade schoolers to workers ready for their first promotion. Some are learning how to drive, others are driving tanks in war zones. Some are learning basic math, others are building the technology that underlies integral daily applications. While Gen Z is far from a homogeneous group, there are commonalities among those who compose the post-millennial generation that leaders should understand:

We are all, to some extent, a product of our environments, and members of Generation Z have watched their parents weather extreme market cycles. Things were humming along before the Great Recession hit, but when it did, many Gen Zers experienced lifestyle changes as their parents had to downsize. Before too long, things were booming again, but having witnessed an extreme downturn, the next collapse is never out of sight. Compounded by growing up in a post 9/11 world, with America in a continued state of war abroad and political tumult at home, in the eyes of Generation Z the only certainty is uncertainty.

The educational path that used to be taken for granted -- get good grades in high school, get into a good college, go to graduate school -- has been disrupted. When the cost of attending a private university is $70,000 a year, you do not need have a Ph.D. in math to understand that without significant financial support, whether from family members, academic scholarships and/or the government, the price of a traditional education is overwhelmingly burdensome debt.

Thus, when assessing members of Generation Z and their life decisions, understand the context in which those decisions were made. Recognize that job applicants from Gen Z may be looking for something more stable and secure than what millennials want or need. And do not dismiss candidates who lack the sterling academic credentials that may have been a prerequisite up until now. Very talented people are and will be taking alternative paths.

Perhaps no context is more important to understanding Generation Z than the outsized role of technology in driving fundamental behavior. Gen Z is the first truly technology native generation; while millennials grew up with the internet, Gen Zers have grown up with smartphones, social networks, selfies and dating apps. Attention spans have become even shorter and aptitude at multitasking has accelerated. Members of Generation Z are used to information on demand and, in turn, can make more informed and better decisions. They are more independent, more adaptable and more adept at leveraging available resources. After all, we live in a technology-driven world and Generation Z is the group most comfortable with tech.

Rather than decrying the interconnectivity between Gen Zers and technology and complaining about shortened attention spans and dependency on gadgets, leaders should embrace those among us who possess the skills that will be most needed in the future and co-opt the technology fluency that is a hallmark of Generation Z.

The rapid advancements in technology we have enjoyed in recent years have also spurred pronounced entrepreneurial activity. It is easier than ever to start a business, as technology and our fluency in it has chopped down what used to be a significant set of barriers to entry. Want to create an entity but you do not have a legal background or the budget to hire a lawyer? Get on LegalZoom or one of its many competitors. Want to build a website but you do not know how to program? Go on Squarespace or one of the many platforms like it. Too young to be taken seriously in a face-to-face meeting because you just started shaving and your voice cracks? On the internet, you can be ageless, faceless and voiceless and still crush it.

Or, you can embrace your youth and thrive. Gen Zers have grown up in an extraordinarily entrepreneurial era and have participated in it at historic rates. Kids no longer need to sell Girl Scout cookies or lemonade to make a buck. They can become social media influencers, create online consulting businesses or even build SaaS products. Schools are increasingly integrating entrepreneurship into educational curriculums, and employers should recognize that members of Generation Z are generally better aware and capable of monetizing their skills than employees of generations past.

Leaders should embrace this phenomenon by steering Gen Zers toward intrapreneurial opportunities. Capitalize on their entrepreneurial instincts and know-how of Generation Z by providing an entrepreneurial environment, more flexibility and leeway and the resources and backing of your company and experience. Embrace the coming wave and take advantage of what Generation Z has to offer.",
"Surprising as it may be, China is pulling down the rest of Asia. A slowing Chinese economy is impacting the overall trade numbers of IMF’s emerging economies & developing Asia category, which comprises of thirty Asian nations such as Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Philippines and India. A bigger shocker is however the fact that Asian trade would have grown faster without China.

To put things into perspective, if the economic powerhouse is to be excluded from the trade calculations, Emerging Asian exports and imports would have recorded a 13% and 16% growth in the year 2017. Including China, these figures go down to 11.4% and 14.7%, respectively.

This is indeed abnormal because not long ago, China single handedly made Asian numbers look outstanding. While much of Asia is still import dependent and runs a significant trade deficit, negative current account balance has never been recorded since 2002. Without China, the picture changes drastically as current account balance remains negative by a huge margin over a 13-year period. However, things are changing now as Asia’s burgeoning trade deficit is not being effectively counterbalanced by China anymore. At $181.4 billion, the country’s trade balance is expected to be lowest since 2011 by this yearend; this is considering the fact that China’s share in Emerging Asian trade has now declined to 56.7%, lowest in six years.

The year 2015 can be considered the peak of Chinese trade. The year saw China’s current account surplus breach the $350 billion threshold, recording a growth of over 60% compared to the previous year. During this year, the entire Emerging Asian region recorded a surplus of $329 billion as well. Conversely, when the Chinese numbers are not considered, this surplus turned into a deficit of nearly $28 billion for Emerging Asia.

Post 2015, considering the years 2016 and 2017, China’s surplus declined to $234 billion and is expected to hit a sub $200 billion level this year. This results in further deterioration in overall Emerging Asian terms of trade as deficit will widen to nearly $129 billion this year.

While considering the economic expansion of the region, stark realities cannot be ignored either. The phenomenal growth of China over the years is an important component of Asia’s trade prowess. Between the years 2012 and 2014, Emerging Asia’s growth in current prices averaged 9.2% along with China but declined to 3.8% without the latter. What this means is that China added 5.4 percentage points to the Asian growth story. From then on however, there has been a divergence of sorts and Emerging Asia seems to be doing better than it did along with China. Comparing the same numbers between 2015 and 2018, there is a reversal, as Emerging Asia grew by just 6.1% while including China in its growth average. Nevertheless, without the Chinese numbers, this growth number increases to 7.3% on average. China is therefore taking away nearly a percentage point from Asia’s growth print.

One might argue that Chinese trade numbers are impacted because of increased competition from other countries as well as reorientation of its own economy from external to domestic consumption. In hindsight though, given the robust scale that the Chinese economy has acquired over the years, there is no real competition. Even the global growth has been very strong recently and the accompanied consumption demand should have ideally pulled up Chinese trade numbers consistently.

There is also a possibility that other Asian countries have in a way decoupled from the Chinese value chain. After all, the legendary electronics highway that spans between the semiconductor factories of Taiwan and high technology avenues of Seoul and Tokyo – passes through Shenzhen. Rerouting the chain would certainly disrupt set norms considering the fact that almost 65% of Asia’s trade happens within its confines and China has been at the center stage of it all.

The divergence between China and the rest of Asia is nonetheless a reality now and gives a fair bit of nuance regarding the things to come. If China is not driving Emerging Asia’s growth, then who is? Contributing 56.7% to the overall trade quantum, China remains the doyen of Asia but its falling share has to be taken into considering as well. Bearing in mind this reality, repercussions pertaining to the US-China trade war, China’s reducing trade surplus and global commodity volatility suddenly become even more pronounced for Asia now. Even though it is clear that China will continue playing a leading role in forthcoming decades, there are visible signs of realignment in Asia and this cannot be ignored.",
"I approach this topic both from a personal and professional vantage point. Introverts have always been advised they require greater energy: greater energy to connect, to paint their vision, to communicate their ask and to sell their strategic plan.

Greater energy suggests introverts have a deficit. There is an inherent bias that there is something wrong with how we tell our story or convince others of the merit of our ideas. This is a misnomer that needs to be corrected. It isn’t less energy, it's different energy. Introverts are very impactful. What needs to be understood is that introverts make decisions, solve problems, inspire teams and execute in a different manner.

Introverts like to reflect, gather data, consider all contingencies and identify risks or liabilities. This takes time and careful consideration. It is the process of evaluation prior to execution that is often underestimated.

There are many introverts within organizations who have impact and influence. They are important decision makers: change agents who do positively impact the trajectory of an organization.

There are times when I am asked by introverts how to ensure they are heard. Here are common statements that leaders who are introverts most often make:

“I worry my point is not relevant.”

“What if I say something stupid?”

“There are lots of smart people in the room.”

“I don’t have all the data.”

Successful leaders are not all extroverts nor are they all charismatic in the traditional sense. Many introverts are thought disruptors who have been able to transform a culture, bring in new revenue streams and improve shareholder value. They exert influence in very different but equally impactful ways.

So let’s dive right in as I list key strategies that you, as an introvert, can successfully employ to make a difference.

1. Choose your seat wisely. When you enter a room, select a seat next to the senior leader or executive you want to influence. Spend time getting to know that leader both personally and professionally. Once you bond, they will be able to help syndicate your message.

2. Have a point of view. Make sure you have thought about what your perspective is and be prepared to articulate that in a manner that is bold and confident. You do not need to have a 100% degree of certainty. After doing your due diligence, trust the data and rely on your sound business judgment.

3. Anticipate pushback. Think in advance what might be controversial or a hard sell. In doing so, you can prepare for how you might respond.

4. Know unique drivers. Be strategic and think about your stakeholders, what motivates them and how you must appeal to their needs. This will maximize your chance of success in getting what you want.

5. Get early buy-in. You cannot single-handedly make a change. In advance of your formal presentation, meet with your constituents and get their buy-in. Meeting with them one-on-one is beneficial. They will be important influencers.

6. Secure viral carriers. You will need stakeholders who will be keen to help sell your vision. Align yourself with like-minded leaders who are willing to act as catalysts for change.

Introverts have an equally important place on teams and as leaders who can effect change. Organizations that understand, reinforce and promote diversity of leadership styles will always reap a great return. As an introvert, own your style of communication, and through that ownership, you will be sure to make a key difference.",
"There are countless articles out there written by leaders, for leaders, advising us on how to best maximize our vacation time, or giving us recommendations on what to do with our free time in order to improve. I've even written a few myself. But most of them tend to focus on solo travel or business travel. What about family travel?

More specifically, I'm referring to traveling with your parents. As adults, we don't do this much. We either go home to visit our parents, or we travel to see them with the whole family. But traveling with just your parents can give you amazing insight into why you are the way you are, why you were raised a certain way, and what you want for the future.

Recently, I spent a couple trips with my parents. I was in Peru speaking at an event and my parents joined me on an Inca Trail trek. Then, shortly after, I was in Chicago with my parents for a couple days, bracing the wind and the cold. I learned so much and the perspective change these trips gave to me motivated me to share some of these learnings. Here's how traveling with your parents can be beneficial.

They know you better than anyone.

Your parents have known you since you were born; no one else can say that. They watched you grow from a helpless infant into a child, then a teenager, then an adult. They've watched the evolution of your goals, hopes, dreams, and values closer than anyone else has. Traveling, meanwhile, teaches you more about everyone--even your parents, and even (especially) yourself.

Traveling with your parents, then, can help you revisit that progression. What did you want to be when you grew up? What has always been important to you? What used to be important, but no longer is? Reflecting on these questions can help you figure out how to best proceed to get to where you want to be.

You can learn about them (and thus, about you).

Your view of your parents has likely changed as you've grown into adulthood. As we get older, and begin to view our parents through the same lens with which we view our friends or colleagues, we understand them better. Traits that may have seemed inexplicable when we were children suddenly make sense as we gain a better knowledge of day-to-day adulthood, and, if you have children of your own, the trials and tribulations of parenting. They also may share things with you that they didn't when you were growing up.

Learning more about the people who raised us helps us to learn more about the way we were raised, the traits we may have inherited from them, and why we are the way we are. Similarly, traveling highlights everyone's positive and negative traits. If you can point out a flaw in your parents and form an opinion on how to improve that flaw, then perhaps you can do the same for yourself. Likewise, recognizing your parents' strengths can help you to acknowledge your own, and further, how to highlight them. Knowing your strengths and weaknesses is essential to achieving your dreams.

You can see a future you.

This one isn't always fun, but it it extremely useful. Observing people a generation older than you, up close and personally (while traveling, for example), can help you figure out what you want and don't want for your own future. Maybe one of your parents didn't take great care with their health and is now suffering the consequences. Or maybe they stayed in a job they disliked and wish that they hadn't. You can learn from the mistakes or regrets of others (which is probably something they taught you growing up, anyway).

It doesn't all have to be negative, though. Maybe one of your parents took up a hobby they love much later in life, or invested their money smartly and are now reaping the benefits. You can also learn from their triumphs and figure out how you might like to spend your time, money, and energy when you're their age, and what you need to do in the meantime to make that happen.

If you have lost your parents, were raised by someone else, or are estranged, you can still learn from people with a few years on you. Consider spending serious quality time with an older mentor, sibling, or friend. Even if it's not an extended vacation, a weekend or even a day trip can teach you a lot about someone, and help you see your own reflection in them. And as leaders and doers, we should always be reflecting, so that we can always be progressing.",
"Traveling will help you understand culture and how to change it. Your big idea, however, often comes from your own unique perspective. Bill Gates was exposed to computers very early, so, as Malcolm Gladwell famously described in his best-seller Outliers, Gates knew the need Microsoft could fill. Similarly, my years researching and writing about intimacy and technology, like in my book Porn & Pong, helped me realize the need for my popular app Cuddlr.

For TED Fellow DeAndrea Salvador, she paid attention to how her relatives in Charlotte, North Carolina kept the oven open during wintertime. It just seemed normal. It wasn't until she got older that she asked - and it became clear that they turned on the oven to keep the house warm. Using the oven was cheaper than using the house's heat and it was worth it to them, despite the inherent danger.

Now, she founded the non-profit RETI (Renewable Energy Transit Initiative), dedicating her life to helping others not have to make that choice between safety and protection. She says, ""Energy poverty, also known as high energy burdens or energy insecurity refers to a person or family's inability to afford energy for basic necessities... [often] when someone spends greater than 6% of their income on energy. Much of the issue of high energy burdens is tied to income level.""

Use your unique view to contribute

RETI focuses on energy education for lower-income communities, including smart efficiency techniques and government programs. It all originated from Salvador listening to her community, she told me:

I first got curious about high energy burdens around 5 years ago. This stemmed from hearing conversations among my communities (specifically my grandparents and neighbors) about keeping their home at a comfortable temperature. Having done some research and after having the conversations, I learned that millions of people were affected nationally and internationally by this issue. But also during my research, I saw more and more evidence that showed by creating pathways to resources and advocating and sharing information, it can not only help alleviate high energy burdens but result in health improvements as well.

If it wasn't for the family background and objective observing, then Salvador and RETI wouldn't be making a bigger impact to the communities that need it. Diversity is your strength, from idea to execution, as I've shared in a previous column:

If the average founder is likely to scratch their own itch, then successful founders will need a diverse team - if not be part of an underrepresented group themselves - to find niches that are ripe for disruption.

Those of us that don't fit into the Silicon Valley mold aren't at a disadvantage and, in fact, may be at a serious advantage. Keep that in mind as you face friction in making your change in the world.",
"Sometimes we're looking for a discount on our business travels. Other times we need to reach our destination early the next day for a business meeting. Either way, we've all likely experienced a sleepless red-eye flight.

Although it may seem impossible, you can get some shut-eye on a red eye with the right approach. I've had my share of struggles too and it's only through painful experiences that I've found a few solutions.

Here are some strategies you can implement before and during your flight so you can sleep and reduce the chances of experiencing jet lag.

When booking your seat on a red-eye flight, make sure that the seat you pick corresponds with how you sleep. If you're a side sleeper, then it'll be in your best interest to book a window seat. Even better, be sure to book the side of the plane that you sleep on at home.

Once you're on the plane, you can then prop a pillow or rolled up jacket on the window. If you've mastered the art of sleeping upright, then you'll be comfortable booking a window or an aisle seat.

Your sleep position is only one component that you should consider when trying to get the most out of your flight. If you tend to get up frequently through the night to use the restroom, an aisle seat is a better option.

Avoid booking your seat at the front or back of the plane. The front of the plane is usually where families and their infants sit while the rear of the plane is where the flight attendants and restroom is. There's nothing worse than falling asleep only to be frequently woken up by restroom activity.

You can also use a credit card to get an upgrade to business or first class. Use an airline miles credit card for an upgrade that can make the rest of your travels much easier to manage. You'll be able to get more comfortable for sleep.

Now that you've booked the right seat, you'll need to pack some necessities. Travel pillows have come a long way and aren't so bulky anymore. I recommend a travel pillow and a large scarf or sweater if you tend to get cold.

I've invested in noise-canceling headphones to block out loud people and the general noises that come with the territory of an airplane. If you have a pair, you'll definitely need to pack it. Though, if that's out of your budget, a pair of earplugs will suffice.

You'll also want to block out all light. A high-quality eye mask is an investment you'll thank yourself for later. Be sure to practice wearing it while at home, otherwise you may have trouble with it on your flight.

I can't sleep at night when I'm at home in the comfort of my bed if my clothes are tight. I need loose, breathable fabric to sleep comfortably. It's the same if I'm on a red-eye.

While you don't have to wear your pajamas (though some airlines like Emirates and Qatar Airlines provide pajamas, depending on what class you are flying), you don't want to wear anything that'll restrict your movements and make it hard for you to get comfortable.

If you know that you won't be able to sleep, then consider drinking an herbal tea to relax. Avoid alcohol or drinks with any caffeine. Even decaf coffee can prevent a good night's sleep.

If you must, consider taking melatonin. You'll need to take it 30 minutes to an hour before the plane takes off for a good night's rest -- but be sure to do your research and follow the recommended dosage amount.

Be aware that sleeping pills and herbal remedies may have a strong effect that lasts for the coming days. I've taken natural supplements and ended up being more tired the next day. Know what you are taking and do a trial run if possible. Let someone know where you are, in the off-chance you oversleep and miss a meeting.",
"Sports are big business, so it makes sense that businesses can learn much from the world of sports. From the corporate room to the locker room, sport leaders have to overcome the same challenges and utilize the same skills as many entrepreneurs.

So no matter if you are trying to build a new team, facing stiff competition, or facing ongoing setbacks, you often can find guidance and wisdom from people in the tough-and-tumble world of professional and elite-level sports. These are some of my favorite books from sport gurus who have shown me what it takes to compete, succeed, and win.

1. Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game by Michael Lewis.

The story about how cash strapped Oakland A's general manager Billy Beane relied on deep stats and analytics to compete against the big payroll teams is well known. It's been argued that Beane didn't revolutionize how baseball is run, but he recognized that to survive in a small market, he needed to change his thinking and challenge the status quo.

Beane questioned how things were always done and looked at different angles until he found something that worked for his unique situation. And then he wasn't afraid to try it. This is a lesson every business person always needs to hear--we can never get comfortable in our businesses because there will always be competition from new technology, new competitors, and new market dynamics.

2. The Captain Class: The Hidden Force That Creates the World's Greatest Teams by Sam Walker.

What do the greatest sports teams of all time have in common? Walker set out to explore that question with in-depth profiles of 16 of the top sports teams, from the Boston Celtics' 1956-69 dynasty to the 1999 U.S. Women's World Cup champions to the Collingwood Magpies from 1920s Australian rules football.

His interviews revealed several shared traits, such as extreme focus during tough competition, when to lead from behind, and how to regulate emotions, to name but a few. Just like businesses, every sports team has unique challenges and goals. However, the teams that stand apart are experts at recognizing what they need and implementing the right strategies. For me, I learned about the power of saying ""no,"" so I don't overextend myself and can keep my eyes focused on a specific goal.

3. They Call Me Coach by John Wooden with Jack Tobin.

John Wooden, the great UCLA basketball coach who won 10 national championships over a 12-year period, wrote many books about leadership and success. His code was simple: preparation, work ethic, and integrity. But in this book, Wooden digs deeper into his coaching philosophy and how he built his ""Pyramid of Success,"" which he used to mold new talent year after year and keep his players motivated.

There are times when you have to be a teacher and mentor and instill your approach to business in others. Something I learned here was the importance of being an active listener, which in turn helps you become a better leader. If you preach, rather than mentor, people will not rise to be their best selves.

4. Playbook for Success: A Hall of Famer's Business Tactics for Teamwork and Leadership by Nancy Lieberman.

This book is for women looking for the tools they need to compete and win in the game of business. Lieberman has blazed a trail through the ranks of professional basketball, first with the WNBA (as a player and coach), and eventually the NBA, where she became  the first female head coach in the NBA's Development League before landing her current job as assistant coach for the Sacramento Kings.

Lieberman's secret for success? She created (and stuck with) her own playbook for success. She fine-tuned the sports-related skills she learned from basketball that women also need in business, such as creating a champion's mindset, recognizing your strengths and weakness, and the power of teamwork.

In my experience, a lack of self-confidence can often get in the way of success for many women as they grow their careers. To overcome this, it's important to have the courage to put ourselves out there, believe in our capabilities, and go for what we want. I found that Lieberman's lesson to build a champion mindset is a great mantra to repeat in your head at times when you need it most.",
"Absurdly Driven looks at the world of business with a skeptical eye and a firmly rooted tongue in cheek.

When a company claims its new product is The Ultimate, it's wise to be skeptical.

Yet here comes McDonald's staggering yet again into the 21st. century with an idea few imagined likely.

""McDonald's has been on a food journey,"" reveals the chain in a new press release.

Well, if it has, it's been walking very slowly.

As chains such as In-N-Out and Shake Shack served fresh beef, McDonald's continued being synonymous with frozen.

Until, that is, it began to realize how it was frozen in time.

Suddenly, the chain was putting fresh beef in all its Quarter Pounders.

Now, though, the utterly unthinkable. McDonald's just revealed it's experimenting with fresh chicken.

Calling its new concoctions the Ultimate Chicken Sandwich and Ultimate Chicken Tenders, McDonald's says Western Washington State is the first to enjoy the concept of non-frozen chicken.

I suspect most people rather prefer fresh chicken to a McNugget. But not everyone.

The chain is marketing these delights as Made To Order.

This is a concept which, when it was tried with the fresh beef Quarter Pounders, caused some customers to have antsy conniptions, though the problems seems to have mostly subsided.

McDonald's actually sells more chicken than beef, so there ought to be exalted excitement at the prospect that the chicken might be healthier.

Moreover, the chain is adding something even more adventurous to its chicken test:",
"In 2013, The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation launched the Bundled Payments for Care Improvement (BPCI) initiative, a program that proponents hoped could rein in health care costs by “bundling” payment for the full gamut of services that comprise an episode of care.  Bundled care for hip and knee replacement has been a dramatic with clear savings and good outcomes. However, research suggests that bundles may not work as well for other types of conditions such as heart attack. On reason is that hip and knee replacements are discrete, pre-planned events with a fairly standardized and consistent patient journey. Medical admissions follow a much more fragmented and much less coherent course. Bundled could be a powerful policy mechanism that encourages hospitals to create standardized clinical pathways and provide more coordinated, efficient care for medical conditions.

In 2013, The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation launched the Bundled Payments for Care Improvement (BPCI) initiative, a program that proponents hoped could rein in health care costs by “bundling” payment for the full gamut of services that comprise an episode of care. The model certainly seemed like a good bet, as it would reward hospitals for reducing the cost of soup-to-nuts care for any of 48 conditions and penalize them for overruns. Indeed, bundled care for hip and knee replacement has been a dramatic success with clear savings and no increase in emergency department visits, readmissions, or 30-day mortality.

However, our research suggests that bundles may not work as well for other types of conditions. That doesn’t necessarily mean that the problem lies with the bundled payment model itself. Rather, we think it could lie with the fragmented nature of the patient journey in a dysfunctional system, which is exposed by medical bundles’ lack of impact. But before delving into that diagnosis, let’s step back and look at the research.

With our colleagues John Orav and Jie Zheng, we used Medicare claims from 2013 through 2015 to identify admissions for the five most common medical conditions covered under the Medicare bundled payment initiative: heart attack, heart failure, pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and sepsis. We calculated the costs of each “episode” — the hospitalization plus all costs in the 90 days post discharge — for hospitals that joined BPCI as well as hospitals that didn’t join (our control group). We then looked to see whether costs dropped more in the BPCI hospitals than the control hospitals after the program started. Overall, the average Medicare payment per episode of care across the five conditions — about $24,000 — dipped just a few hundred dollars, a statistically insignificant amount. In addition, there was no difference in the change over time based on whether hospitals were or weren’t participating in the program. We also didn’t find any differences in clinical complexity, length of stay, emergency department use or readmission within 30 or 90 days after hospital discharge, or death within 30 or 90 days after admission between the intervention and control hospitals. In short, for these five common medical conditions, bundled payment had no impact on costs or clinical outcomes — at least in the program’s first year.

We don’t know exactly why bundles were successful for hip and knee replacements, but not for medical conditions. Perhaps all the hospitals that signed up for the hip and knee bundles were much more motivated than the hospitals that signed up for the medical bundles. Or perhaps we just need to wait longer to see an impact of bundling on a wider range of conditions.

However, we suspect that these patterns reflect the complexity and fragmentation of the patient journey for common medical conditions as a cause and shed light on not only how we might help hospitals succeed under bundles, but how we might also improve patient experience.

Hip and knee replacements are discrete, pre-planned events with a fairly standardized and consistent patient journey, from pre-operative evaluation to scheduled OR date to post-operative rehabilitation, and with a single “captain” of the ship. The surgeon performing the operation is ultimately responsible for the entirety of that patient’s clinical course. For the patient too, there is an obvious point person before the admission, during the hospitalization, and after discharge. Most patients who have had a total joint replacement could tell you the name of their surgeon even years after the procedure, often with great fondness.

Medical admissions follow an entirely different course. Consider what happens to a patient coming to the hospital with a heart failure exacerbation. She certainly did not plan the admission, and may have no pre-existing relationship with the clinician she sees in the hospital. She sees the emergency department physician who happens to be on duty that day, and depending on clinical severity, bed availability, and the call schedule of the residents and interns if she’s in a teaching hospital, could end up admitted to a general medical service, hospitalist service, cardiology service, medical intensive care unit, or cardiac intensive care unit. Her care team could change daily, including the nurses and nursing assistants. During her stay in the hospital she may see cardiologists, internists, and nephrologists, as well as physical therapists, pharmacists, social workers, and discharge planners. At discharge, she may or may not be scheduled to come back to see anyone that was involved in her inpatient care, depending on where she wishes to establish or maintain cardiovascular follow-up, and there is likely no post-discharge protocol for follow-up and rehabilitation, nor formal relationships with the nursing facility or home health agency to which she is discharged.

To improve this patient’s journey though the health care system — and increase the chance that bundled payments can help her achieve better outcomes and help the system lower its costs — we first need to understand the journey. Patterns of care are heterogeneous for medical conditions compared with discrete elective surgeries. And perhaps the overwhelming complexity and fragmentation of the patient journey for most unplanned medical admissions explains both why medical bundles are hard, and why they are so very important.

The early failure of medical bundles is a window into the disjointed, piecemeal health system most of our patients (and clinicians themselves) experience. Even the first step for hospitals electing to participate in BPCI for a medical condition — trying to figure out who needs to be around the table to discuss improving care across the clinical episode — is not an easy one.  But rather than discourage us from using bundles as a way to improve care, this complexity makes it all the more critical to use mechanisms like bundled payment programs to incent health systems to change the paradigm. Hospitals can and should design and implement standardized clinical pathways and provide more coordinated, efficient care for medical conditions, and bundling may be a powerful policy mechanism to help get us there.

The five years of experience we have had with BPCI seems like a sufficient time to have learned a lot about it. And perhaps with more time and greater incentives hospitals will be better able and more willing to make the changes needed in care delivery for medical bundles to be effective and to create a better experience for patients. But for now, we are only scratching the surface, and there is much more to learn about the use of bundling for different conditions and different patients. Indeed, bundling is just one in a series of policy innovations that Medicare and others are experimenting with to move us past traditional fee for service. The road to better policy will be long and winding.  We can only hope that on the way we will discover much about more efficient care, and most importantly, ways to both control costs and improve outcomes that matter to patients.",None
"What is personal branding and how is it different from thought leadership? Thought leadership is a strategic move aimed at showcasing your expertise in the industry. Your personal brand is what holds your thought leadership in place. It cements what you’re about in the minds of the consumer.

There are various ways in which personal branding adds value to your thought leadership efforts. Here are a few of them, as well as how to leverage your personal brand for increased consumer trust and visibility:

1. It builds your network and credibility.

With proper personal branding, you can draw people to you and build up your follower base. When people recognize you and your brand and relate to you on a personal level, they will feel more comfortable reaching out to you on social media with connection requests. This makes networking even easier. You can use your personal brand and connections to get paid speaking gigs and book deals, become a brand ambassador and connect with other business executives.

When you are building your personal brand, keep in mind that your audience should be your focus. Think about what your audience wants to read when generating content. If you are publishing in the entrepreneurship section of Forbes, for example, make sure to align your content with an entrepreneurial reader base. Currently, I write about entrepreneurship and marketing. I stay in my swim lane to ensure the content resonates with the target audience and, in doing so, build my network with readers looking for information in my area of expertise.

A personal brand can bring a business to life. When you get personal branding right, you can transform from a new entrepreneur into a trusted and knowledgeable individual in the minds of the consumer. When your personal brand grows and becomes trustworthy, the mere attachment of your name to a new business will get people’s attention. They have come to expect certain values from you and they will have no doubt that those values will be reflected in whatever new venture you associate yourself with.

Once you have grown your personal brand to a high level, you will be able to demand more money for your time and expertise. Many people who have strong personal brands take on consulting and paid speaking opportunities. For example, recently I had the pleasure of speaking to the students of Michigan State University on the importance of public relations. If you are interested in pursuing consulting, focus exclusively on your expertise. Before taking on a new client, make sure that you are an expert in that niche.

3. It adds to your confidence.

As your personal brand grows, your confidence begins to grow in both your personal and professional spheres. You now have an authentic voice in your community of interested consumers and stakeholders. As you share your values with people who are eager and willing to listen to you and adopt your ideas, your confidence and self-esteem grow to match the increased levels of trust your consumers have placed in you.

I knew that my personal brand had started to take off when I began showing up in major publications. I received a lot of positive messages from other entrepreneurs who were inspired by my articles, which boosted my confidence.

4. It opens you to new media opportunities.

When your brand grows and your audience grows alongside it, and you will have the opportunity to engage with journalists and media personnel on a whole new level. Others have become interested in what you have to say, and you can exploit this readiness to spread your message.

There are two good methods for engaging with journalists. First, dig through your favorite publications and search for staff writers. You can find their personal contact information in their bios. I have also reached out to journalists via Help A Reporter Out and have successfully landed placements for clients. When pursuing placements, remember to provide value first. Once you have an established relationship, you can ask for mentions and features.

5. It opens up new career opportunities.

When you have a personal brand that transcends your company, it is a lot easier to branch out into other career opportunities in the future. Whether or not you have long-term plans with your current company or business, the strength of your personal brand can open up new areas to explore. You can decide to consider them or not depending on where you see yourself at that moment in time.

As well, building your network around your personal brand is the number one way to get new clients. Make sure that your personal brand is serving others by providing free value in the form of information/knowledge share. When people start seeing you all over various publications, it will make you appear more credible in your field. This will help gain potential clients' trust and business.

Your personal brand is a valuable asset that, if nurtured properly, doesn’t go away. It adds value to your thought leadership and propels you into a brighter future.",
"In my years of experience as a business leader, I’ve met my fair share of complacent employees. You know how to spot them. They do the absolute bare minimum to get by. They’re focused on not getting fired and couldn’t care less about delivering exceptional customer experiences. Their poor attitude and lackluster work ethic can infect their fellow employees and lead to big lapses in productivity.

We all know that employee engagement matters. In fact, a 2013 Gallup study found a direct correlation between engagement and business outcomes. And it’s common to feel a sense of powerlessness about these underperforming employees. Talent is hard to come by, and some days it’s a good thing to simply maintain a full complement of staff (regardless of their level of motivation). But there are things to be done about this situation. For a relatively small investment of time, resources and energy, I believe business owners and leaders can spur their once-complacent employees to far greater heights of motivation, productivity and profit generation.

1. Ease up on the pressure.

It may seem counterintuitive, but I've found that one of the best things you can do to fight the complacency of your employees is to cut back on your use of performance-based pressure (such as sales-centric promotion criteria, team lectures and public shaming). Exerting emotional pressure and stress on your employees is not usually an effective way to spur them to motivated or inspired action. In fact, it’s often a great way to turn them against you and your organization. Some employees, driven to the breaking point by overuse of high-pressure tactics, might even look for opportunities to rebel or act out in ways that could hurt your company. Instead of resorting to these outdated “motivation” techniques, opt to steer employees toward wanting to perform well at work instead.

Once you’ve lifted the weight and intensity of any overly demanding expectations off the shoulders of your employees, it’s time to cultivate a culture of experimentation, play, and friendly trial and error. As demonstrated by some of the most innovative and successful companies on our planet, I believe that great ideas and game-changing customer service can come from any corner of an organization. When employees are allowed and empowered to try things out, take risks, generate off-the-wall ideas, ask “dumb” questions and get creative, they often feel excited and motivated to engage with their jobs. Work also becomes a lot more fun.

Every customer-focused, profit-generating business has a purpose in the marketplace and offers real and distinctive value for its customers. It’s your job as a leader to ensure that your employees – from frontline and call-center staff to the upper echelons of management – completely and deeply understand that purpose and value. Better yet, find ways to help your team feel and live that purpose and value. For example, at face value, our company is an online fashion retailer. But our value is also more than that: we provide a boost in mood, self-esteem and self-image, as well as a sense of belonging in a community. We help our employees understand and feel the value that they bring to people’s lives, which in turn keeps them motivated to continue delivering that value.

4. Put yourself in the employee’s shoes.

As a manager or leader, it’s easy to get caught up in the day-to-day expectations and demands of your position. You’re responsible for revenue growth, strategic planning, customer acquisition and countless other senior-level tasks. It’s easy to forget what it was like to serve in a frontline, customer-facing or junior role on a bustling team. Take a moment to place yourself in a seemingly complacent employee’s shoes, and consider the daily challenges and nuances of their stressful, sometimes thankless work. Ponder the simple but meaningful changes (such as breakfast parties, bi-annual volunteering field days, team-building games or small spot bonuses) that might completely transform that employee’s day, mood or work life. What would make a difference for you if you were in their position?

If there’s one way to make your employees feel patronized, excluded and unimportant, I believe it’s the use of conservative, stuffy and opaque corporate-speak. Today’s workforce, particularly the millennial generation and their younger counterparts, sees right through the aloof, buttoned-up messages and materials that some businesses deliver via email, meetings and break room posters. If you’re not communicating with transparency, authenticity and a sense of humor, experience tells me that you're a major step behind the times. I encourage every leader to examine their recent employee-facing communications for any hint of corporate jargon, obfuscation or paternalism. Be tough on yourself when crafting a message, and always opt for a “let’s get real” tone. If you master the casual nature of the 21st century employer-employee conversation, I believe it’s inevitable that your employee retention will improve.",
"They're the little sayings and reminders that help us keep it moving and guide our day-to-day choices.

In my three years of entrepreneurship, I've come across many mantras, and there are now a few I hold dear to my heart. Here are my top seven mantras for any creative entrepreneurs looking to endure a rough patch.

1.) Get out of your head and do the work.

Oftentimes, when we're stuck as leaders and business owners on an issue, we're blinded by our own biases and constructions. Whenever I can't figure something out (whether it's financial or directional), I ask myself what I would do if I weren't the founder, but a CEO hired for the job. Typically, when I get out of my own emotional attachment to the business and its next steps, the answer to my problem becomes a little more clear.

It can be really disheartening when we don't get the client, customer or partnership we want, but we're not meant to work with everyone. If someone can't see the value in working with you or purchasing your product, it's not the end of the world. I use these moments to reassess the kinds of clients and customers you're trying to pursue.

A business' culture begins from the top down. If I'm trying to motivate my staff to be productive and more creative, I've got to find ways to get myself to do the same. Demonstrate, don't tell.

4.) Be kind and honest about your boundaries. Speak your truth.

Collaborations go bad, new partnerships go south—it's part of doing business. When something starts to feel off, it's important that you speak up. Lean into your intuition and trust your gut. That's your body reminding you of your experience.

5.) Just because you can doesn't mean you should.

As you develop your business, you'll come across opportunity after opportunity (or you come up with idea after idea). When I can't determine which way to go, I always return to my core values and goals, then build from there.

Sometimes, we honestly just bite off more than we can chew, and we refuse to pare it down, because we believe that what we're doing is important. When I've hit a rough patch, I take a minute to figure out where I'm overdoing it. What does my team really care about? What do they need from me? What do my customers really care about? What do they need the most from my work?

7.) Fail is just your ""first attempt in learning.""

You don't know what you don't know, and you can't fault yourself for trying. When you're building a business, you're on a steep learning curve. So, I view moments of failures as opportunities to experiment. That's part of learning what works.",
"It’s official – with the clocks now turned back, the darkness setting in, and leaves falling even faster, nature is cueing us to soften into a hibernation state.

At the same time, within a week, the festive lights will start switching on across cities. One of the most famous strips, Oxford Street in London, has its official turn-on event on 6 November – marking the ‘busy’ season is well and truly ‘on’.

The polarity of this end of Autumn-come-Winter season is extreme. The busyness of year-end tends to heighten. Work schedules are loaded to fit everything in before the close of the year and social schedules ramp up.

Even in the southern hemisphere where the days are growing brighter, the busyness persists.

Yet nature’s signals are that of a phase of renewal, shedding, slowing and letting go.

Last week, if you looked into the night sky you may have noticed another cue from nature. A view that is visible from all parts of the world – the full radiant moon. One more symbol of ever-present cycles around us and transitions from one phase to the next.

For most, the subtleties of seasonal changes go unnoticed. We are tuned in instead to our growing to-do lists and instead of moving through each phase, we stay committed to the go-go-go.

There are numerous accounts of us being busier than ever – from 50% of employees now checking phones and tablets before bed through to 40% of the British workforce not even using their holiday entitlements. We are living our personal lives in a mono-phase rather than a multi-phase approach.

And our value and worthiness are being wrapped up in our busyness, with a ‘busy and overworked’ lifestyle becoming more of a ‘status symbol’ and the norm for many, regardless of performance statistics showing otherwise (we actually handle things better when we’re not so rushed).

A multi-phase approach to growth and effective performance is not new. Ancient practices like Ayurveda apply principles of the seasons to increase personal well-being and to support healthy living. Even suggesting shifts in diet and exercise at different times of the year.

Even through to business performance models such as Tuckman’s well-known Forming-Storming-Norming-Performing group development model, first developed in 1965, which illustrated the importance of all four phases for effective growth.

Whether or not you follow astrology or pay attention to what each season represents in nature, the evidence is clear: cyclical approaches to productivity are everywhere.

From nature to business to team performance it is natural to think in terms of phases and cycles when it comes to productivity and growth.

So this is not a new concept. Yet we fail to think this same way in our personal lives. Our incessant need to be ‘doing’ is against the grain of all other models – the full spectrum from ancient philosophies, to business to astrology.

In a study of high-performance habits tested with over 30,000 people from 195 countries, Brendon Burchard highlighted, even more, the significance of downtime. He says for ‘optimal productivity’:

And that achievers (aka the ones consumed by ‘busy’) choose to “power through” instead – another reason why they’re stressed and without sufficient work-life balance.

If you’re looking to improve your well-being this ‘busy’ season, taking some cues from nature and forming a cyclical approach could just be what you need. One that takes into account both speeding up and slowing down, softening and releasing, and allowing time for pause, renewal, and review.

A more sustainable approach to personal wellness values all the phases and is one of the best gifts you can give yourself at this time of year.",wellness
"Interviewing for a job while you have another job can be tricky — often you end up lying to your current employer about why you're late to work or stuffing a suit jacket under your desk so no one asks why you look so spiffy today.

And yet if you ask executives at some top tech companies, they'll tell you this whole process is ridiculous.

A growing number of tech companies say they want to know when their employees are looking at other jobs. And instead of considering the employees traitorous, they'll sometimes go out of their way to help the employees land those other roles.

Consider Netflix, famous for its culture of ""freedom and responsibility."" Its website reads: ""Knowing that other companies would quickly hire you if you left Netflix is comforting. We see occasional outside interviewing as healthy, and encourage employees to talk with their managers about what they learn in the process.""

Patty McCord, Netflix's former chief talent officer, previously told Business Insider that this openness has a number of potential benefits. For example, McCord said, interviewing can help you clarify your professional goals because you may be more honest with the hiring manager than you are with your boss. On the other hand, it can make you appreciate your current company more.

Ryan Bonnici, chief marketing officer of G2 Crowd, a platform for sharing business-software reviews, writes in the Harvard Business Review that he encourages his best employees to consider outside job offers.

According to Bonnici, this practice helps him attract and even retain top performers. One reason why, he writes, is that when great employees leave on good terms, ""out in the world, they'll be in a powerful position to speak honestly about their experiences. If they leave our company feeling good about us, they'll speak positively about the brand."" Some employees may even be inclined to return to G2 Crowd later on.

Bonnici cites the inspiration of Reid Hoffman, cofounder of LinkedIn, who writes in HBR that talking about an employee's outside job offers fosters trust and honesty in the workplace.

Jellyvision, which makes interactive benefits-communication software, has a ""graceful leaving policy"" to help both the company and its employees. As Erica Keswin details in her book ""Bring Your Human to Work,"" Jellyvision asks employees to notify the company when they start looking for a new job — and in return, the company helps the employee in their job search.

Mary Beth Wynn, Jellyvision's senior vice president of people, echoed Bonnici's sentiments in an interview with Lauren Dixon at Talent Economy: ""Maybe people shouldn't be so worried about people leaving. If you become known as a company from which people go on to do other great things, that in and of itself can be great for your culture.""

Facebook, meanwhile, makes sure that all employees have succession plans, Business Insider's Richard Feloni reported. That way, the company isn't slowed down by people changing roles or leaving the company.

Some management research lends credence to the idea that you should help your employees build fulfilling careers — even if it's not at your company.

In his book ""Superbosses,"" Dartmouth business professor Sydney Finkelstein writes that the best managers don't try to hold onto employees forever. In fact, Finkelstein argues, the way ""superbosses"" become successful themselves is by creating industry-wide networks of people who have worked for them so that they're always well-connected.

And a 2017 study, published in the Strategic Management Journal and cited in The Wall Street Journal, found that when lawyers leave their firms for promotions at high-status competitors, their former firms are subsequently perceived as more prestigious.

To be sure, the willingness to help employees move on may go hand-in-hand with other, less savory aspects of workplace culture. The Wall Street Journal recently published an article on Netflix, suggesting that many employees are in constant fear of losing their jobs. (Indeed, McCord previously told Business Insider that, if you're no longer meeting the company's needs, you may very well be ousted.)

As for Bonnici, he says he's committed to G2 Crowd employees' development above all — even his own. He writes in HBR, ""I've not only encouraged my employees to look elsewhere but also told them that I keep an eye out for potential new jobs for myself as well.""",
"One of the greatest thrills for any kid (and let's face it, many adults) is catching a foul ball at a baseball game. Believe it or not, it’s not impossible. Show up at the park early enough for batting practice or beg loud enough to a player warming up before the game, between innings or in the bullpen and there's a chance you too could get a lucky souvenir to take home.

The 11-year-old Cotter caught a foul ball one day at a Philadelphia Phillies game and, like any fan, refused to give it back - even when team officials demanded. The consequences were severe. The team had the boy arrested, not only for keeping the property but also after accusing him of sneaking in to the game without paying for his ticket. Cotter was forced to spend an entire night in jail until being freed the next day when a sympathetic judge found that it was ""entirely reasonable"" that a kid could keep a foul ball at a baseball game. And besides, the judge noted, he made a really good catch.

Before you get outraged, take note: the incident happened at the now demolished Baker Bowl in 1923 and was retold in Bill Bryson's great book ""One Summer: America, 1927"" and other books recounting the era. Ever since that incident major league baseball teams have allowed their fans to keep foul balls.

An 11-year-old being put in jail for keeping a foul ball sounds ridiculous today, doesn't it? Unfortunately, too many businesses still act like the Phillies did back in 1923. They don't let their customers take home a souvenir of their experience either. And it hurts them in the long run.

I learned this years ago when my young technology service company - which was still in a painful growth stage - had the opportunity to work with a client that could bring in hundreds of hours of much-needed chargeable time. But there was a catch.

The prospective client was still smarting from a bad experience with one of my competitors and asked me if I could rescue their project and carry on providing services.  I told them we were completely capable for the job, but, given their history, my assurances weren't enough. When asked to kick in a few days of complimentary services on a smaller project with them so that we could prove our abilities I refused. Unfortunately, I lost the job to another firm that was more than willing to demonstrate their worth at no charge to the what would then turn into a long term client for them.

Like the Phillies, I’ve since learned the error of my ways. The cost of a free baseball is peanuts as compared to the happiness it provides to the lucky fans who get a souvenir. The cost of me providing a complimentary service - or your business giving away samples, demos, test products or just free stuff - is also peanuts over the long term. The return is a happy customer who has a good experience with your firm that hopefully continues a long term relationship.

So go ahead. Give a foul ball away, or whatever it is you make. Let your fans experience the joy of working with your company. If you're good at what you do, they'll be back for plenty more.",
"For years we have been hearing that a major reason college prices are so high is that state governments, which directly subsidize public colleges, keep cutting what they spend on higher education. With that in mind, a component of many “free college” proposals we’ve been offered—and which may proliferate especially if Democrats have a good day in the midterm elections—include the federal government incentivizing states to greatly increase their subsidies to public institutions. But some new, long-term data undermine the “cheap states” theory.

As I have indicated with some basic revenue analysis, and others have shown with a deeper dive, the theory does not hold up well under scrutiny. And now the State Higher Education Executive Officers Association (SHEEO), a group that has long helpfully published data on public college finances, has posted longer term data than they have made readily available—and I have used—in the past. Now going back to 1980, the data reinforce the conclusion that public institutions have been increasing revenue coming through students not to offset flagging direct subsidies, but quite possibly because increasing revenue through tuition is, well, just what they do. At the very least, they don’t decrease tuition when appropriations times are flush.

Looking at the first table below, the trend is clear: whether state and local appropriations per full-time equivalent (FTE) student rose or fell, revenue through net FTE tuition constantly increased. (“Net tuition” is “the gross amount of tuition and fees, less state and institutional financial aid, tuition waivers or discounts, and medical student tuition and fees.” “Appropriations” exclude “special-purpose, research, and medical” outlays.) Only once—between 1999 and 2000—did tuition revenue per FTE fall, and then only by $24 dollars. The average change year-to-year was an increase of $165. The rate of increase tended to be greater in the latter years, when state and local subsidies dropped, but the overall trend is unmistakable: money through students rose no matter what appropriations did.

Note that the above table is not adjusted for inflation. As such, it better reflects what policymakers and college officials actually saw from year to year when setting appropriations and tuition levels. That said, adjusting for inflation shows much more of an up-and-down roller-coaster appropriation trend, but the same failure to cut revenue coming through tuition when direct subsidies were up, and to often increase tuition while appropriations rose, still applies.

Looking at the second table we see that funding has enriched public institutions on a per-student basis, this time after adjusting for inflation using the Higher Education Cost Adjustment (HECA), which SHEEO uses and is pegged roughly to the costs of higher education inputs, not inflation as we usually think of it. The latter is based on a “basket of goods and services” regular people buy. Using HECA, revenue per FTE rose from $10,485 in 1980 to $14,215 in 2017, a 36 percent increase. But that’s not all! FTE enrollment has ballooned since 1980—it’s a big reason inflation-adjusted appropriations per student were overall pretty flat—from about 6.9 million to 11.0 million students. The upshot is public colleges have seen inflation-adjusted, total revenue from appropriations and net tuition increase from about $71.8 billion in 1980 to $155.7 billion in 2017—more than a doubling!

The college price problem is not cheap states, or at least not cheap state and local governments. What these data suggest is that public college revenue through tuition increases no matter what happens with appropriations. Such increases may well largely be on automatic pilot because everyone expects them, and because someone ensures students can pay them.",
"With sexual harassment scandals having erupted at the likes of Disney and Uber in a public way, you'd think that companies would learn to quickly, openly, and honestly address the issue. Google hasn't yet, and now it's paying the price with a global walkout today by thousands of employees.

The Guardian reports that those joining the walkout leave on their desk a note that reads: ""I'm not at my desk because I'm walking out in solidarity with other Googlers and contractors to protest [against] sexual harassment, misconduct, lack of transparency, and a workplace culture that's not working for everyone.""

The spark for the protest was last week's news that when Andy Rubin, who created Android, left Google in 2014, it was because of a sexual harassment charge from another employee. The company swept the problem under the rug and gave Rubin a $90 million exit package: $2 million a month for four years.

Maybe Google CEO and co-founder Larry Page wanted to avoid the negative publicity. It didn't end up working that way.

But that was only a match to the kindling. The real reason is clear in the list of demands as circulated on social media:

The company that used to say ""Don't be evil"" closed its eyes. Google changed its motto to ""Do the right thing."" Whether that is truly apropos will depend heavily on its response to the walkout.

You can't ignore this issue. Trying to hush it up and make sexual harassment and inequality conveniently disappear from sight. That's good news. Such attitudes and practices are wrong. They also undercut the effectiveness of companies because they damage relationships with a major portion of workforces.

For too long there's been a bad attitude toward employees among too many executives. Many years ago, I sat at a dinner prior to a board meeting of a company where I was did product marketing. The chairman quoted someone -- Earl Nightingale, I think -- to the effect that employees should be grateful an employer gives them a job.

How condescendingly paternalistic. What about employer gratitude for anyone would want to work for them? Apparently, that wasn't on the schedule. It should have been.

Pay attention, react like a decent human being, and your company will be better off. You'll have terrific employees who appreciate being treated as they should. Ignore it, and expect your talent at all levels to go elsewhere. They don't need you; you need them. And to treat people as though they are disposable, as if they didn't matter, like the dirt under your shoes is contemptible. It's also incredibly stupid.",None
"In the twenty-first century, human capital is the most valuable resource in our economy. And though much has been done (rightly) to promote diversity at work, there’s a giant hole when it comes to understanding how temperament and sentiment play into the trajectory of success. Mental illness is a challenge, but it is not a weakness. Understanding your psyche can be the key to unleashing your strengths — whether it’s using your sensitivity to empathize with clients, your anxiety to be a more thoughtful boss, or your need for space to forge new and interesting paths. Still, less than one third of people with mental illness get the treatment they need, and this comes at a cost — to people and to companies. Failure to acknowledge an employees’ mental health can hurt productivity, professional relationships, and the bottom line: $17-$44 billion is lost to depression according to CDC. So what needs to change? Professional support needs to get better. In short, we need more flexibility, sensitivity, and open-mindedness from employers. Along with employee assistance programs, conversation and education are fundamental if our goal is to increase understanding and reduce the stigma around mental health.

Alyssa Mastromonaco is no stranger to tough conversations: she served as White House deputy chief of staff for operations under President Obama, was an executive at Vice and A&E, and is Senior Advisor and spokesperson at NARAL Pro-Choice America. So when Mastromonaco switched to a new antidepressant, she decided to tell her boss.

“I told the CEO that I was on Zoloft and was transitioning to Wellbutrin,” Mastromonaco said. “I can react strongly to meds, so I was worried switching would shift my mood and wanted her to know why. I talked about it like it was the most normal thing in the world —it is!”

Her boss was supportive. “You got it,” she said.

When Mastromonaco goes to work, she and her mental health struggles do not part ways at the door. “You want me,” she said, “you get all of me.” Mastromonaco brings tremendous talent to her workplace — but she also brings her anxiety. The same is true for high-performing employees everywhere: one in four adults experiences mental illness each year and an estimated 18% of the US adult population have an anxiety disorder. And yet we’re loath to talk about mental health at work. If we’re feeling emotional at work, our impulse is to conceal it — to hide in the bathroom when we’re upset, or book a fake meeting if we need alone time during the day. We’re hesitant to ask for what we need — flex time, or a day working from home — until we experience a major life event, like a new baby or the illness of a parent. We would more likely engage in a trust fall with our boss than admit that we have anxiety.

Mental illness is a challenge, but it is not a weakness. Understanding your psyche can be the key to unleashing your strengths — whether it’s using your sensitivity to empathize with clients, your anxiety to be a more thoughtful boss, or your need for space to forge new and interesting paths. When we acknowledge our mental health, we get to know ourselves better, and are more authentic people, employees, and leaders. Research has found that feeling authentic and open at work leads to better performance, engagement, employee retention, and overall wellbeing.

Still, less than one third of people with mental illness get the treatment they need, and this comes at a cost — to people and to companies. Failure to acknowledge an employee’s mental health can hurt productivity, professional relationships, and the bottom line: $17-$44 billion is lost to depression each year, whereas $4 is returned to the economy for every $1 spent caring for people with mental health issues.

So what needs to change? In the twenty-first century, human capital is the most valuable resource in our economy. And though much has been done (rightly) to promote diversity at work, there’s a giant hole when it comes to understanding how temperament and sentiment play into the trajectory of success. As we recognize neurological and emotional diversity in all of its forms, workplace cultures need to make room for the wide range of emotions we experience. Professional support needs to get better. We need to have the option to ask for help, and feel safe doing so (depression screenings are free under the Affordable Care Act, and some companies offer an Employee Assistance Program). In short, we need more flexibility, sensitivity, and open-mindedness from employers. The same treatment and attention they’d give to a broken bone or maternity leave. We’re not there yet, but some companies are trying to bring conversations about mental health to the forefront.

EY (formerly Ernst and Young) launched a We Care program two years ago to educate employees about mental health issues, encourage them to seek help if they need it, and be a support to colleagues who might be struggling with mental illness or addiction. They started the program out of a demonstrated need. “Our Employee Assistance Program was starting to hear more conversations about anxiety,” said Carolyn Slaski, EY Americas Vice Chair of Talent. “They told us that it was very taboo — something that people don’t normally talk about — but they were seeing more activity, so we decided to schedule a session to talk about anxiety. Just talk about it and see what would happen.”

Since the advent of the We Care program, 2000 EY employees have attended these sessions, which always have a senior-level sponsor and a mental health professional on hand. Someone in leadership kicks it off by sharing their story. This sends the message that anxiety is not toxic and attendance is not a career-dampener.

The company also has an employee assistance hotline that offers confidential support — calls related to anxiety have increased 30% over the last two years. “You have to notice first if someone is struggling,” said Slaski, “and ask them if they’re okay. Learn how to listen to their concerns, and then act. Our company has 47,000 US employees, and 250,000 globally. If I can get my team comfortable just noticing when someone has an issue, then there is so much more we can do for them. These are people reaching out for help. We want to help. We don’t want to have a stigma around it.”

Other companies, like Michigan-based furniture store, Herman Miller, offer free onsite counseling sessions to employees and their families, and courses on mental health first aid that teach them how to recognize signs of mental illness in others. The goal is to empower people to achieve their optimal state of well-being.

What organizations like EY and Herman Miller realize is that, given the right support, employees who struggle with their mental health can do great work. Most people who suffer from chronic anxiety or depression are excellent at faking wellness. We put on our makeup, get dressed, and show up on time. But we never know when an attack might be around the corner. This is why a work environment that is open and understanding is so important. Anxiety is a lingering expectation that something bad is going to happen, and if we don’t talk about it, it’s harder to recognize our triggers and learn healthy ways to cope. But when we do talk about it, we can actually teach ourselves to harness it in ways that play to our strengths.

Christina Wallace is a Harvard Business School graduate, a three-time startup founder, and an accomplished executive and creator of an innovative STEM education program. She also has panic anxiety. When asked if she ever considers her anxiety a strength, she didn’t hesitate to answer, “Absolutely.”

Christina had severe childhood trauma, and has done a lot of work to manage the after effects. “Even still,” she says, “situations where I feel like I can’t trust the other person, or the rug has been pulled out from under me, throw me into a fight-or-flight mode.” For her, this means panic attacks and crippling anxiety. To cope, Christina has taught herself to communicate openly with her managers and colleagues. For example, she has asked both her managers and the people she manages to give her written feedback on important projects before they meet in person. This way she has time to process it and prepare instead of feeling blindsided.

According to feedback from direct reports, Christina is an incredible manager. Because she has openly acknowledged her anxiety, she has learned not only how to manage it, but also how to communicate and share her needs —  a skill that helps her stay attuned to the emotional needs of others, and navigate difficult situations with grace and ease. “I’m much more aware of how to help my team show their best selves,” she said.

The good news is that times are changing, and people like Christina, along with the millions of others who struggle with mental illness, are more likely to get the help they need at work than ever before. Stew Friedman, professor at the Wharton School of Business and founding director of the Wharton Leadership Program, says “the next great sort of liberation movement in our society is about mental illness.” He sees shoots of awakening in corporate America. “Look at the huge growth in wellbeing research, practice in the private sector, and society at large. That’s one really good indicator of change.” It’s much more understood and accepted that people have emotional and mental health needs. Yet Friedman still acknowledges that there are costs to the digital revolution and how it’s affecting communication, identity, and the amount of stress we regularly experience. “There are trends that are incredibly worrisome. Rates of suicide, depression, anxiety, and drug use are all on the rise. So, our response is clearly inadequate.”

Along with employee assistance programs, conversation and education are fundamental if our goal is to increase understanding and reduce the stigma around mental health. Friedman notes the importance of conversation in his own experience: “Twenty years ago, in 1987, I started talking about what it was like to become a father and how that changed my career and my life. It was taboo for a man to talk about children at the Wharton School back then, and it got a lot of attention. I was part of a wave of change. The conversations you instigate and your awareness in choosing topics of discussion are an important piece to the process of change. Openness encourages executives to share more about their own experiences, and that normalizes the experience of others.”

In the spirit of being open, I will share that I cried in many workplace bathrooms as I cycled between anxiety attacks and clinical depression throughout my career in corporate America. It never occurred to me that I could share my struggles or create a schedule that allowed me to manage my anxiety, such as working from home or managing the flow of meetings in a day. So I just quit, over and over again. Now I know that when an employee leaves a job, the typical cost of replacement is three months of salary. Think of what the cost is — for the people and the employer — when a whole slice of the population struggles to express their most basic needs.

The burden of depression and anxiety is shared by all members of a workplace, and it’s a vicious cycle. Change starts with managers and HR professionals recognizing the ambivalence and inner conflict many insanely talented people feel, and doing something about it. Because when people get the space and the support they need, it can change their careers, and their lives.",None
"In Dan Schawbel's breakthrough new best-selling book, Back to Human: How Great Leaders Create Connection in the Age of Isolation, he argues that as technology becomes more pervasive in our lives, and robots replace more humans in the workplace, interpersonal skills (soft skills) will become even more critical for success.

Contrary to the illusion that today's workers are ""highly connected"" to one another, Schawbel's book shows that most people actually feel isolated from their colleagues, and the main cause of social isolation is technology itself.

The book features the results of an exclusive global study of more than 2,000 managers and employees that found what people at work crave the most is a sense of authentic human connection with others.

Schawbel interviewed 100 top young leaders from companies like Facebook, Google, Uber, Nike, Walmart, and the United States Air Force to ask them how they viewed technology in their roles. Most agreed that it's a ""double-edged sword,"" in that it helps their teams become more efficient, highly informed, and super-connected, but at the cost of the human touch.

In most cases, technology can actually make the workplace more dysfunctional. It keeps employees constantly working, even after they leave the office, leading to burnout and health problems.

Schawbel says, ""I recognize its power if used properly, yet when abused it can be stressful and lead to anxiety and unhappiness.

The most significant finding from the research

The research of Schawbel's global study, conducted in partnership with Virgin Pulse, uncovered a startling statistic. One-third of the more than 2,000 employees surveyed work remotely, and they're much less likely to stay at their company long-term.

In fact, only 5 percent of remote workers believe they'll be working at their company for their entire career, compared with almost a third of the workers who never work remotely. It's a profound finding, because in the past decade, the number of remote workers has increased by 115 percent.

Schawbel says, ""While remote work promotes flexibility and eliminates commuting costs, it has made employees more isolated, lonely, and less committed to their teams and organizations.""

Three leadership tips for fostering more human connections

In his book, Schawbel has provided several exercises and activities to help individuals or teams improve their human leadership skills. When asked to share some advice for how leaders can foster more human connections, Schawbel recommended three things:

1. Get to know your teammates on a personal level.

Leaders should have more frequent one-on-one, in-person discussions to truly understand how their teammates define work fulfillment and what brings them meaning and purpose. This relationship-building strategy helps leaders design a positive employee experience that appeals to each employee's sense of what truly matters to them.

Schawbel states, ""You can't possibly satisfy their needs unless you discover what they are and how your teammates best learn and excel.""

2. Minimize use of technology during meetings.

One good tip for teams coming into a meeting is to immediately place all phones in the middle of the table. This shows that team members are committing to be fully present, attentive, and ready to collaborate. ""Technology is great for organizing a meeting or event, but bad when you're physically there,"" says Schawbel.",
"Libby Wadle, a self-described “mall rat,” has always loved retail. “I was in that John Hughes era of being at the mall,” she says. “I just loved what retail was like back then—it was really about selling culture.”

From early jobs working at the mall, Wadle built a career as a retail titan, eventually serving as the president and executive vice president of J.Crew. “There was a huge community and a culture around the brand [when I joined the company]. I was part of it in college—getting the catalog, talking to the salesperson on the phone. It was a connection that you made,” she says. “You looked forward to getting the catalog and seeing what everyone was wearing and what they received in the mail. For me, there was a real connection.”

Despite headlines claiming retail is a dying industry, Wadle is still a champion of that connection. In 2017, Wadle took the reins at Madewell, where, in true Wadle fashion, she’s dedicated to making not just awesome clothes, but an awesome culture for customers.

Here, she talks about how Madewell is planning for the future of fashion and retail.

Macaela MacKenzie: You were part of the team that founded Madewell. How that evolve from J.Crew?

Libby Wadle: The turning point for us at Madewell was when we really put a stake in the ground that we wanted to be about great fitting jeans. People love to talk about the jeans they're wearing, they love to ask you about the jeans you're wearing—it just creates this connection. Madewell was built from that connection around a great fitting pair of jeans.

I like to work with brands that I have a connection with because I feel like I can really build upon and connect that passion that I have with the brand to the customer.

MacKenzie: Despite your early love of retail, you didn’t actually study fashion in school. How did you build a career for yourself in the industry you were passionate about?

Wadle: I think there is something to be said for really taking advantage of the opportunity to learn a lot [from any experience], which is what I did. I really incorporated what I loved to do into my total experience at college. So, it wasn't just about the classes I went to—it was about my entire life there. Working in retail was part of my formative years, even though it wasn't part of my schooling.

Try to expose yourself to things you love. Don't just get that internship because you think you need to do it and the person who interviews you will like it. When I meet people and candidates, I really, really look for integrity and passion, about what they're talking to me about. That's way more important than how many internships they have.

MacKenzie: The fashion industry is undergoing a series of seismic shifts. Even just in the time you’ve been president of Madewell, diversity and size inclusivity have increasingly become table stakes for brands. What shift in the fashion industry has you most excited right now?

Wadle: The extended sizing in the inclusivity movement that's going on is one of the most exciting things to happen to fashion. Forever, there has been a lack of plus-sized, larger sized, extended sized clothing. A lack of clothing for women of all shapes and sizes—even though, the fact is, the average woman falls between size 16 and 18 in America.

MacKenzie: Madewell recently launched extended sizing, expanding the range from size 23 to 37 for denim and XXS to 3X in other items. Why was that important for you as a brand leader and what’s been the reaction from customers?

Wadle: We make jeans for America. We have a goal to be the premier premium denim maker in America. We want it to be a community and we want everyone to feel like they fit in and they can join and be a part of that. It made no sense that we were not offering a size range that was inclusive.

It's been so exciting to see the reaction—and also be open to the feedback because there is a lot of feedback. I think what's been most exciting is that we've had activists in the size-inclusive community who wanted to come and talk about the business and what they think that we can be doing differently and to come and look at the line and give feedback. That's just been tremendous. I think the opportunity to engage with the community out there has been the most exciting thing.

MacKenzie: What’s the next frontier in denim?

Wadle: We're doing a lot of things around how to get the most of your old jeans in your closet. We have this amazing, amazing program with [denim recycling program] Blue Jeans Go Green. A really nice percent of our business is due to women who are able to come in and say, ""Listen, I don't want these jeans anymore, they don't feel relevant, but I don't want to throw away my jeans. What do I do with these?"" You're able to come in and recycle and get a new pair of jeans. The old jeans get refurbished into housing insulation—our community really responds to that.

I think there is a lot going on that you can do with jeans. You can buy new jeans, you can recycle your old jeans, you can do it all with Madewell.

"I was recently putting together a course for Udemy on tactics for effectively managing difficult employees, and the exercise made me think about an old boss I hadn't worked with, or actually even thought much about, for years.

She was tough as old shoe leather, and her guiding principle was that most of our company's managers were way too soft and just didn't like to manage -- and that our company would be a whole lot better off if they did.

""Up or out,"" was her favorite phrase... when discussing the future of our lower-performing (or truth be told sometimes even average-performing) employees. ""You gotta manage 'em up,"" she'd tell her management team, of which I slightly fearfully counted myself as a member, ""and improve their performance. Or else move 'em out the door."" (Why did an image of cattle always come to mind?)

""There's no room here for mediocrity,"" she'd say. ""You either make the grade or you don't. It's a jungle out there. Too many of our managers just don't manage! They're afraid to. Up or out -- get with the program.""

Despite my old boss's somewhat draconian delivery, when you look at the substance of what she was saying, it wasn't really that outrageous. In fact, it wasn't outrageous at all; there was a hard logic underlying it.

Basically, her message was that we needed to be a high-performing company, and management plays a vital role in making that happen.

In her world view there was no place for mediocrity. If an employee wasn't performing, it was a manager's job to ""manage them up"" and improve their performance.

If they couldn't improve, it was a manager's job to ""manage them out"" of the organization. Without wasting a whole lot of time at it.

Simple as that. You're either going to become a solid performer or you'll be looking for another job.

She put a lot of pressure on us young managers, for sure. Did we like her? I wouldn't actually say that. Probably about as much as Vince Lombardi's players ""enjoyed"" playing for the legendary Green Bay Packers coach. There wasn't really too much to ""like."" But did we respect her? Yeah, guess I'd have to admit we did. And did we learn a lot about management from her? Yep, have to answer affirmatively to that one too.

So much so that those three words -- ""up or out"" -- still come back to me clearly as if they were spoken yesterday, though it's been three decades since I last heard them.",
"Garry Ridge, president and CEO of WD-40 Company, is not your typical leader. He runs a company at which employee engagement hovers around 93%, at the same time that Gallup reports fully two-thirds of United States employees are disengaged from their work.

Ridge, who is a participant with me in Marshall Goldsmith’s 100 Coaches program, refers to the WD-40 team as a “tribe.” There are no “managers,” only “coaches.”

He argues that every company needs a purpose, but that most CEOs fail to provide one, which leads them to accidentally get into the business of soul-sucking their employees.

Ridge says, “The opposite of having a purpose isn’t just neutral. If you have no compelling purpose, it’s an active disadvantage in the sense that there’s a vacuum in focus and direction. That vacuum is going to be filled by absolutely the wrong things. You’ll find yourself creating unsuccessful products that don’t serve your customers. You’ll have a workplace of people treating each other in a way that’s shabby and disrespectful.”

To make his point in the most compelling manner, Ridge created a tongue-in-cheek How to be a Soul-Sucking CEO checklist. Here’s a shortened version of it:

Ridge is a highly positive and inspirational leader, so he is being sarcastic only long enough to prove a point. The status quo in most businesses is not nearly good enough. For him, there’s no chicken versus the egg dilemma (i.e. should leaders put investors, customers, or employees first?). Employee engagement is everything, he argues. Take care of employees, give them a sense of purpose, and all other stakeholders will benefit. He has many years of stellar business results to prove his case.

The power of a tribe lies not with its leader, but rather with its members. The leader’s role is simply to give members a productive reason—and system—to work together effectively.",
"When you ask leaders what’s most important to them and the success of their organizations, innovation tops their list. Innovation requires thinking differently, trying something new and charting new courses. In short, innovation requires risk taking – smart gambles that pay off for the organization.

But risk taking cannot occur if people don’t feel a sense of safety and positivity. People who feel positively are more likely to try new things, and those that feel safe believe that if they don’t quite succeed, they won’t be punished as a result.

There’s an intriguing new study that points to the relationship between positivity and risk taking through a new lens. The research found a correlation between positivity as expressed in 5.2 million tweets in large U.S. cities and sales of lottery tickets. It turned out that sunny days and home team wins – days when people were feeling more positively as reflected in their tweets – tended to correlate with a slight increase in gambling via the lottery.

While companies certainly aren’t looking to increase lottery ticket sales or reckless gambles, the relationship between positivity and behavior is inspiring. In particular, a culture of positivity pays off in creating the conditions for employees to try new things, stretch in new ways, and advance novel ideas.

Here are three simple ways to build a culture of positivity:

Recognize substantive contributions. When people provide input, ideas and new thinking, recognize their contribution. Create the kind of culture where this recognition is abundant and there is plenty to go around and where people don’t have to compete for attention from the boss.

Build on ideas. While critical thinking is important to forward movement, nubile ideas also need the opportunity to take root. When people advance new ideas, start by building on them rather than criticizing them. Later, there will be time for tough testing of ideas. But when ideas are new, give them time to develop.

Encourage yellows and reds. In project plans, don’t expect all green indicators. I worked with a brilliant leader whose team would regularly review their project plans in a monthly meeting. All the progress indicators were always green, pointing to everything being on track. The team members believed they were doing the right thing by reporting good news to the boss. But the leader wanted to know teams were stretching and knew if all she saw was green, they either weren’t trying hard enough or they weren’t telling the truth about their performance. The easy part was encouraging people to come back with reports of innovative risk taking and transparency in their performance. But,the true test was what happened when the first employee reported a yellow or a red. Rather than berating the employee for his lack of progress, the leader congratulated him on the stretch and asked what she or the group could do to help. The leader’s behavior was harbinger of the positive culture she sought to create among the group.

Building a culture of positivity isn’t the same as building an all-positive-all-the-time place. People still need a sense of reality and clarity on the business imperatives they’re seeking to accomplish. It’s important to be real within a context of acceptance and recognition.

Bottom line: Create an atmosphere of mostly sunny days and home-team wins. For innovation, appropriate risk taking is key and positivity is a critical factor for a place where new ideas sprout and smart gambles pay off.",wellness
"In 1982 Harvey Fierstein’s groundbreaking play Torch Song Trilogy was playing on Broadway at the Little Theatre. Fierstein stared as Arnold Beckhoff, a torch singer and drag queen named Virginia Ham, who is aching to find long-term love and be a husband and father in 1970s New York.  “From my understanding drag queens were happy, joking and always putting it on,” says performer and writer Drew Droege. “But here I saw a person who wanted love, acceptance and understanding.”

All those years ago, Richie Jackson, a 17-year-old senior from Bellmore Long Island sat in the audience moved beyond his core. “Arnold was the very first gay person I met besides myself,” Jackson shares. “I had never seen anything like him.  Arnold never asked anyone for acceptance. He had no shame, no self-loathing. He firmly planted his feet on the ground and made the world come around to him. He was brave and made everything possible for himself.”

At the time, Jackson knew he was gay but hadn’t told anyone yet. “It was 1982. There were no laws protecting gay people, no gay elected officials, no out movie stars, no gay characters on television. I was waiting to graduate high school, move to New York City for college and start my gay life then,” he says. As director Moisés Kaufman explains the play gave Jackson a critical message. “That his life as a gay man living in America might be possible. That he might be able to to get married and be able to have children.”

Just last month Jackson sat in the audience at the very same theater, (now called the Hayes Theater). It was opening night of the revival of the play that had changed his life. 36 years later Jackson’s dreams have come to fruition. He now has two sons and is married to Jujamcyn Theaters President Jordan Roth. Jackson is also an Emmy nominated producer whose credits include Nurse Jackie.

After the curtain call Torch Song’s director Moisés Kaufman asked Jackson to come to the stage. “He is the reason why this production is here on Broadway now,” Kaufman told the packed crowd. “His kindness, his intelligence, his courage, his determination, his insight is what brought us all here.”

Jackson, that Bellmore teen, is a producer of the play that a whole new generation can experience. Now called Harvey Fierstein’s Torch Song this riveting, heartbreaking and and hilarious production stars Michael Urie as Arnold Beckhoff, Mercedes Ruehl, Ward Horton, Roxanna Hope Radja, Michael Hsu Rosen and Jack DiFalco. “When I discovered theater, I wanted to be Arnold. I didn’t think I could, but here I am,” says Urie. “This is a very important play. It can go very deep,” adds Ruehl who plays Arnold’s judgmental mother.

Decades later, Torch Song’s message is as poignant as ever. After the show ends its Broadway run, it begins a national tour this fall with Michael Urie reprising his role as Arnold Beckoff.  “The play’s truth is what still matters,” shares director/choreographer Jerry Mitchell who saw the original Torch Song Trilogy back in the 1980s when he was a newbie to New York City and performing as a dancer with Lauren Bacall in Woman Of The Year. “There are people on that stage who live those lives. Seeing a gay man who was going to live his life on his own terms was a big deal.” (In fact, Mitchell would ultimately work with Fierstein on La Cage aux Folles, Hairspray and Kinky Boots.)

For Jackson, the play was the light he needed to navigate his way. “Torch Song gave me permission to dream bigger. It was a road map of a life that could be possible for me,” says Jackson. “Torch Song has always been a beacon for me. If you had asked me in 1982 if I thought I could ever be married or have children, I would have said “yes” because Harvey Fierstein showed me I could. And here I am in 2018 married with two children.”

Urie agrees. “In so many ways it took a Harvey Fierstein saying that to lead us to where we are now,” he shares. “Harvey set the stage for marriage equality and gay adoption. And whether or not he meant to be, he was a prophet. Without him and his leadership, who knows what would have happened? We might not have gotten here.”",
"Brent Taylor was a man who makes you realize what it means to serve.

Taylor served as mayor of North Ogden, Utah and was the kind of person interim mayor Brent Chugg told NPR’s Rachel Martin  who “made you feel good to be around.”

On November 3rd Major Brent Taylor, serving on his fourth tour of duty in Afghanistan with the National Guard, died from “green on green” attack by an Afghani infiltrator. He was 39 and left behind a wife and seven children ranging from 11 months to 13 years old.

Utah Governor Gary Herbert knew Taylor personally and said he had advised him not to do a fourth tour. “You’ve done enough. You’ve done your part.” Taylor insisted, however, says Governor Herbert. “He thought he could do some good, to help people be liberated. That’s an admirable quality that we call ought to emulate.”

That kind of service was evident in his leadership. “He was an outstanding mayor,” says Chugg. “He was very progressive. He moved this city forward in a very positive way.” Taylor was not a partisan. “He wasn’t a politician he was a statesman. He was kind to everyone. You felt good in his presence. He always had a smile on his face. He remembered your name. He was very personable.”

That style endeared Taylor to the citizens of North Ogden who re-elected him as mayor as well as to city employees to whom he “showed love and respect.” Chugg adds, “I will miss his friendship. He was a truly a great friend someone you loved and respected and could trust. Made you feel welcome where ever you were.”

Brent Taylor personifies something that Frances Hesselbein, former CEO of the Girl Scouts and colleague of Peter Drucker, believes: “to serve is to live.” Taylor exemplified that mantra whether he was at home in North Ogden or with the people of Afghanistan. His calling was the service to others. In his remembrance of Taylor, Governor Herbert posed the question that anyone in leadership should ask: “What can we do to help our fellow man?”

In an era when public service may not be as respected as it once was, Brent Taylor reminds us that working for a cause greater than yourself – be it in uniform or in your community – comes down to working to make things better for people. And Taylor did it gladly with an open heart, a kind word and ready smile.

Service to the community as an elected official is not about winning nor losing elections. It is about making things better for citizens individually and collectively. It requires participation.

“As the USA gets ready to vote in our own election next week, I hope everyone back home exercises their precious right to vote,” Taylor wrote in what turned out to be his final post on Facebook.  “And that whether the Republicans or the Democrats win, that we all remember that we have far more as Americans that unites us than divides us. ‘United we stand, divided we fall.’ God Bless America.”",
"The answer that follows could be a multitude of things depending on the individual. It's with that reason that many people embark on a quest to discover their passion and only end up more hesitant about what to do with their life.

As with nearly everything else in life, finding your passion isn't black and white. It resides in the grey and has numerous variables attached to it.

Passion is fuel to your work and life. Without any passion, unlocking your highest potential isn't going to happen. And with that in mind, I recently stumbled upon an article over at TED discussing how to uncover your best self.

Social scientists and authors of the book Dark Horse: Achieving Success Through the Pursuit of Fulfillment Todd Rose and Ogi Ogas offer four elements to fulfillment. But one of those is through the unconventional habit of finding your micro-motives.

Rose and Ogas define a micro-motive as ""a collection of super-specialized things that make your particular heart sing."" At the core of your identity, lies a subset of factors that uniquely constructs your makeup and separates you from all other humans.

Looking into factors such as your desires, activities that increase your happiness, and habits that positively propel you are key. Ignoring and misjudging these motives not only slows progress down but often times is the sole reasoning for the dissatisfaction going on in your life.

To ultimately achieve success and happiness, it's essential to know the right vehicles to jump into. Choosing the wrong vehicles may grant you money and professional accolades. But if it's not your desired destination, you'll still feel empty and hollow.

When it comes to learning more about your micro-motives, an easy but uncomfortable way to unravel them is to get judge-y. Be mindful of those gut reactions you get throughout the day or those seemingly little things that cause emotional flare-ups.

These serve as the little clues that help you construct your motives and ultimately your identity. With that said, after learning about micro-motives, I took a little over 30 minutes to work on mine and ended up with a simple exercise.

In life, there's pleasure and pain. The majority of people (including myself) react to pain much more than pleasure. I've noticed with clients that bringing into light all the associated pain of not changing is much more motivating compared to some pleasurable things that could happen.

When it comes to discovering your passion and seeking fulfillment, I wrote out an anti-vision of myself. This is all about who you don't want to be along with things that agitate and annoy you.

As you go about this, think about the person you're most afraid of becoming. What habits and behaviors do you despise the most? Who do you most despise or gets under your skin? What qualities do they have that most repel you?",
"Google employees around the world walked out today, demanding changes from the internet giant on its handling of harassment and discrimination. The Googlers listed their calls for change in The Cut today, and while the Google employees’ demands are a great start, they’re not transformative. Here’s what they asked for, and what’s really needed to transform the workplace.

Googlers demand a publicly disclosed sexual harassment transparency report. The employees are requesting that a report containing the number and type of harassment claims at Google over time, the number of victims and accused who left Google and their exit packages.

What would be even better is a sexual harassment climate survey. The problem with reporting on sexual harassment claims is that most sexual harassment victims do not report the harassment. Therefore, there could be rampant harassment at Google, and if employees were reluctant to report, it would not show up on the report the Googlers are requesting. Instead, a climate survey would allow Google to survey all of its employees to determine if they have been harassed themselves or witnessed others being harassed. The survey could also tap into other climate issues like whether employees feel respected, and whether they believe they have faced discrimination in pay or promotions. The survey could also be repeated annually to determine whether the atmosphere at Google is changing.

Googlers demand transparent data on the gender, race and ethnicity pay gap. The Google employees basically want statistics on promotion rates, project and job ladder change opportunities, and compensation aggregated by gender, race and ethnicity. They want these statistics to take into account the employee’s level and years of experience.

What would be even better is full pay transparency. The transparent data summary is a great start, but full pay transparency is really the only way to eliminate pay gaps. Finding out exactly what all your coworkers earn makes the pay gap problem self-correcting. There can be no statistical manipulation or hiding of problems. All the data would be there for everyone to see.  Those who were not being paid fairly would be aware of the issue immediately.

Although Whole Foods adopted pay transparency several years ago, and some smaller tech companies have also jumped on board, it’s not an easy transition. In the mean time, if Google decides to go the easier route of releasing statistical analysis of pay, I would urge them to outsource the analysis to increase the credibility of their findings.

Googlers demand an improved process for reporting sexual misconduct. They feel that the current process forces HR to put management’s interests ahead of the interests of employees who are reporting harassment and discrimination.

What would be better is outsourcing the reporting of sexual misconduct. Technology is Google’s area of expertise, not handling sexual harassment claims. Outsourcing the reporting of harassment and discrimination allows Google to focus on what it does best, and allows an outside organization to be in charge of processing any claims. The outside organization can be in charge of investigating the claims and may be less likely to defer to the wishes of Google’s management.  Outsourcing also may make it easier for employees to report sexual misconduct, because employees may feel more comfortable speaking to someone outside of Google about their experiences with Google employees.

Googlers make yet more demands. The Googlers also demand an end to forced arbitration in cases of harassment and discrimination.  They also requested that the chief diversity officer report directly to the CEO and that he or she be able to make recommendations directly to the board of directors. In addition, they would like an Employee representative appointed to the board.

What the Googlers are missing. Several of the allegations of Google employees that were released by the New York Times last week regarding consent and consensual relationships.  Google needs to teach its employees how to deal with attraction at work and how to have relationships in a professional environment.

Google has the opportunity to really transform the norms for business in this country.  They could do the minimum required to keep their employees satisfied and coming to work each day, or they could take this opportunity to exceed the demands of their employees and to become a leader in creating a hospitable workplace and offering career potential to men and women of all races and ethnicities.",
"When you think of top leadership qualities, some that might come to mind include strong decision making, strategic thinking, and communication skills. But the trait employers are increasingly taking into consideration when hiring and promoting new leaders may surprise you--humility.

To hire more humble leaders, some businesses now ask questions specific to measuring humility during the hiring process--either through personality tests, prescreen surveys or interview questions. These questions might include, ""Do you appreciate teammates' feedback at work?"" or ""As a leader, do you think you're entitled to more recognition than the rest of your team?""

Why are businesses looking for humble leaders now more than ever? Recent studies have found that leading with humility can result in stronger teamwork, increased employee engagement, decreased turnover and continuous learning and improvement.

Leaders who are invested in their own self-interest tend to take on more work than they can handle--rather than delegating tasks--and often think their opinions are more important than their teammates' feedback.

On the other hand, humble leaders appreciate their employees' strengths and trust them to do effective work to help move the company forward. When it comes to delegating work, being humble and trusting your employees is a win-win, as it will make your business more productive and encourage your team to work together toward common goals.

Humble leaders also constantly seek feedback to improve processes, company culture and other areas of the business. By staying humble and proactively collecting employee feedback, this can lead to a more collaborative environment and improved teamwork. Ultimately, this creates much stronger teamwork than being a leader who mostly prefers to have everything done your way.

Beyond delegating work and openly accepting feedback, humble leaders aren't threatened by their team's talent and are quick to offer their teams recognition where recognition is due, instead of taking credit for the team's work. According to Aon's 2018 Trends in Global Employee Engagement report, public recognition is one of the top factors that improves employee engagement.

My team at Hireology makes an effort to regularly recognize employees for their great work. We hold a weekly all-company huddle, and, during this time, employees are recognized for exemplifying our core values over the past week. We also do an annual awards ceremony recognizing employees who have displayed our core values throughout the year. And individual team throughout the company often have their own ways of recognizing team members.

If employees don't receive any feedback or recognition for their work--or, worse, if a leader takes credit for their work--this can make employees frustrated enough to leave the company. But if you're a humble leader who respects and recognizes employees, this can help your team retain employees. And employee retention can have a significant impact on your bottom line--for a 50-employee company, a 15 percent improvement in employee retention can translate to nearly $400,000 in additional profit per year.

Humble leaders have a strong understanding of their strengths and weaknesses, and as a result are always looking for ways to improve their roles, and improve the company for the better. Conversely, leaders who lack humility are likely hesitant to recognize their own weaknesses, which poses a risk for these leaders growing stagnant in their roles, and can have a negative impact on the company's growth.

One of my team's core values is ""eager to improve,"" so from entry-level employees all the way up to the leadership team, we're always looking to hire employees who aren't afraid to admit their weaknesses and identify ways to overcome them. These employees are often among the most motivated to continuously improve, grow in their careers and help the company reach its collective goals.",coaching
"Facebook says it has pulled around 115 accounts on its platforms ahead of the 2018 midterm election due to potentially ""coordinated inauthentic behavior,"" but offered few further details.

On Monday evening, Facebook announced that it had identified and blocked close to 30 Facebook accounts and 85 Instagram accounts which ""may be engaged in coordinated inauthentic behavior"" ahead of the 2018 US midterm elections. In a blog post, Facebook Head of Cybersecurity Policy Nathaniel Gleicher said that the company is investigating the accounts further, and will update with any new information.

According to Facebook, the accounts in question mostly appeared to use French or Russian languages on Facebook, while the Instagram accounts seemed to mostly be in English. The company noted that some accounts it had blocked ""were focused on celebrities"" and others on ""political debate,"" and that it has yet to determine the source of the pages, but believes they ""may be linked to foreign entities.""

Regarding the timing and relatively low number of details of Facebook's announcement, Gleicher wrote in his blog post, ""Typically, we would be further along with our analysis before announcing anything publicly. But given that we are only one day away from important elections in the US, we wanted to let people know about the action we’ve taken and the facts as we know them today.""

The company also said that law enforcement had notified Facebook about the accounts on Sunday evening. As Ars Technica pointed out, Reuters reported early on that this tip came from the FBI, apparently based on an earlier version of Facebook's blog post, but Facebook declined to confirm this detail to Ars Technica or offer further ones.

Before Facebook's announcement on Monday, meanwhile, the FBI and other federal agencies issued a joint statement noting that ""foreign actors — and Russia in particular — continue to try to influence public sentiment and voter perceptions through actions intended to sow discord.""

In recent months, Facebook has seemingly tried to demonstrate on numerous occasions that it is taking a more active role in keeping misinformation schemes and interference-prone foreign actors off its platforms.

In October, Facebook said it had pulled dozens of accounts linked to Iran from both Facebook and Instagram, and announced this summer that it had taken down an event page for a counter-protest that it believed to be organized by foreign actors. While an inauthentic account may have been temporarily linked to that event page, however, the event's real-life (American) organizers argued that the company took down their page without due cause.

The company's latest announcement came less than 24 hours before polls were set to open across the US for the November 6 midterm election.

In the days leading up to the election, media and technology researcher Jonathan Albright also detailed the results of his latest analysis of Facebook activities and supervision in a Medium post.

See also: Algorithms And 'Uberland' Are Driving Us Into Digital Serfdom

Based on his analysis of around 250,000 posts and 5000 political ads, Albright found (among other things) ""influential Pages with foreign 'manager' accounts that have been running extensive political ad campaigns on Facebook, targeting users in the United States over the past six months.""

Albright also noted that there are ""known issues with the company’s political ad verification process,"" and presented examples which he says exhibit a pattern of ""structural 'loopholes'"" in Facebook's ad disclosure system. However, the bigger issue, Albright argued, is that Facebook ""does not appear to have a rigid protocol in place to regularly monitor Pages running political campaigns after the initial verification takes place.""

"Election day is almost upon us and, as the breathless around-the-clock news coverage insists, the results of this midterm election will be as consequential as any in modern memory. The outcomes hinge largely on voter turnout, which means that young voters will be hugely influential if they get to the polls in high numbers. According to the Pew Research Center, 59% of adults who are eligible to vote are Gen Xers, Millennials or post-Millennials, yet they cast 21 million fewer votes than older generations in the last midterm elections in 2014. The reasons for this gap are more complex than they seem, including barriers to voting like onerous ID laws and the closing of hundreds of polling locations. Despite these obstacles, citizens can and must cast their ballot on Tuesday.

But too often voting is mistaken as the only exercise of our civic duty--as not merely a positive outgrowth of a functional democracy, but democracy itself. We are thinking too small. Democratic actions are the behaviors we exhibit in our immediate lives every day, the real work of running communities and organizations, of disagreeing with our neighbors and finding compromises with which we can all live. Only when we are doing that work throughout the year will we have a thriving citizenry.

The good news is that we can grow a more resilient democracy by starting with young people, in one of the institutions that helps shape their identities: college. For many of us, college is the first opportunity to flex our civic muscles, the place where we start to engage the political world as adults. To be clear, it’s not the only place young people can have this experience and it only works if colleges allow for the exploration of truly varied ideas across the political spectrum. But it can work for many.

At their best, colleges can be incubators for healthy civic engagement and disagreement. Campuses are physical, cultural and intellectual communities. They are governed by their own sets of rules but still beholden to state and and national laws. On campus, students are neighbors, consumers and fellow citizens in a (semi) democratic microcosm. Whether it’s student government or student theater, colleges can provide relatively low-risk environments to test political ideas and governing processes. They are places for young people to exercise agency and organize for the greater good. Most importantly, colleges offer opportunities for Americans to develop healthy habits of civic engagement that can last a lifetime.

As scholar John Dewey wrote in 1938, “Education in order to accomplish its ends both for the individual learner and for society must be based upon experience.” Creating a college environment that is rich with practical democratic experiences is crucial to achieving the personal and social ends of a more robust democracy.

This approach can be woven into the fabric of the college experience, from debate in the classroom to the physical design of dormitories. David B. Hoffman of UMBC’s Breaking Ground civic engagement initiative has identified several ways in which colleges can align campus practices with civic ideals, including:

A few years ago at Bennington College, a group of students got first-hand civic experience when they organized a protest calling for the college to divest from fossil fuels. We responded by inviting those students into the process already under way for selecting a new investment firm. We asked them to draft a request for proposals for socially responsible investing. This work was entirely new to these undergraduates, but they rose to the occasion. They explored options for responsible investing, researched the obligations of the board of trustees and learned how to draft an RFP. They did the necessary legwork to arrive at a solution that would satisfy their interests and meet the responsibilities of the college. In the end, their firm of choice was selected.

That experience was valuable in its own right and had nothing to do with voting, but it happens to be the sort of exposure that experts say can encourage participation on Election Day. According to the Tufts Institute for Democracy & Higher Education Election Imperatives report,

These year-round, 365-day opportunities for civic engagement abound when you are in the habit of looking for them. At Bennington, students are currently working with faculty, officials and community members to fight the contamination of local drinking water; they have hosted discussions with local stakeholders on issues such as farmland runoff; and they lead an outreach effort to help connect migrant workers in Vermont with legal, educational and medical resources.

You don’t have to be a political science student or a budding community organizer to participate. In fact, we encourage students of the arts to recognize the places where civic action intersects with music, literature and theater. (A visual arts project created by Bennington students and faculty was just unveiled at the U.S. Embassy in Oslo, Norway, which explores the interconnected ecology and politics of the U.S. and the Arctic Council nations.) On campus, as in life, opportunities to build a more compassionate, engaged society are all around us and in every discipline.

Foster a culture of engagement for individual success and a stronger democracy

The societal benefits of this approach are apparent: more engagement at the national and local level, and a more civil way of coexisting with our differences. But there are many benefits to the individual as well. According to the American Association of State Colleges and Universities American Democracy Project, “Exposing students to civic learning opportunities increases the likelihood that they will complete college and boosts their chances of success after graduation.” Recognizing one’s capacity to make change in college appears to empower students in other areas of their lives.

This Tuesday, I hope college students turn out in record numbers to vote for whichever candidates inspire them. I hope they prove the doubters wrong and demonstrate that Generation Z is as politically engaged as every preceding generation. But the real work also happens on Wednesday, and every day thereafter, to foster an environment of action, civility and aspirations for a more robust democracy.",
"There is always something special and important about elections. They affirm a basic right that we have as citizens of the United States. On November 6th, the United States midterm elections will take place. While there is no Presidential election, any political junkie or casual observer knows the importance of this election. Early November can be a volatile time of year from a weather perspective so it is always useful to keep an eye on it. Here is a region-by-region snapshot four days in advance of potential weather conditions on Election Day.

As a meteorologist, I could anchor this analysis solely on my own interpretations. For the sake of objectivity, I heavily reference the most current (as of November 2nd) thinking of the National Weather Service (NWS) Weather Prediction Center (WPC) and various forecast offices around the nation with a bit of my interpretation sprinkled in. I focus on the morning of Election Day but obviously weather will evolve throughout the day. The graphic below is the surface weather map on the morning of Election Day. There are a couple of significant weather features that catch my eye. An area of low pressure sits just to the southwest of the Great Lakes regions with connected cold, warm, and occluded fronts. In synoptic meteorology, this would be characterized as a mature mid-latitude cyclone. According to a NOAA website, a mid-latitude cyclone is

These storms represent the power of the atmosphere when different air masses are present and interacting. Based on the projected map, this storm system will certainly make its presence felt on Election Day.

Midwest and Great Lakes Region: The National Weather Service Indianapolis Forecast Discussion issued at 3:24 am EDT on November 2nd. It provides a good synopsis of what can be expected in this region:

I took a look at the American GFS weather model (below). I couldn't help but notice the closeness of the lines of constant pressure. In meteorology, we call those lines isobars. To the untrained eye, they may look like a bunch of circles, but they actually contain information. The closeness of the isobars  is an indication of a stronger pressure gradient (difference in pressure over a given distance). A stronger pressure gradient means stronger winds. Wherever you see closer isobars, windy conditions can be expected with the large area of rainfall in the Midwest and Great Lakes region.

Southern Region: For the Southern Region, I draw from the National Weather Service (Atlanta area) Forecast Discussion issued at 3:57 am EDT on November 2nd:

This analysis suggests that parts of the Southeast, including my state of Georgia, could be dealing with showers and storms. Some date even hints at potentially tornadic or severe weather in parts of Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia, but we will need to watch the evolving information. Most of the state of Florida looks relatively sunny, but the panhandle could experience some rain showers because of the aforementioned frontal system.

Mid-Atlantic and Northeast Region: The National Weather Service-Sterling Forecast Discussion issued at 3:07 am on November 2nd suggests that the warm front on the map could bring rain to the Mid-Atlantic region on Monday night and Tuesday morning:

Forecast offices from New York to Boston suggest a chance of rainfall Monday night and possibly into Tuesday as well.

Great Plains and Texas:  Forecast Discussions that I perused for the National Weather Service-Norman (Oklahoma) and National Weather Service (Austin-San Antonio) indicate fairly clear conditions by Election Day.

Western Region, Alaska, and Hawaii: The vast majority of the Western region looks nice. I find primarily sunny conditions for most of California, the desert Southwest, and into Denver, Colorado. However, there is a chance of snow in some of the upper mountainous states like Montana and a chance of rain in the Pacific Northwest. Showers are also likely in the southern part of Alaska but better conditions are expected further north. The National Weather Service-Honolulu is calling for a slight chance of showers before mostly sunny conditions.

As I have written in Forbes before, weather conditions can impact turnout. CNN Politics political analyst Harry Enten, formerly of Five Thirty Eight, recently discussed the upcoming elections and weather with me on the Weather Geeks Podcast. If you have the option to vote early, you might want to exercise that option. However, this election is so important so please vote in spite of the weather.",
"Sadness, as a basic human emotion, is unavoidable in life. People you love will hurt you, and get sick and die. You'll fail at things. Bad events will happen, and you can't stop them. Fortunately, sadness is a temporary state (unlike depression, a long-term mental illness), and according to experts, it's an emotion that can actually be good for you.

Being sad can make you more creative.

It depends on how you handle your sadness, however. Researchers studied 244 college students and tracked whether they engaged in brooding (repeating negative thinking over and over) or self-reflective pondering (examining one's thoughts and figuring out what to do about them). They found that pondering was associated with higher levels of creativity, whereas brooding tended to only make participants feel worse.

When you're happy, you really don't want anything to change. But being in a negative emotional state is uncomfortable, a prompt that moves people toward action. Joseph P. Forgas, PhD, professor of psychology at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia, conducted research in which participants where shown either happy or sad movies and then tasked with answering multiple difficult questions. The happy participants did far worse than the sad ones, spending less time, answering fewer questions, and getting less of them correct.

Your lows help you appreciate the highs.

Helen Russell, author of The Atlas of Happiness, explains that the Brazilians use the word ""saudade"" to describe the absence of and longing for happiness which once was. And researchers have discovered that making room for transient sadness helps people notice details, persevere, be more generous, and count their blessings. ""Saudade teaches us that a degree of melancholy in life is inevitable -- desirable, even -- and something to be savored rather than ignored,"" she writes. ""No one can be carnival-happy all the time, and the lows help us appreciate the highs.""

Your happiness will probably return.

According to Art Markman, PhD, professor of psychology and marketing at the University of Texas at Austin, humans have a set point for happiness. So, at some point, weeks or months after your difficulty has passed, you'll probably feel as happy as you were before the negative life event happened. ""That doesn't mean that events can't have a long-term influence on how happy you are,"" he writes, ""just that the best predictor of how happy you will be several months after a big positive or negative event is how happy you were before it.""",
"Every year at this time, one of my colleagues throws a fit. “I can’t believe we’re still doing this!” she exclaims. “I hate it!” She’s usually calm and good-natured; what could get her so riled up? The end of Daylight Saving Time. She describes herself as “violently opposed” to Standard Time, lamenting that it “defies logic and happiness.” She argues that permanent Daylight Saving would result in a few more dark mornings for people on the western edges of the time zones, but would more than make up for it in the extended evening daylight that everyone would enjoy.

In fact, studies are torn on the efficacy of changing the clock. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 extended Daylight Saving Time by 4-5 weeks, an attempt to help Americans save energy by using less lighting. Studies found that lighting using did decrease a bit, but heating and cooling usage increased. People went out more, but there was a corresponding increase in gas usage. At certain times of the year, it would delay sunrise in a few places until 8:30am. Meanwhile, the US Chamber of Commerce praised the move for increasing the amount of shopping that occurred after work hours. Even the candy industry loved it, because it provided Halloween trick-or-treaters more daylight. More daylight, more trick-or-treaters, more candy!

Whether you like it or not, fall back you will this weekend. Here are suggestions on how to maximize the value of your bonus hour:

Many people complain about their work-life balance. It seems there are never enough hours in the day to fulfill your personal and professional obligations. They also complain about a lack of opportunity to network, learn, and work on their business. So with this extra hour, consider investing time in your relationships. Give an hour of uninterrupted time to your significant other, parent, or child. Invite a business connection to coffee to discuss how you can make money together. Host a happy hour at work to improve morale and deepen your company’s community. Life is all about people, so make your extra hour all about them, too.

As fall fades to winter - and as the days get shorter! - it becomes more difficult to make time for personal health. There are lots of good reasons this happens: it’s the busiest season at work; it’s the time of year when kids have millions of activities; fewer daylight hours mean daylight-sensitive items get re-prioritized, etc. But here’s the thing - winter might be the most important time of the year to exercise. It releases endorphins to combat the winter blues, and it helps strengthen your immune system against those nasty winter bugs. Exercise also helps maintain healthy habits that won’t require drastic efforts to undo in the spring. It keeps your brain sharp and helps you sleep better, too.

My wife is a daily yoga devotee. She has found it makes her fit and strong, and also helps keep her mind sharp and agile. Even if yoga isn’t your thing, the focus and clear headspace encouraged during yoga is an excellent skill to possess. So consider using your hour to find and practice a meditation method that works for you, and make a plan to do it every day for a week. You may find the benefits to be profound.

Sleep is so essential that you’re supposed to devote a full third of every day to it. But be honest - how many of you actually get a solid 8 hours regularly? Even occasionally? Probably not many. So since you have an extra hour this weekend, stay in bed late or take a cat nap. It’ll feel like a treat, and your body and mind will thank you.

Do your team a favor this winter. Take the extra hour and use it to help develop your employees and grow your company. Plan a learning event, organize a guest speaker lunch, or invite a wellness expert to visit your company. There are lots of inexpensive ways you can build a strong culture and help your colleagues flourish.",
"Bitcoin could be heading down to $2,000 or up to $10,000, depending on the forecasting model applied to estimate the digital currency’s “intrinsic” or “fair” value.

Bitcoin has been falling fast, very fast, breaking one price “floor” after another.

First, it broke the $6000-mark -- a “floor” the digital currency held for almost three months. Soon after, it crossed the $5700-mark, another “floor” according to some experts.

That’s a round number that could also be considered a “floor” for the digital currency by those who follow market charts closely.

All in all, Bitcoin is down close to 30% in just seven days, and close to 80% over a twelve month period.

What’s driving the sell-off? Chebotaev, CEO of Betmatch, blames the threat of the “hash war.” “I think the hash war will continue to cause a bit of havoc with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but now is the time to buy Bitcoin, and we need to give Bitcoin a chance to bounce, because it will rise again.”

Patrick Palacios, CEO and founder of LoyalCoin, blames several factors. “The Bitcoin sell off is a combination of everything, The BCH Hard Fork, trader groups pumping and dumping, lack of regulation, THE OKEx allegations of market manipulation, all leading to very emotional trading,” he says. “Couple that with Nouriel Roubini’s Mr. Doom talk and you have a very unstable situation, which will take a few weeks to stabilize.”

How “few” is a few weeks is hard to say. But based on the digital currency’s history, its price can be all over the map for weeks or even months before it reaches a new stable price.

That’s usually the “intrinsic” or “fair” value. What that would be depends on the econometric model applied to estimate the digital currency’s “intrinsic” value.

On the one side is Wheatley’s Model, which estimates the intrinsic value of Bitcoin by looking at the demand side of the price equation. It places Bitcoin’s value well below its current price, at $1,242.64.

On the other side is Hayes Model, which estimates Bitcoin’s intrinsic value by looking at the supply side of the price equation. It places Bitcoin’s value at $10,179.25.

Then there’s the Market Model, which looks at both the demand and supply side of the price equation. It places Bitcoin’s value very close to Hayes Model estimate, at $10,845.77.

“These three intrinsic valuations provide interesting insights,” says Greg Giordano, who ran the simulations of the three models after the recent Bitcoin declines. “First off, this is one of the first times the Market Model has ever risen above Hayes' model. The reason for this is that mining revenue has fallen; however, transactions/block and unique addresses have actually increased, while mining difficulty has stayed steady. It is very interesting to see more users actually creating accounts for Bitcoin in such a bearish environment. Along with this, the amount of resources being put toward mining has not dropped off at all.”

While, it’s unclear which of the three models will eventually turn out to be right, one thing is clear: volatility in cryptocurrency markets will continue.

[Ed. note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment. Disclosure: I don't own any bitcoin.]",
"Netflix’s biggest problem isn’t competition from Disney. It’s the fact that they are running out of new subscribers at home and abroad.

Competition from Disney will change the rules of the game for Netflix. Disney is a constant powerhouse, transforming its business model. “Disney is developing a direct-to-consumer capability via ESPN+ which will permit subscribers to consume sports content on demand via an app,” says equity analyst John Zolidis.  “Separately, DIS is developing a streaming service for the substantial pantheon of Disney TV and movie properties. We think both of these efforts have the potential to be extremely successful and in particular, we believe a Disney streaming offer could easily become a must-have subscription, perhaps even more successful than Netflix (which currently has access to much Disney content).”

To keep up with Disney, the streaming giant will have to compete over new rather than old movies.

And that’s an expensive and risky proposition, which requires new valuation metrics for one of Wall Street’s hot stocks.

Netflix’s PE, for instance, should trade at a fraction of its current price, if Disney’s valuation metric was applied.

But Netflix’s biggest threat doesn’t come from new competition. It comes from the drying up of the pool of new subscribers. Economists call it market saturation.

That’s when emerging companies reach maturity and their growth slows. Slow growth, in turn, creates a zero-sum business environment whereby there’s a fight for market share, which leads to price wars.

And that’s what kills momentum for the company’s stock on Wall Street.

Market saturation killed AOL’s momentum in the past, and it will kill Netflix’s this time around.

In the third quarter of 2018, Netflix had over 137 million streaming subscribers worldwide, according to data from Statista.com. Of these subscribers, 58.46 million were from the United States.

That’s close to 50% of all American households.

Will the remaining 50% subscribe to Netflix? Most likely not. Some American households have already moving streaming services from Netflix’s competitors, while others don’t stream movies at all.

Meanwhile, there’s a segment of Netflix’s market that has reached saturation: the teenage market. At least that’s the impression I got when I asked students in three different high schools last week to indicate who had a Netflix subscription.

To be precise, almost everyone in the class had a subscription! And those who didn’t they didn’t plan to subscribe.

Is this anecdotal evidence indicative of what’s happening around the country? Hard to say. But young people are an important consumer group. They are the “innovators,” in the Rogers Curve of product adoption.They’re the ones who carry the “buzz” for new product. And as this group goes, so goes the buzz for the product.

Still, there’s the rest of the world, Netflix’s bulls will say. But growth in these markets is constrained by a number of factors. Like government regulations, poor Internet connection, low cost of cable services, and extremely low income to mention but a few.

The bottom line: The time when Netflix could grow its subscription base for quarter after quarter to meet Wall Street’s ever high expectations are over.

And so is the big run up of its stock.",
"The beat goes on with administrative leaders and coaches in college football embroiled in case studies of poor leadership. First, the Notre Dame scandal, then Ohio State and Urban Meyer, now The University of Maryland and head coach DJ Durkin.

Maryland fired its head football coach on Wednesday after an investigation of a ""toxic culture"" driven by the coaching staff. Many blame a culture of fear, intimidation, and shaming for pushing 19-year-old player Jordan McNair to a tragic death, caused by complications of heatstroke following an intense May 29th practice.

If the story stopped there, perhaps you could commend the brain trust, The University System of Maryland (USM) Board of Regents and the University President, Wallace Loh, for acting decisively to deal with multiple reports of a ""toxic culture"".

The backlash was broad-based. Marty McNair, father of Jordan, said of the board's initial recommendation to reinstate Durkin, ""I feel like I've been punched in the stomach, and somebody spit in my face."" Several football players walked out of practice upon Durkin's return. Students organized a November 1 protest on campus, calling for Durkin's firing. Maryland Governor, Larry Hogan, even weighed in saying he was ""deeply concerned at how the USM regents could have possibly arrived at the decision (to reinstate Durkin).""

Hogan called for a public meeting with the USM to get them to reconsider their decision, saying they ""had let down the University of Maryland community and the citizens of Maryland"", and that, ""now is the time to fix it.""

The debacle serves as a primer for leaders on what not to do when finding a toxic employee in the ranks. Here's what Maryland leadership did wrong in hopes that you can get it right in your own circumstances.

Jordan McNair tragically passed away on June 13. The USM Board of Regents didn't take over the investigation of the tragedy and the reports of a toxic football culture until August 17. For something of this magnitude, the Board should have assumed control much sooner.

You should move even faster when you hear of a toxic employee. The multiplicative effect that one negative employee can have on a culture can't be underestimated.

Incredibly, the Board of Regents interpreted a damning (albeit conflicting) report in favor of coach Durkin. As ESPN reported, the investigation concluded that there wasn't a toxic culture nor did one directly contribute to McNair's death, and that ""a dysfunctional athletic department didn't serve Durkin well in his development as a first-time head coach."" However, there were disturbing instances uncovered including the use of bullying and humiliation tactics by strength coach Rick Court and the fact was that players didn't feel comfortable going to Durkin with their concerns.

The Board sided on making excuses for Durkin, despite having plenty of evidence to the contrary. They were hoodwinked by a report and/or likely hearing what they wanted to hear versus holding high-standards and taking the action that was required.

When faced with a toxic employee, keep a clear, unbiased head and start with what you know to be the right thing to do despite spinning and positioning you're presented with.

The way to address toxic behavior in a culture is not to engage in toxic, bullying behavior yourself. Such sensitive matters require leadership to be arm in arm in their intervention.

Before the reinstatement of Durkin, The Chair of the Board of Regents, James Brady, said, ""We believe that Coach Durkin has been unfairly blamed for the dysfunction in the athletic department. While he bears some responsibility, it is not fair to place all of it at his feet.""

While the Board hid behind a cry for ""fairness"", you can't help but wonder if their tolerance for Durkin had to do with the fact that he was such a prized coaching recruit, snatched from the University of Michigan. At a minimum, there was a misplaced priority on protecting a coach versus holding a head coach accountable for everything that happens on his staff.

5. Let political pressure be the driver versus doing what's right",
"It’s hard to overstate how much business success relies on better, faster decision making. Bain & Company research found that decision making effectiveness drives 95% of business performance. The UK Institute for Employment found that decision practices impact 50% of employee engagement. Your company’s decision practices have a huge impact on how your business and your employees perform.

At the same time, leaders face rapidly increasing pressure to innovate. Speed has always mattered in business, but the pressure from digital transformation is different. This graph of key economic measures shows how much different business is today. Slow and steady for hundreds of years, the rate of change suddenly exploded:

Decisions are made for two reasons: to proactively make change happen, or to react to change when it occurs. So as change increases, decision making must keep pace. The fastest become market leaders. The slowest are pounded by change, falling farther and farther behind.

This change-driven pressure demands a new approach to business decision making. Our new research identifies 7 key decision practices that distinguish top performing innovative companies. Knowing about these practices sets the stage for improvement. But how do companies go about putting these practices in place?

In our work with companies like Cisco Systems, Sanofi Pasteur and Moss Adams, we’ve found that improving a process as fundamental as a company’s decision making depends on more than process and technology. Change also requires trust. Successful businesses lean into the need for trust by focusing on delegation, transparency and accountability.

These three points on the triangle reinforce each other to build the trust required to make organizational change happen. Executives are more comfortable delegating decisions when transparency gives clear visibility and accountability keeps results in focus. Transparency helps delegated decision makers get productive input from stakeholders while naturally creating a culture of accountability. And the people impacted by decisions are more capable and motivated to execute when the process is transparent and everyone is held accountable for the results of their decisions.

When the points of the triangle are strong and trust is high, companies have faster, better decision practices. They engage their employees, they innovate and adapt, they execute quickly and efficiently. When the triangle is weak, decision friction is everywhere. People are confused and out of sync, ideas are ignored, execution is too rigid and too slow.

When trust is in place the difference is clear, as you can see in these quotes from people working in high performing innovative companies:

But in companies without trust, the story is one of surprise and confusion, wasted time and lost opportunity:

Don’t be the company wasting time in pointless meetings. Be the company that makes decisions fast that spread like wildfire.

The Last Word -- Leaning Into Trust

As research director for worldwide digital transformation strategies, IDC’s Shawn Fitzgerald knows a lot about the demands and opportunities of this new world. “To compete, it is imperative for organizations to make smarter, more timely decisions at scale,” he says. “Insight into what decisions represent opens up more transparency across the enterprise, leading to more effective execution and speeding up digital transformation efforts.”

To get started, read more about the decision practices used by top companies and how inclusive decision making drives more effective decisions. Consider a decision-making benchmarking survey to measure where your company stands. And when you’re ready to make a change, lean into the trust imperative.",
"On her 32nd birthday, British actress, model and presenter Jameela Jamil was scrolling through her Instagram when she came across a picture featuring the Kardashian family. In this image, all the Kardashian women had a number written across their bodies. “I clicked on that picture expecting to see their net worth and all I saw was their weight. I remember trying to immediately imagine a photograph of a group of successful men with their weight written across their bodies. I couldn’t,” says Jamil.

In 2018, it seems that while women might be successful, talented and accomplished, Jamil says their is still a tendency to value women based on their body size. In this interview Jamil shares how she is working to disrupt these messages and what actions women can take to reaffirm their worth.

Share how much you really weigh

As a teenager Jamil struggled with a prolonged eating disorder that severely impacted her health. “This really messed up my life. I realized that I am currently working in an industry that is probably hurting other 15-year-old girls who are vulnerable. I must do something and use my platform,” she says.

After seeing the image of the Kardashians, Jamil decided to launch the ""I Weigh"" movement. The aim of the initiative is to recognize men or women for their achievements, lived experiences and everything they have overcome rather than simply their weight. “We need to change the way we look at ourselves and encourage women just to write down who they are, what they've done, what they've been through. I think you can very easily forget who you are and what you're worth and what you stand for,” says Jamil. By writing down all your achievements, Jamil says you will begin to accept that you weigh the sum of your parts.

Jamil wants to change the way society views women and she argues that business have an important role to play in this. As such, Jamil is encouraging consumers to use their purchasing power and no longer support brands that utilize body shaming content. “By choosing what to consume, you can manipulate what is sold. We fund tabloid magazines. Every time you buy a tabloid magazine, you are contributing to hatred of women. So vote with your wallet. If we stop paying any attention to the people that sell appetite suppressant lollipops then the company will go bankrupt and will stop selling them,” she says.

This doesn’t stop with products, Jamil says we can also stop supporting negative influencers on social media. “We can all unfollow the toxic people, which then gives them less power and makes them less likely to be used for branding and advertising. Then we will no longer have to see their toxic messages. We fund all these influencers,” says Jamil.

Jamil’s long-term aim is to reset the way society views women, which she believes starts with eliminating photo-shopping. “We want to change the rules on airbrushing. We would love to abolish it. I think that's one of the most dangerous things to happen to women, as they must compete with computerized imagery. We're comparing ourselves to celebrities who they themselves don't even look like that,” she says.

Even if businesses do not ban airbrushing all together, Jamil says one action they all could take is to simply declare on the advertisement or product that the image was airbrushed. “I think this will make airbrushing seem less appealing to the advertiser because they have to write down that they have manipulated the image, which is embarrassing,” she says.

Jamil urges women to push back on the negative messaging that airbrushing creates by regularly writing down their attributes, activities and achievements. “Remember that every minute you spend hating yourself for the way that you look is a minute you aren't spending growing your business, life, family and happiness. Your looks will fade but your life will carry on. Build a life. Don't focus too much on your looks,” she says.",
"Black Friday has traditionally been coined the kickoff to the holiday season. However, we have seen Cyber Monday gain increased popularity over the past 10 years. In fact, last year's Cyber Monday resulted in historic online sales reaching $6.59 billion. It's time to understand how Cyber Monday can benefit your business this upcoming holiday season.

With the rise in online shopping, marketers are transitioning from Black Friday doorbusters to promo-code-driven flash sales on Cyber Monday. Going digital for the biggest discount weekend of the year is a risk that you should take with strategy in hand.

First, give your customers something of value, even if you don't host an e-commerce website. With big brands promoting their sales, give ""top fans"" a gift or provide customers with an extra incentive to purchase add-ons. Use your strategic Cyber Monday marketing to build loyalty among your best customers or bring in new customers with a unique incentive.

The second step of your strategy is to simplify the sale. Don’t make the user experience any more complicated than it needs to be. This means no complex coupons, different discounting on different items or extensive rules. You want to establish brand recall in the short amount of time you have the consumer’s attention. Your overall messaging should remain consistent across the board so that anyone who comes across your advertising can rattle off your Cyber Monday promotion.

Lastly, know the strategic insight into your customer’s journey. People typically shop with a set holiday list, and your simplified promotion should be at the top of that list. The best way to achieve this priority is to understand your audience on your various platforms. If your email list is entirely existing customers, make sure you send out a message that speaks directly to your loyal fans. If you are targeting a group of people who have never heard of your brand, make sure you address the key selling points of your promotion.

Hyperlocal targeting, the targeting of prospective customers in highly local areas, is an effective method of attracting customers and putting your brand at the forefront of their minds. This method is often used for awareness campaigns when businesses enter new markets but can be just as effective for a specific campaign, such as Cyber Monday advertising.

To attract local customers, you can create a Facebook ad that targets a local audience and uses references and verbiage that’s relatable. Using a lead form ad will allow you to capture their information and send them a coupon code through email. Have fun with this part! Make the coupon code something relatable like a famous zip code, regional cuisine, the street you're located on or something that is memorable to your audience when they see it in their inbox and that makes sense for your business.

If you already have email marketing for your business set up, use it to notify your engaged customers about your upcoming sale. Create an email that goes out to customers with abandoned carts notifying them of your Cyber Monday promotion. This is a great way to close deals with customers who you know are interested in your products. Creating a drip campaign that goes out weeks ahead of time is a great way to keep your business top of mind.

A unique Cyber Monday marketing option is to run a ""page likes"" campaign around a giveaway where you ask users to like your business page, and in return, you message them a coupon code for Cyber Monday. This is a great way to get people who are interested in your product to like your page so that once Cyber Monday is over, you can share recurring content, encouraging them to visit your store or shop online.

Cyber Monday web traffic is the equivalent to crowds rushing into stores on Black Friday to grab those sweet deals. A ton of web traffic all at once sounds amazing, right? Well, receiving an influx of web traffic without preparation can be disastrous for your overall Cyber Monday success.

Time and time again, we have seen large stores go viral on Cyber Monday due to their website being down (we're looking at you, J. Crew and Lowe's). Although it may seem like a good thing to have so much excitement for your promotions that your site crashes, each minute down results in lost sales.

There are a few ways to ensure that your website is prepared for the increased traffic it is sure to gain on Cyber Monday. One method is to be sure you are using high-quality images with compressed file sizes. This decreases loading time for pages that otherwise would be slowed down by large, cumbersome images, while allowing your website or landing page to still be visually appealing.

Another method is to use browser caching on your website, allowing your website to load far more quickly. This essentially stores a copy of everything about your site -- from the images to the style sheets -- so that the next time the user visits the page, it doesn’t need to be loaded from scratch.

You also can use a content delivery network (CDN) to offload static elements of your website at locations in your general region. This way, users have closer server access, shortening load times drastically.

Whether your brand is large or small, product- or service-based, use Cyber Monday as a day to compete on digital platforms where more people are engaged and ready to buy. Implement a strong and creative strategy that will target your buyers and grab their attention. Make sure the message is relatable and appealing for the timing of the content.

If you know what your buyers are looking for and when they're looking (i.e., Cyber Monday), you can better test your marketing efforts and think outside the box.",
"One of the greatest compliments I ever received was when a friend told me that the word I used most was noticed, as in “I noticed that you ______.”

He went on to explain that I pay attention to things, but more importantly, I take action.

Read that last part again: I take action.

Why does this matter?

Because merely observing something makes you a spectator; taking action means you go one step further and use that observation to achieve a purpose and effect positive change.

The former is passive; the latter is proactive.

In other words, it's about using attention and intention to move your life forward.

Let's break down those two essential qualities:

Attention is all about focused effort. It’s about being highly selective with your time and energy and aligning them with your goals. This also means sometimes subtracting things from our lives that distract us from what we want. When you say no to the things that no longer serve you, you can say yes to the things that do.

Paying attention also has the added benefit of demonstrating respect to others. This world has a cacophony of noise. Tons of distractions. A million reasons that make it difficult to be heard. When you actively listen to your boss, colleagues, and clients, you show them that they matter most.

And finally, when you pay attention (and aren't busy multi-tasking), you increase the odds of observing things that others might miss—patterns, errors, or new opportunities. Create an environment where interruptions are minimized, so you’ll be free to take notice.

Intention means you commit to what you want. This is where you swear allegiance to a specific outcome. It's where you translate a lofty goal into something that is front of your mind EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. Doing this involves creating reminders that resonate with you, and it also requires the practice that turns a new idea into a lasting habit.

Here's the thing about intention: it's never wishy-washy. It requires clarity about what you want and what you hope to achieve and then has you create an unshakeable determination to accomplish it. But at the same time, it's open enough to allow alternative—and sometimes, even better—possibilities to emerge. It doesn't let fear to hold it back; it's action-oriented.

Though each is important, the simple truth is this: Attention without intention is meaningless.

Tremendous growth and learning occur at the intersection of attention and intention. When you're in that space, what you observe—and then take action on—can catapult your career. For instance:

Without follow-up, all of these examples would be fleeting thoughts—and missed opportunities.

Remember: attention without intention is meaningless. But noticing things—and acting on them—can make amazing things happen.",
"We've known for a long time that material stuff isn't a path to happiness. It might, however, be a path to decreased business security and success, according to researchers.

As highlighted in the September-October issue of Harvard Business Review, a study led by Robert M. Bushman found that banks with materialistic CEOs had more mortgage-backed securities, noninterest income and loans. Their institutions also had weaker risk management practices, and the CEOs were more likely to support a lax culture with reduced oversight.

On the one hand, as the study authors point out, materialistic CEOs have the opportunity to bring in higher gains if they take more risks. But even the best gamblers lose some of their bets, and in the business world, laying down the wrong hand one too many times can make it impossible for a company to recover, let alone gain industry ground. Lack of oversight also can make it hard to restructure and make corrections when necessary, as it becomes difficult to know who to hold most accountable and discipline. It also doesn't attract investors, who want reassurance that they won't be misrepresented or otherwise abused.

And that might be just the tip of the iceberg. Additional research indicates that materialism has a negative effect on morals and ethics. Drivers of luxury cars, for example, are less likely to yield to pedestrians, and upper class individuals are more likely to endorse unethical behavior at work, lie in negotiation, cheat or take goods from other people. The researchers hypothesize that these results are at least partially accounted for by more favorable attitudes toward greed.

How to leave a materialistic mindset behind

None of this means that, as a leader, you can't occasionally indulge. In fact, you can be a good model in appreciation of quality and craftsmanship. The problem comes only when those indulgences become a requirement for you to feel a sense of personal worth, or when you are willing to compromise others to obtain them.

If you need to shake free of a materialistic mindset, these strategies can be useful:

If you already have anti-materialism strategies that work for you that aren't listed above, don't hold back. Do companies and leaders everywhere a favor and share them in the comments.",
"In a superior customer service culture, it’s understood that serving customers positively and proactively is the default, the expected behavior. These are cultures in which giving great customer service is “simply the way we do things around here.”

One of the forces that sustains this cultural norm is what I call positive peer pressure, a term I’ve borrowed from Pulitzer Prize- and National Book Award-winning author Tina Rosenberg. Generally, of course, we think of peer pressure as being negative. Consider smoking: The way I imagine it, there was only one teenager in the history of teenagers who independently figured out how to cultivate tobacco, cure the leaf, roll it into a cylinder, light it on fire, and repeat the process enough times to get addicted.  The rest of the world’s teens then learned from that one teen, or from each other.

But peer pressure can also be a force for good. Think of what it feels like to walk into a great, customer-focused company.  Your immediate impression is that every employee in the store is here to help achieve a “yes” for you. An employee from one of these great companies (who spoke to me without attribution) credits the “yes” mentality to both the intrinsic positive nature of the people her company hires and the positive peer pressure she feels all around that keeps everyone doing their positive best:

I feel I have this 'yes attitude' within me, and they knew that when they hired me. But also, all around me, my colleagues are here demonstrating this attitude as well–and have been, for the most part, since I started working here. It really rubs off on me when I’m slipping a bit, and I hope my attitude does the same to lift others here up as well. How do you develop the positive peer pressure that can support a default of positivity within your company’s customer service culture? One of the keys is in the quote, above: Strive to hire for this “yes attitude.” Then, reward and support this attitude wherever possible, by talking about the importance of exceptional customer service every day, starting from the first moments of orientation (onboarding); and by catching your employees doing something right for a customer and celebrating that when it happens. After that, this cultural norm should take off on its own–and, through the force of positive peer pressure,  become self-reinforcing.",

In a wide-ranging conversation with author and filmmaker Josh Tickell, 43, he shared two key observations. First, he said that cows get a bad rap for their contribution to global warming. Second, he says millennials are key to solving climate change.

Tickell, a self-described environmentalist, is the author Kiss the Ground and The Revolution Generation. Films by the same titles are also pending release. Tickell’s first film, Fuel, still available on Netflix, won him a Sundance Film Festival award.

As a social entrepreneur, co-founder of Big Picture Ranch, his production company, he says his four-person team operates the business on a break-even basis. You can watch my full interview with Tickell in the video player at the top of this article.

In Kiss the Ground, Tickell looks at soil’s potential to sequester carbon. He notes that each acre of agricultural land has the potential to store up to 10 tons of carbon. Extending that across 10 billion acres of farmland, there is tremendous potential to store carbon there.

Two surprising keys to carbon sequestration in the soil include tilling—actually, not tilling—and running cows over the land.

Tilling is a great way, Tickell says, to release stored carbon into the atmosphere and damage the soil. Modern farming tools and techniques allow for no-till farming methods, where a slice is cut in the ground, seeds are inserted and the open wound in the land is immediately sealed in a fully mechanized way. This isn’t 19th-century farming.

He notes in his book that it isn’t enough to be an organic farmer. Organic farmers who are tilling their land are failing to sequester carbon and build healthy soils just like traditional farmers.

Much has been said in recent years about the methane production of cows and their impact on global warming. Tickell says the problem is in the concentrated animal feeding operations or CAFOs, where about 78% of beef cattle are raised. These factory farm operations do produce tremendous amounts of carbon.

That said, when cows graze in a pasture as a mob, moving from place to place, most of their emissions are stored in the soil--they are constantly converting grass into compost. Not only do they help, but Tickell says, “that's the only way to really create the soil regeneration that's necessary.”

“Not only is it not the cow's fault but for better or worse we can't really build the kind of soil carbon we need without them,” he says.

In The Revolution Generation, Tickell takes a look at millennials and their politics.

“Most people don't realize this, but the millennial generation has the largest voting bloc in U.S. history,” he says.

With respect to solving climate change, Tickell says, “Not only are they the only potential solution. They're our only potential hope.”

He notes that millennials are over 50% independent and that they don’t feel like there is anywhere for them to vote. “The Revolution Generation looks at how can we create new systems that are going to empower young people to make a difference,” Tickell says.

Generation X and the Baby Boomers and become “ideologically infatuated,” he says. “So, if our party believes XYZ we believe XYZ even if that is scientifically not true. So, we have become a party before science society and that's what happens to empires before they fall.”

There is something different about millennials, however. “Regardless of whether they're Republican Democrat or Independent the majority, vast majority, 70 to 80 percent believe that climate change is human-made.” Simply understanding the nature of the problem is critical to solving it, Tickell argues.",
"Customer acquisition is a huge focus for business development teams, and for good reason: Customers can shape your business outcomes. One key way to acquire customers is to invest in a solid branding strategy that projects the right image of your company.

What's the best way for your business to promote its brand to future customers? We asked eight Forbes Business Development Council members to weigh in. Here's what they had to say.

Demonstrate your values and culture when projecting your brand. You are selling to humans, not robots. And you are selling to generations of them. For example, you may have a culture that projects your fair and equal approach to dealing with any customer, no matter what size their business is. That's a value that your brand can stand for, which retains its fresh appeal for customers of the future. - Vijay Sundaram, Zoho Corporation

There isn't a more valuable (or detrimental) representation of your brand than the ethos of your employees and customers. Culture often precedes brand and can positively influence the type and volume of customers that a company acquires. - Elissa Livingston, CloudCheckr

In B2B sales, your field-based workforce is your brand. Do your reps show up on time, look professional, and project the type of brand you want? More importantly, do they show up ready with the required knowledge and skills to leave buyers with a positive impression of your company, solutions and people? An unprepared rep not only loses deals but also tarnishes your brand, so prioritize sales readiness. - Jim Ninivaggi, Brainshark

Building a new brand and gaining meaningful traction can be a challenge in any set of circumstances, but it is especially difficult when playing in a crowded space. Find a niche to play in and you will be better able to carve out a place in the consciousness — and wallet-share — of consumers. - Adam Mendler, The Veloz Group

Clients and customers today seek brands that are authentic. To invest in great brand projection, don’t miss the opportunity to share the brand story authentically on social media. Social media advertising is still underpriced, so take advantage of the opportunity to tell your brand's story now. - Alex Kowtun, Monkey In Paradise Vodka

Being consistent with your message and logos is essential to brand projection. It is super important to have brand standards that are communicated and policed everywhere your brand is presented and shown. Have you seen a purple McDonald's logo? - Wayne Elsey, Elsey Enterprises

7. Engage How Your Customers Prefer To Engage

I spent much of my career in traditional call centers where we transacted over the phone. Today’s customer often doesn’t want to use the phone unless they are frustrated. They prefer SMS, chat and even social channels over a phone call. Yet for some reason, we insist on making them call us, which can increase their frustration. Engage with your customers in the ways they want to engage. - Don Markland, MoneySolver

8. Ask For Customer Reviews After Every Deal

After every closed deal, we automate an email out to the customer asking about their experience with the product and the sales representative specifically. This allows us to get valuable real-time feedback and also utilize positive customer stories to drive acquisition in the future. - Tommy McNulty, Fundera",
"Many marketers in the high-tech industry have struggled with a C-suite that is incredibly protective of the company’s intellectual property and doesn’t want to give too much away, especially online. This is a huge hurdle to combat and requires a creative solution. One tip I can give is to bring back an “old-school” marketing trend: mailer campaigns.

Increasing frustration with the lack of email and voicemail response, despite efforts to be concise, witty and informative, led to my firm’s decision to find a better way. When the idea of a mailer campaign was first pitched to the C-suite and sales team, there was a mixed response, but we knew we had to try something different. For many people, receiving physical mail evokes a certain nostalgia that emails, LinkedIn messages and phone calls simply cannot match.

The sales team got together, picked a target audience and followed specific steps laid out by the marketing team. The response was overwhelmingly positive.

• Determine Key Performance Indicators: Set specific performance indicators before assembly of the mailer even begins. For example, define how many prospective clients and new clients added to the pipeline will make this mailer a success.

• Add A Personal Touch: Include a handwritten note. We have heard from prospective clients countless times that this was a key differentiator when it came to choosing to do business with Elutions over another provider.

• Get Creative: When picking out a branded item to send, make sure it is unique, useful and relevant to the audience. People have received a million branded pens. Try to come up with something more out of the box. One of our most successful mailers is a “Take 5” candy bar campaign. It’s low-cost, and people find it clever when we are asking them to “take 5 minutes” to learn about our value proposition.

• Make It Convenient: Including a one-pager and a two-pager gives the prospective clients options. Our prospective clients are usually in the facilities department, and we know they are always running around. They may only have five minutes to read something, so we rely heavily on graphical representations.

• Provide A Contact: Don’t forget to include a business card! Prospective clients are not mind readers, so include the business card of the sales representative who will be reaching out to them within a few days.

• Connect With Email: When following up via email, try some creative subject lines, such as “Start hunting down the mailman,” or a pun relating to the package you sent. It’s important to remind the prospect that they received something to invoke the social contract and entice them to respond.

Taking the time to send a mailer shows that if your firm will go the extra mile to win their business, you’re likely to do the same when they are a client. It will likely be rare for a prospective client to call you right away after receiving your package -- it’s important to follow up with them first. Make sure that your sales team has a clear communication path for follow-up. Our team creates email and voicemail templates for the sales team to execute on quickly and to make sure the messaging is consistent.",
"A new study by LeanIn.Org and McKinsey & Co. paints a troubling picture about the treatment of black women in the workplace.

According to the Women in The Workplace 2018 survey, women of color are not only significantly underrepresented, they are far less likely than others to be promoted to manager, more likely to face everyday discrimination and less likely to receive support from their managers.

The researchers surveyed 279 companies employing more than 13 million people and talked to 64,000 employees on their workplace experiences. More than 90% of the companies polled said prioritizing gender and racial diversity leads to better business results. Yet only 42% of employees surveyed said they see gender diversity as a company priority and only 22% see racial diversity as a company priority.

Among the concerning survey findings:

If you’re a black working woman in your 50s or 60s and these stats reflect your personal experience, it’s understandable why your frustration level is high. What’s worse, according to the U.S. Census bureau, while a full-time working woman earned about 80 cents for every dollar a man did, full-time working black women earned only 67 cents for every dollar.

What Black Women and Employers Can Do

What can you, and employers, do to combat these workplace disparities?

“Form affinity groups, then contact the CEO directly, saying that you want to be a feedback organization. Then there can be a way to send information about what you and others are experiencing,” says Kim Ashby Fowler, a human resources consultant based in Hempstead, NY.

An affinity group could push for “an equity study on who gets paid what and who is being promoted. You need to get the data so you’re not guessing,” adds Fowler.

Alexis Krivkovich, one of 12 Women in the Workplace co-authors and the managing partner for McKinsey’s Silicon Valley office wants to see employers become more aware of any gender and racial disparities in their workplaces.

“We see companies tracking data on men, women and women of color, but they need to get a lot more detailed in how they are using the data,” says Krivkovich, who helped found the partnership with Leanin.Org and McKinsey and began this annual study in 2015. “Companies need to know how far and how fast their employees are moving in their careers.”

Being the 'Only' at Work

One particular problem women of color often face at work, according to the survey: the double corporate whammy of being both the only woman in the room and the only black, Asian or Latina there as well.

“The impact of being an ‘Only’ is a phenomenon affecting 20% of all women and twice that for women of color where they feel uniquely alone, plus having the scrutiny for representing a whole group,” Krivkovich says. “People who describe themselves as being an ‘Only’ also say they feel more microaggressions in the workplace and more times that their decisions are being questioned.”

In the survey, 51% of “Women Onlys” said they need to provide more evidence of their competence than others do during the normal course of business. By contrast, just 13% of “Men Non-Onlys” felt that way.

There are a variety of ways employers can tackle the Only phenomenon. One obvious solution is to hire women, and women of color, in several areas of the business, instead of using the “one and done” philosophy.

The survey report says: “Real diversity starts with real numbers” early, with new hires.

Networking at work can be useful for black women eager for promotions, too.

Says Camille Hart, employment specialist at Volunteers of America, N.Y.C.: “I run employment readiness workshops for women in shelters re-entering the workforce and one of the tips I give them is to learn how to network with male co-workers so when it comes time to be recognized for a promotion, you are remembered.”

Fowler echoes that view. “Go to events and be an individual contributor,” she says. “Let’s say you give an excellent presentation at a professional event and someone notes what company you work for. That will get back to your manager in a positive way and perhaps improve your position at the company.”

In some cases, experts say, employer and manager biases against black women may be unconscious.

“When we see a lack of diverse representation in a workplace, it’s often because of biases or filters that we may not be aware of,” Fowler notes. She adds: “Some managers don’t know how to support their staff, especially when you add the subtle filters that they may unconsciously have.  In the process, many times there are unspoken ideas on who is worthy and who is valued…a lot of assumptions are made to the detriment of the women of color and the bottom line of the company.”

Paraphrasing Verna Myers, vice president of inclusion strategy at Netflix, Fowler says, “Diversity is like inviting everyone to the party and inclusion is asking people to dance.”

The authors of Women in the Workplace seem to agree that true inclusion has yet to be reached. Based on this year’s survey, they write in the report, it is still clear that women of color “face even more biases and barriers to advancement.”

This disconnect between women of color and their managers does not foster good work relationships and often leads them to think about going elsewhere.

“The good news is that unconscious bias training has been started by some companies to ensure that the people involved in the process of hiring and promotions are trained when it comes to establishing criteria,” says Krivkovich.",
"Think for a second about a firefighter’s courage. When they run into a burning building to rescue people, they don’t necessarily stop and think about whether such a deed is courageous. They just do this because it is part of the purpose of their job—a purpose to which they feel deeply committed.

This was an illustration that American Express CHRO Kevin Cox shared with me to underscore how courage flows from clarity and that this clarity comes from a purpose.

“Leaders who focus in on purpose have the opportunity to demonstrate greater courage,” he said. “They can be a part of something that is bigger than themselves. This has profound benefits on the individuals they lead and organization that they are part of.”

In other words, if we want leaders to be more courageous, then start with the purpose. This is a viewpoint that greatly resonates with me and explains in part why I am so passionate about researching this topic.

Kevin has been a HR leader for more than two decades and I have heard him in numerous environments speak insightfully about the topic of purpose. The below are some highlights from my conversation with him on the importance of purpose both at the individual and organizational levels.

Michael Chavez: Can you tell us about your own purpose journey?

Kevin Cox: I wrote out my purpose on a single page, beginning with the end in mind. It was really a series of arguments with myself about what really mattered. This helped me realize how I should use my time and energy to accomplish what I needed to do. It provided clarity about what I needed to call up the courage to dig into issues, even if it was unpleasant.

There would be times I would take hard stands with my board and senior leaders. I never did this willy-nilly, but rather because I thought it was hard-wired to the purpose and if I wanted to be true to it, I would need to play through some of this pain.

A few books that were helpful in my process were The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen Covey; Howard's Gift: Uncommon Wisdom to Inspire Your Life's Work by Eric Sinoway and Legacy: What the All Blacks Can Teach Us About the Business of Life by James Kerr.

Chavez: How would you suggest leaders get started on defining their own purpose?

Cox: I think there are four key questions to answer: What are your personal aspirations and goals? What are your passions? What are your unique skills and abilities? What is most important to you?

At the intersection of these questions is purpose.

Chavez: I find these questions interesting because they are often in tension with one another. Answering them will take work. What do you think about purpose at an organizational level? Do these questions work?

Cox: You could adapt this to an organization, but it wouldn’t be automatic. I think a CEO could come up this and then bring an organization with him or her. There needs to be a personal dimension driving it.

Chavez: I think some organizations can overemphasize the CEO’s personal vision and overlook the business drivers. I like how the questions you mentioned focus on the abilities as well as passions.

Cox: I might aspire to be a world-class tennis player, but I don’t have the physical gifts. So certainly skills and abilities deserve a voice in this whole discussion. You can decide how much weight it deserves, but it certainly can’t be absent.

Chavez: Can you highlight any insights from the conversations you have about purpose with your colleagues?

Cox: In private discussions, a large number of the senior leaders discuss their goals and objectives. Reflexively, they become tactical and zero in on the near-term. It is left to right thinking – I am here and I am going to move the needle 15 feet over to the right. I try to re-shape the conversation to discuss the end in mind first. How do you want everything to appear after you have moved on? This is not intuitive because of time pressures and performance expectations that tend to shorten individuals’ horizons. I try to stretch horizons further and usually, if we are able to get there, people feel liberated to think bigger and make a greater difference for the organization.

Chavez: Do you think this feels abstract to these leaders?

Cox: It can start that way. I like to ask the question – ‘why did the company put this job on the organizational chart?’ If people think about this, it moves beyond goals and objectives, yet doesn’t sound so lofty.

Chavez: What are the challenges of bringing this journey to a shared place? How do you make this happen?

Cox: Too often, companies that run a portfolio of businesses try to think of an umbrella paragraph that provides meaning for everyone. We try not leaving anything out and then we add words. We think that everyone can see themselves in those words, but then when you stand back, it is too long and not aspirational enough.

To move people around purpose, you need to drill down to the essence. There needs to be more emphasis on feelings and values, rather than logic and rationale. It is difficult to find a “rational purpose”. Purpose should transcend the day-to-day. You can’t be afraid to emote and think about the underlying passions.

Chavez: How have you seen the role of purpose evolve over the years?

Cox: This generation that is rapidly filling up the workforce are more purpose focused and literate than generations past. Their purpose vocabulary is much richer than mine was when I was their age. They are going to work where they feel a connection between some part of their personality and the organization’s purpose and vision. If the organization can’t package that in a tight way, then over time they will lose the best talent to competitors that do this.",
"Funny. True. Applicable to more than just a bad earnings period. (Cramer was using the quote to say that in this unsettled market we'll see which CEOs actually have a credible plan and which ones don't.)

It also reminds me that in times of adversity (when the tide goes out), our true character is exposed.

The best leaders never forget this and know that it's one of the most lasting impressions they'll ever leave. I've seen it over and over. Great leaders memorably separate themselves from the pack when they shine in times of crisis.

I vividly recall two scenarios from my days in the corporate world. In the first case, in the midst of a crisis, I witnessed a frenzied, unfocused leader engage in finger-pointing, yelling, excuse-making, and truth-stretching. It permanently changed how I viewed that leader--and not in a good way. I never forgot the transgression, committed in a time when we most needed strong leadership.

I also clearly recall a second scenario, again in the midst of a crisis, in which I witnessed a seasoned leader act in control, with great humility, clear direction, over-communication, and empathy. It permanently changed how I viewed that leader--for the better--building on an already strong level of appreciation.

You obviously want to be in the second scenario. So, keep Buffett's one-liner top of mind the next time you face adversity. Then, follow the same rules that I try to in times of crisis.

1. Start with the ""five C's.""

Be the eye of the storm. A calm, cool, and collected leader is a beacon. Never forget how many others take cues from you. Be candid but provide reality and hope. Over-communicate. In the absence of your communication, employees will fill in the blanks with worst-case assumptions. Take the time to thank the firefighters fighting on the frontlines. Be brave. Rarely does taking small, incremental steps affect the change needed in times of crisis.

Slow down and simplify the situation. Cut through confusion, and don't underreact or overreact. Your team will step up if they know exactly what the state of the union is. Too many leaders jump from action to action just for the sake of doing something--often losing sight of what's really happening or what's really needed.

Set a big, bright goal that everyone can rally around to see you through the adversity. Assemble a small, nimble coalition of experts for broad problem-solving input but quick action. Roll up your sleeves and flow to the work. With a North Star goal in place, put a detailed plan in place, line up the resources needed, and stay flexible, as things are likely to change.

4. Be visible up the chain and on the frontline.

Your leaders want to know how things are progressing. Pull on that chain of command to help--chains exist to provide added strength in times of need. That's why it's not called a ""thread of command.""

Job number one is to steer the ship back on course. There will be time to constructively learn from who did or didn't do what. And, remember, you and your team really are all in it together. Our mortal enemy is ignorance of the fact that the enemy is external.",
"It’s December. This is the time that many of you are receiving your end-of-year performance reviews, and many supervisors are nervously preparing to deliver them. I’m not sure which organizational aspect career professionals hate more: working on strategy or engaging with the performance management process. When working with teams and organizations in these areas, I frequently meet with resistance and apprehension. To mitigate this, I developed a comprehensive performance management program that organizations apply when they want to create a culture of accountability and alleviate the fear, pain and resistance employees often associate with performance management.

The performance review meeting should not be scary. It should not be a mystery. It should not be punitive, and it should not be held only once per year or once per quarter. Holding a meeting and completing a form during the quarterly or end-of-year meeting is but one factor in the entire performance management process. Here are four other things top supervisors do long before any review meeting to improve the entire process and experience for everyone.

1.  Ensure that an official and transparent performance management system exists and that it aligns with the strategy.

Many organizations don’t even have a true performance management system. They are simply winging it, and this winging it has made most employees come to hate the entire process. I work with organizations to define, develop and institute official performance management systems that align with – and are driven by – stated strategic priorities. This is necessary and important work that executives and supervisors (at all levels) need to successfully embrace before expecting any of their line employees to do so.

Anyone can be busy doing things. Anyone can accomplish something. A performance management system ensures that employees and managers are busy doing the right things and accomplishing the right goals which link to the organization’s strategy. Performance management systems are put in place to ensure performance deliverables remain connected to defined strategic outcomes.

A meaningful performance management process is also a transparent one. Employees at all levels know it exists, and they receive training to understand and appreciate how it will be applied. Top supervisors don’t go around evaluating employees on things the employees didn’t even know they would be evaluated against. Effective supervisors aren’t working to surprise an employee with ambiguous or undefined metrics. Any performance program – no matter how well intentioned – is destined to fail if it does not directly correspond to pre-established strategic priorities and if everyone is not clear on how it all works.

2.  Require employee involvement at all levels of the performance management process.

Effective supervisors establish a collaborative framework from the beginning. The supervisor and employee together review the corresponding strategic and operational priorities as well as the position description. Then they work to clarify major duties and responsibilities for the review period and establish standards for values and behavior. Together, the parties define and agree on what success looks like.

Performance is not only about deliverables. It is also about behavior. Significant attention is placed on what an employee will accomplish and also (maybe even more importantly) how he will go about accomplishing it. This means that the ends do not justify the means. Top supervisors apply performance management systems that provide clear expectations on both “what” needs to be accomplished and “how” it needs to be accomplished. This includes expectations for behavior, team communication and organizational values.

Prior to any performance review meeting, employees should be asked to evaluate their own performance and make recommendations for ratings and rewards as well as challenges and areas for improvement. To ensure a thorough and fair evaluation, the supervisor should seek performance details from other individuals with whom the employee has worked and then incorporate this information into the review.

Effective leaders hold themselves accountable in other areas as well. They intentionally avoid rating pitfalls and biases such as placing too much emphasis on a past performance review, making rating decisions based on how much they like an employee or focusing on the most recent performance deliverables without considering the entire review period. Supervisors can deliver an assessment that leads to truly positive results by sincerely listening during the coaching meetings and then providing the resources necessary for success and removing obstacles that stand in the way of it.

3.  Create a culture of accountability where high performance is distinguished from low performance.

In this Gallup report, more than 54% of employees report that their performance management systems were ineffective. Supervisors who distinguish and reward performance are the key differentiating factor for how employees view the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of their systems.

Everyone is not average. Everyone isn't delivering low performance, and everyone isn't delivering high performance. The best supervisors make performance distinctions. These supervisors have the courage to ensure that high performers are adequately rewarded and promoted up and that low performers are adequately trained or managed out. Employees won’t trust supervisors or the performance management system if they don’t perceive the end results to be fair or equitable.

Top supervisors work to create a culture of accountability at all levels. They steer away from chaos and confusion and work against systems where employees’ performance goals and standards haven’t been clearly defined. You can’t measure what you don’t define so these supervisors will ensure that their employees benefit from having clearly defined performance goals and also know what behaviors they are expected to demonstrate along the way. Systems will be put in place to recognize and reward top performers in a meaningful way.

Coaching occurs when one individual creates a relationship with another to make it easier for him or her to set and achieve individual performance and organizational goals while balancing his or her own needs with those of the organization. It is what happens when one engages in a purposeful effort to maximize performance and more fully develop another to achieve results.

Annual reviews don’t quite work. In organizations where chaos reigns over accountability and performance management is limited to one meeting per year, performance management systems are viewed as subjective and punitive rather than objective and beneficial. When this happens, the entire organization suffers. In order to avoid this outcome, top supervisors hold and document coaching conversations much more frequently throughout the year. These are formal and informal performance discussions with employees and are held throughout the review period (about two times per quarter). Supervisors do this to demonstrate commitment to their employees’ success and to address progress toward established goals and expectations or course correct when necessary.

The coaching conversations are opportunities for employees to inform on what they need to accomplish their goals – what resources do they need provided and what barriers or obstacles do they need to have removed. When this is done right, the supervisor is scheduling dedicated meeting time, discussing defined goals and progress, discussing and documenting resources and barriers, and providing feedback and guidance for success. It is the employee’s responsibility to achieve established goals and demonstrate behavioral standards, and it is the supervisor’s responsibility to help him get there.

If your goal is to be a most effective leader and top supervisor, begin with advocating for the creation of a fully transparent and consistent performance management system that covers the areas I outlined above. Also, as you work to improve dialogue with your team members, incorporate these 11 simple phrases that will help you better demonstrate leadership, transform the culture and execute on strategy",
"Jessica Marquez has always reached for the limitless. As a child her personal mission to find a world beyond her own looked like wanting to be an astronaut. Now, 11 years into a career at NASA, it looks like helping facilitate space exploration as a Human Systems Engineer and Research Scientist at the Ames Research Center.

“Our Human Computer Interaction Group designs and builds software for NASA. We use human-centered designs to make software that is driven by user needs,” explains Marquez. “This means I get to be immersed in the work that others at NASA do — be it training astronauts, controlling the International Space Station (ISS), or learning about future exploration in remote locations like underwater or on volcanoes.”

Focusing in on human connection has ultimately become a common thread through all parts of Marquez’s life. When she moved from Peru to the U.S. to pursue an undergraduate degree at Princeton University, it was finding a community which embraced her that helped her slip into her new identity as a Latina and to embrace the nuances of a career in STEM.

“I strongly believe in the power of representation,” shares Marquez. “Seeing people like you, who share your experiences, doing the very things you want to do — it is empowering. It has empowered me throughout my life.”

Marquez’s involvement with nonprofits like Career Girls, a digital touchpoint with over 10,000 videos of over 500 women in all types of careers, bare witness to the person she is and the change she wants to see both in STEM and within the Latinx community.

Below Marquez shares advice she has for Latinas who are looking to pursue a career in STEM, how she’s navigated community building, and what’s next for her at NASA.

Vivian Nunez: What about pursuing a career at NASA helped you stay focused in a space where there weren't many women or Latinxs?

Jessica Marquez: I have now worked at NASA for over 10 years, and most of my graduate education was funded through NASA grants. In many ways, NASA has been an essential part of my life, affording me many opportunities. Despite the small number of women and Latinxs in my field, NASA is a special place. I get to contribute to making spaceflight exploration happen. NASA’s mission is bigger than me. It is a mission I believe in, that I’m passionate about. That’s probably the biggest reason NASA has helped me stay focused in my career.

Nunez: What advice do you have for Latinas who are looking to pursue a STEM career?

Marquez: My advice to Latinas who are looking to pursue a STEM career is to keep at it! We might be few, but we are here. Over the last few years, so many wonderful Latina women have reached out to me, and I am constantly inspired by them. I also recommend finding mentors – other Latinxs, other women, other men. Find those who will give you good advice and inspire you to be a better person. I may have never chosen to pursue a PhD at MIT if I had not met Professor Dava Newman – she continues to be a wonderful mentor for all these years. Part of the reason I have my current job because my mentor Doug O’Handley introduced me to the right people. Mentors are vital. And most importantly, don’t forget to lean on your family. Educate them on what it is to have a STEM career. Your family will support you in difficult times.

Nunez: What do you think is the difference maker in encouraging more Latinas to pursue careers in STEM?

Marquez: There are many obstacles for underrepresented groups in STEM – from the lack of representation and financial challenges to cultural resistance and gender stereotypes. It is hard when all of these come together. I would encourage other Latinas to really look at all the diverse types of STEM careers. For example, Careergirls.org has more than 500 women role models from diverse backgrounds and ages across all of the major U.S. career clusters. Working in STEM doesn’t have to look like a NASA engineer – it can be using mathematics to understand economics or it can be to use biology to discover a cure for cancer or it can be becoming a YouTube star talking about the next new cool tech.  If you are passionate about STEM, don’t let others dictate what you can be – make it yours.

Nunez: What has been your biggest lesson learned throughout your career thus far?

Marquez: I have had many lessons, many failures, many career disappointments. These hardships will happen, but it is what you do with this experience that makes you rise. You can choose to let it bring you down, or you can choose to learn from it, grow from it, and erase the self-doubts. It is way easier said than done, but you have to believe in yourself. Also, try and surround yourself with people you like working with. Your career takes a long time to build — you want to spend it doing something you love with people that build you.

Nunez: How important is finding a community in order to keep you going in your career?

Marquez: I have learned that you have to participate in multiple communities, some might share your STEM interest, some might share your background, some might be centered around church. Finding your community is important because you want to share your excitement with people who share your passion. They will be a source of companionship, of support, and of advice. It is also where you are able to give back – help others overcome their obstacles. I have mentored a number of women and Latinas studying STEM through my participation in communities. We don’t get here by ourselves; we get here by helping each other. You need different types of communities because they are also essential in advancing your career. I wish someone had told me when I was an undergraduate that networking with my communities would be the way to find my perfect job!",
"Most of us have a boss. Some of us like them.

The “boss” is that person who is ultimately responsible for your status in the organization. They can make or break your career. So too they hold power to continue or bring to an end your employment. Maybe you’re a full-time employee or a contractor. Either way, it is perhaps one of your most important relationships in life. (Hint: it’s much more important than your relationship with your mobile phone.)

Unless you’re a sole proprietor running your own business without a board of directors, there will always be someone that reigns over your employment.

CEOs report into chairs of the board. SVPs report into CEOs. Directors report into VPs. Managers report into directors. Individual contributors, team leads, and other commonly used front-line titles report into managers. It’s been like this for decades. It’s not going to change, either.

The relationship between you and your direct leader can be anywhere from tenuous to fantastic.

Wherever you land on the spectrum, it’s a rather important skill to possess. That is, how do you manage up?

Many people consider the term a derogatory one; “managing up.” Always the contrarian, I beg to differ. If leaders both lead and manage, what’s wrong with you—as the subordinate in the leader-subordinate relationship—managing up? After all, leaders are “managing down,” aren’t they?

First off, be proactive.

Everyone is tasked with projects, deliverables, goals and actions. Nobody likes a surprise. Whether you have good news to report or potentially bad news, your communication strategy ought to be one that is first and foremost proactive. Get ahead of everything and anything. That doesn’t mean being an overly zealous and careless communicator to the point of annoyance. It means to be constantly thinking about where you are at with your tasks, and how/when you will position yourself accordingly with your boss.

Wait, what? That’s right; I said lie. Well, sort of. When managing up, one item to consider is whether you want to tell the entire story. Being proactive is critical, but providing all the gory details may not be a useful strategy. Imagine a performance issue with one of your team members. Perhaps there was inappropriate conduct. Rather than unleashing the entirety of the situation to your boss, ensure they are aware of the generalities of the scenario rather than the specifics. And ensure they know you are on top of it, and the outcome.

Third, ask for their assistance.

A boss always likes to feel wanted, if not needed. Far too many direct reports fail to appreciate their boss’s ego. “They’re my boss,” some will muse, “so why should I stroke their ego?” Well, you should. Period. With any luck, they attained the position of “boss” because of superior performance during their career. (That’s the hope.) There is unquestionably no harm in asking. Some of us believe it’s a sign of weakness with our character or leadership skills. It’s not. It demonstrates respect for your boss, and you might even get something out of it.

In this the age of organizational freneticism, bosses are stressed, overly busy, and constantly trying to find ways to “do more with less.” Budget cutbacks, staff attrition (whether voluntary or involuntary) and constant restructuring are widespread issues that bosses have to handle. Inbox zero has become a dream. 40-hour work weeks are a distant memory. Every now and then I suggest that you offer up your assistance. Perhaps it’s in your 1-1 status review meeting. Maybe it’s in an email (sigh, more emails) or embedded somewhere else. Whatever the mechanism, when you offer to take something off of your leader’s plate—or simply suggesting you have a block of time over the next month, quarter, whatever to chip in—it goes a long way to furthering your relationship. It also demonstrates your sense of empathy.

Fifth and finally, skip past your boss.

Managing up should not stop with your immediate leader. They just happen to be the person directly connected to you via the org chart. I have seen people who occasionally skip past their boss to great advantage. Maybe you can come up with ways in which to physically say hello, be it at the end of a meeting, a town hall session, or even the elevator or parking lot. If you have established a relationship of some sort, you might even contemplate an email that outlines some of your accomplishments. Better yet, you might even highlight creative ideas that could help the team’s (or organization’s) strategy. You could offer your assistance somehow. In any case, you will want to gauge whether to involve your direct leader in any of your interactions so as not to seem rogue or disrespectful.

Managing up is not necessarily a negative concept. Indeed it could simply be another tool in your toolbox of career development.",
"Just as no single person can play a symphony, no single person can drive a business’s success. Successful companies have dedicated, reliable teams of people who work together to create new ideas and work toward goals. Those teams are more than just groups of people — they’re coworkers bonded through hard work, dedication and their shared vision of success. Due to those bonds, teams can hold one another accountable, feel camaraderie and earnestly support each other in times of trouble or success.

Assembling a dedicated, reliable team is the tricky part. How do you know if a person will fit into their assigned role or significantly contribute to your business’s success? Below, 11 members of Forbes New York Business Council share their best hiring tactics for bringing in the best people to join their team.

1. Hire People You'd Like To Spend Time With

All the success I've found has one common denominator — the right team. There's no secret formula, but the best tactic I've used to date is to hire those you wouldn't mind spending time with if you weren't at work. You spend as much, if not more time with your work family than you do with the one at home. – Jordan Rolband, DFO Global Performance Commerce

2. Look For Desire To Learn And Grow

I’ve hired many underqualified employees in the past, all of whom possessed the same quality: the desire to learn and grow. Sometimes people with mediocre talent far surpass those with abundant talent purely because of their desire to be better. I’ve been fortunate enough to work with some really amazing staff, dedicated people whom I appreciated and worked alongside.  – Hoda Mahmoodzadegan, Molly's Milk Truck and F'in Delicious Beverages

3. Let Go Of Ego

The small business owner's ego is often a roadblock to scaling a company. Allow yourself to put confidence in qualified candidates by remembering comparative advantage will always win out. – Tanner Simkins, Complete SET Agency

4. Hire People Who Want To Help Others

I specifically look for team members who are good at their core, want to help others and want to learn. While the skill set they bring to the table is highly important, it’s easier to teach someone new skills than it is to instill strong character. It is also important that someone has the potential to grow as the company grows. – Morris Levy, The Yard

5. Look For Passion And Motivation

When hiring a new employee, the most important soft skills we look for are passion and motivation. In a startup environment, things move at a rapid pace and there are often long days of hard work. Finding employees who are passionate about your mission and your brand is the best way to foster an environment of open communication with a team-first mentality, which will help your company progress. – Yana Zaidiner, Token Payments, Inc.

Our best hires come from our newsletter. We find that people already using our product better understand the mindset and the business, and are motivated to help make the service even stronger. If your business allows, advertise open roles to the people who already love and support what you're doing! – Ludovic Huraux, Shapr

What are the most important qualities in a teammate that cannot be taught or trained? These are the intangibles that drive team synergy and make the sum of the whole greater than the individual parts: character, creativity and charisma. People who bring these to the table not only help create solid teams, but they also tend to be fun and inspiring people to spend our precious days with. – Jonathan Amoia, Sandhill Investment Management

Getting people to move together toward a common goal requires that you let people work in their strengths and create a culture of trust and accountability. Especially when a team is small, we win and lose together, so being able to trust your counterparts and hold them accountable to the vision is important. Once everyone is comfortable being transparent, an organization can really get traction. – Steven Libman, Integrity Holdings Group, LLC

Word of mouth has really been the best asset in acquiring new talent and bringing them into our team. We stay connected with our industry partners and look for people they like and recommend. – Tracey Sawyer, Krause Sawyer

We derived our company's core values by whiteboarding the best qualities our team members embody, then we narrowed those down to six. Those values describe our people and our company as a whole. When interviewing potential new hires, we have them pick two of our core values and describe to us how they embody each one. We also have them pick a third value and tell us how they could improve upon it. – Tom Conlon, North Street

Efficiency is key. Always hire someone who is either going to grow your business with a skill you do not have or give you more time so you can grow your business if it is an admin position. Stop trading your time for money and trade your money for time! – James Giacopelli, Giac Capital, Inc & Giacopelli Accounting and Tax Services, LLC",
"My neighbor recently sent me a video of her 2 1/2-year-old son, Judah, knocking on my front door. In the video, he knocks and calls my name. When I don’t respond, he continues to knock and continues to call my name for quite a few minutes. As he stands there knocking and getting no response, he gets slightly more exasperated. Then he knocks again and says exactly what we all sometimes want to say but often don’t: “Cindy, you hear me?”

We are all guilty of doing what Judah did in the first part of the video. We don’t think we are being heard, so we just keep repeating ourselves. In this case, Judah kept calling my name, and I can assure you it wasn’t going to help, as I was 4,000 miles away in London! I can also assure you it isn’t going to help in a business meeting or office conversation either. The more we repeat ourselves, the more others will tune us out.

Can you think of a time you did this? You're sitting in a meeting and are getting more and more frustrated as you state your concern, and you are either met with silence, excuses or you are completely ignored. So you just keep repeating yourself, often with more and more exasperation.

I’ve done this. I know I’m repeating myself, but I keep doing it anyway. What happens then? You earn the reputation of being repetitive, loud, disruptive and most destructively, of being ineffective or not a team player.

So why do we continue to repeat ourselves over and over again? Why do we continue to observe this behavior even in executive meetings? It’s rather simple: Whether we are 2 1/2 years old or a working adult, we all want to be heard. We are only willing to listen to others (especially our peers and bosses) after we feel heard.

So what can you do about this? Next time you find yourself in this situation, follow the lead of Judah. Pause and ask, “Cindy, you hear me?” Perhaps it should be worded slightly differently in a work conversation or the executive meeting room, but the essence is the same. Ask someone to comment on what you have shared. And I mean ask someone specifically, by using their name, just like Judah did.

It should sound something like this. “I have been sharing some concerns. Tom, can you share your response to my concerns?”

Ask for a specific response. Politely encourage others in the conversation to acknowledge what they heard and to respond. Be assertive, but do not be aggressive. Assertive behavior stems from being confident, positive and forthright. It sounds concise, considerate and firm. On the other hand, aggressive behavior stems from insecurity, negativity and passiveness. It sounds loud, argumentative and even angry.

If you state your position assertively and ask for a specific response from a specific person, and their response still doesn’t address your concern, then it may be time to assess how you are communicating. Perhaps what you think you are saying is not what others are hearing.

Simply repeating ourselves over and over again — “Cindy, are you home? Are you home? Cindy, are you home?” — isn't going to work. Speak your mind assertively and ask for a specific response. Then, role-model listening for the others in the conversation; listen to the response and acknowledge what you heard them say.

This will lead to many productive dialogues.",
"It’s no secret that the demands of the workplace are changing at an increasingly rapid pace. In fact, an Oxford University study found that the “half-life” of job skills has decreased from 30 years in 1984 to just five years in 2014, and the trend has only continued since. This is evidence that the most successful employees in the future won’t be the ones who’ve spent years honing a single skill. Instead, organizations will value the employees who are eager for constant learning throughout their careers.

Upskilling used to be mainly a company-driven effort, but today’s employees need to pick up the torch and take the initiative to improve their ability to deliver value to the organization. As technology contributes to rapid changes in the job market, learning new skills helps workers remain relevant and valued, and it prepares them for a future in which their current roles might even cease to exist.

In addition to future-proofing your worth at work, upskilling can help you discover new talents and passions that you never knew you had. Maybe you learn to code and discover that you enjoy making websites or developing applications, or perhaps you take a personal finance class and develop a mastery of spreadsheets that skyrockets your productivity at work. Not all upskilling opportunities have to seem relevant to your job at first; once you start learning, you’ll be surprised what you can take back to work.

Even if you’ve been in your current role for decades, it’s never too late to start learning something new. To prioritize upskilling, start with these four strategies to help you advance your career.

Turn to part-time training programs that allow you to maintain your primary job while boosting your skill set in a new area after hours. There are ample resources that cater to people with day jobs. LaunchCode, for instance, is a national nonprofit that trains motivated learners for free and then places them in paid apprenticeships once they have the skills necessary to succeed. In fact, 80% of the program’s coders start their career without a degree in computer science. Whether you’re interested in graphic design or social media analytics, you can find a training program for it, including online opportunities presented by local community colleges. With so many diverse offerings, something is sure to appeal to you.

2. Step outside your comfort zone and into a valuable volunteer role.

When hiring managers see volunteer experience on a résumé, they see that you’re a team player. Use volunteer opportunities to show that you’re willing to step outside your comfort zone and adapt to the demands of an unfamiliar environment, all while giving back to a cause you believe in. Volunteer with an organization that ignites your passions, whether you’re helping at a homeless shelter or tutoring at-risk youth. In addition to the benefit of helping others, you’ll broaden your skills and your network, which are both important components to advancing your career.

3. Take the initiative to start a side hustle.

Some people learn best by doing. If that describes you, starting a side hustle or project outside of work will give you the opportunity to pursue a passion or hone a new craft, all while training yourself in the art of being your own boss. Maybe you want to work on your writing skills by starting a blog (which you can monetize by accepting ads or affiliate links), or you’re cultivating your creative side by running an Etsy shop. If you want your venture to stay afloat, you’ll need to learn how to sell yourself and your services. Exploring a new craft and knowing how to market yourself are both crucial for your long-term career success.

4. Prioritize mentorship at work or elsewhere.

More and more employees are looking for mentors—indeed, it’s one of the biggest e-learning trends of 2018. Look for a mentor you trust who has both experience and enthusiasm. Finding a mentor at work can help you learn valuable on-the-job skills, while a mentor in a professional organization outside of work can help you broaden your skill set. Wherever you find it, mentorship is extremely valuable, and it can help you challenge yourself to grow. As positions shift over time, the things you’ve learned from your mentors can help you become more valuable to your current company or more attractive to another company.

Many employees stay in the same jobs year after year. While they might improve a few very specific skills, they’ll be completely unprepared if their role becomes outdated or automated. Make it a point to upskill whenever and however you can. A diverse skill set goes a long way, and it demonstrates to future employers that you’re motivated to learn new things — and that itself is a valuable trait for a job candidate in almost any position.

"The holidays can bring enormous joy--after all, most of us get some time off work, there's great conversation with loved ones, and you get to stuff your piehole with plenty of edible treats. Somewhere between the turkey and the drive home, though, letdown--that horrible, disappointment-laden feeling that the best is over--can creep in. To keep your productivity and health up, you have to wage war on this negative mindset.

Why you feel so yucky, according to science and psychology

Beating holiday letdown means understanding that the holidays are very similar to other goals you might have in your life. Your brain anticipates them, associating them with all kinds of positive rewards. And as your anticipation grows, your body releases chemicals like dopamine that help you feel happy. But once the holiday you've looked forward to is over and done, you're not anticipating anymore, and the chemical reward systems in the brain put on the brakes. You lose your buzz.

On top of this sequence, psychologically, we can get a sense that our connections are breaking, simply because we have to distance ourselves from loved ones again for a while. That feeling can connect to all kinds of deep fears of not having anyone to comfort and protect us. And even the basic understanding that we're leaving something that feels better can awaken a powerful sense of injustice in us. We can feel sad at the world for daring to drive us back to routine and hard effort and creative or recreational confinement.

1. Schedule in lots of small events you like. Each of these give you something else to look forward to, engaging the brain's reward system. Staying busy also gives you less time to ruminate on the loss or disappointment the post-holiday season can usher in.

2. Do something new. Novelty is like candy to the brain, getting dopamine flowing. This is the perfect time to find a hobby, take a few extra vacation days to a place you've never been, or even just take a different route home.

3. Schedule in some conversation. Part of the reason we can feel like connections are precarious after the holidays is that we tend to let interactions with loved ones we've just visited drop off a cliff. (After all, responsibilities, right?) Instead of parting ways with cookie-cutter comments about how everyone should write or call or video chat, set up appointments! Know for sure that there's a commitment, that you have a ""when"". Anticipating these conversations engages your reward mechanisms, too!

4. Keep the buffet going. This isn't an excuse to expand your waistline and slip into another turkey coma. But because our senses are so interconnected, exposure to your favorite tastes and smells can help you retrieve happy memories you associate with the foods. In fact, this is a huge reason why Thanksgiving and Christmas are such emotionally charged holidays. Think outside the usual holiday fare and make some other dish that's been handed down. If you make sure that the recipes have a healthy base, the nutrients and vitamins can make it easier to maintain mood stability, as well.

5. Volunteer. People need help year round, but the holidays can be especially painful for those going through trauma, financial trouble or other problems. They need to feel connected as much as you do. Get out into the community wherever you can and do some good for others, whether that's at the local soup kitchen, your kid's school or offering to snowblow your neighbor's driveway. As you work for others, you'll reaffirm your sense of purpose.

Post-holiday blahs are normal, but they're totally controllable. Let these tactics be a bridge to the next season, and then tackle your new year like the lion(ess) you are.",None
"We have all been in conversations where the other person is distracted. It feels like you're talking to the wall. For one reason or another, i.e. emails, cell phone, etc., they seem to be on another planet all together. It's frustrating.

They claim to have ""heard you,"" but would be hard-pressed to repeat back what you said or articulate the meaning behind your message. When they do give you advice, it makes no sense at all.

In addition to employees feeling discounted in these situations, vital information is being missed, and people are receiving poor direction and feedback as a result. For managers looking to coach their employees, the ability to listen intently is critical.

According to a Holmes (a voice of the global PR industry) report, the cost of poor communication has hit an overwhelming $37 billion. Also, 400 surveyed corporations (with 100,000 plus employees in the U.S. and U.K.) estimated that communication barriers cost the average organization $62.4 million per year.

When we think about communication, we focus more on the outgoing message. However, communication is a two-way street. You have to listen just as much as you speak.

If there were an advanced course in listening, then it would be called Active Listening. The main difference being your level of concentration -- and, the responses that come as a result.

1. Be in the moment.

It's easy to enter conversations, especially of a performance nature, filled with preconceived ideas. An employee is under-performing and you believe it's because they lack prioritization skills. You may be right, but you may also be wrong.

Instead of only hearing information that validates your preconceptions, be mentally present. Use questions to uncover the root cause and make it a priority to understand what the other person is going through. Try to enter the conversation in an open position and stay present so that you can be of service to your employees.

Control what you can control. If the only way to eliminate distractions is to remove yourself from your office, then do it. Emails, texts and watch notifications may happen quickly, but breaking eye contact and interrupting the other person even for a moment, breaks their trust. It sends the signal that there are more important things you would rather be doing than listening to what they are saying -- and they'll shut down as a result.

Distractions prevent you from being mentally present. By eliminating them, you increase the likelihood of a productive and engaging conversation. If there is no way around it, then let the other person know that you're expecting a call, or that your child's babysitter may need something. Worst case, reschedule the meeting or ask if the other person can come back when you're less distracted.

3. Be engaged in the conversation.

Practicing cues that show you're listening is awkward. I'm pretty sure there's an Office episode on that. Rather than forcing uncomfortable eye contact and obsessive nodding, just focus on being mentally present and removing distractions. At that point, the cues will be natural byproducts of your full investment in the conversation.

You don't want to make assumptions or give misguided feedback. If an employee says something that's unclear, then ask for clarification. The best way is to repeat back what you think they're saying. For example, ""what you're saying is..."" or ""if I heard you correctly...""",
"If you want to see how far into the weeds test-centered schooling can go, then take a trip to Florida, where some folks are worried that four-year-olds are not experiencing enough rigorous testing.

Florida has a vast assortment of voluntary pre-kindergartens (VPK) that can get money form the state if there is sufficient proof that they are getting the job done. That measurement is done by the Star test, a readiness test given in the fall of the kindergarten year. Many states and school systems use a similar test, usually so that kindergarten teachers can get a sense of what they have to work with. But in Florida, the test is also used to measure the effectiveness of the VPK and, in turn, whether it gets paid or not.

There were some extra glitches in the first go-round. See if you can spot the problems with the following sequence:

Summer of 2017--State of Florida decides which test to use.

Spring of 2018--state discovers almost half of VPK students did poorly on the test.

There's the huge gap between the end of VPK and the taking of the test. Three months is 5% of a kindergartner's life, a long time to remember school things.

More notably, the VPK providers did not know what test their littles would be taking, and so they were unable to prepare their students for that test. But that underlines one other huge problem with this system--we are now expecting four-year-olds to spend part of their days doing test prep. One of the first things we are teaching the littles is how to take a test.

And just in case this doesn't seem driven all the way into Weedland, note that five-year-olds take the Star assessment on computer. So preparing for the test includes getting four-year-olds comfortable with screens, despite the fact that screen time for littles is, at a minimum, controversial.

Many early childhood education experts had serious misgivings about the Star assessment and its use for this purpose, but once the results came out, opposition became far more vocal. A letter calling on Florida to scrap the Star assessment was co-signed by the United Way of Florida, Florida Head Start Association, The Children’s Forum, the Florida Association for Child Care Management, the Florida Family Child Care Home Association and the Children’s Movement of Florida. Critics are calling for an observation-based assessment that factors in growth, which is essentially the antithesis of the Star test.

Every classroom teacher understands that if the majority of a class flunks your test, the problem is in the test, or you, but not in the students. Florida is in a similar position. If your test is telling you that the majority of littles are not ""ready"" for kindergarten, then the problem is in your kindergarten or your assessment, but not in your children. As writer and education expert Yong Zhao has suggested, we should not worry about whether our five-year-olds are ready for kindergarten, but ask if kindergarten is ready for our five-year-olds.",
"My research shows that around 23% of people have a high achievement drive. People with a high need for achievement seek to excel. They feed their hunger for achievement not by being better than other people, but rather by continually reaching for a higher level of personal best. They avoid low-risk situations and easily attained success and instead seek out difficult and demanding goals that challenge them to grow and develop in all sorts of new ways.

Given this motivational profile, how can you make your performance reviews with achievement-driven employees incredibly successful? Here are three techniques:

Achievement-driven people appreciate success, but they derive true satisfaction from the demanding pursuit of that success. Wins are celebrated, but they don’t sit long on their laurels before they’re off and running towards a new and challenging goal. Difficult goals light up the brain and push us towards greater performance, and it’s this experience that the achievement-driven person desires.

Goal difficulty is not based on the quantity of goals, but rather on these three factors that test goal difficulty:

1. I’m really going to have to learn new skills before I’ll be able to accomplish this goal. (The single most important issue to address when assigning difficult goals to high performers is: are they learning new skills?)

2. My goal is pushing me out of my comfort zone; I’m not frozen with terror, but I am on pins and needles and wide awake.

3. When I think of my biggest and most significant accomplishments, this goal is at least that difficult.

Unfortunately, we know from the online quiz ""Do you set SMART Goals or HARD Goals?"" that nearly 50% of people will not have to learn new skills in order to accomplish their goals for this year. Achievement-driven employees, who want the learning challenges that HARD Goals provide, find this especially demotivating.

So when you’re conducting performance reviews for these folks, give the goal-setting portion of the conversation extra attention. And make sure that the goals you set (ideally with the employee’s input) are difficult enough to demand the learning of new skills. If not, you’ll be giving your achievement-driven people a boring and perfunctory exercise that won’t stimulate or inspire them. We know from the study ""Are SMART Goals Dumb?"" that only 42% of workers say they are always or frequently learning on the job while another 39% percent say they are never or rarely learning. Clearly this is an issue that does not receive enough attention.

Achievement-driven individuals love being evaluated and graded, and frequent feedback helps them to monitor their progress. They welcome constructive criticism, but also want recognition for their good work via sincere praise that targets their specific accomplishments. They also desire hard metrics by which they can chart their progress and verify their achievements.

So when you’re conducting their performance reviews, be very careful not to give imprecise and nebulous feedback. For example, phrases like ""great job"" or ""nice work"" are so vague as to be virtually useless. And in some cases, these kinds of phrases may even do harm.

Let’s imagine that one of your achievement-driven employees did a great job closing deals this past quarter. What made their work great? Well, perhaps they made twice the number of phone calls than their colleagues. They did great and hard work, and now you come along and say, ""Great job.""

If you recall what makes achievement-driven people tick (being great, getting graded, having hard metrics, etc.), you’ll understand why “great job” is problematic. First, vague feedback doesn’t acknowledge that we understand everything that the employee accomplished (i.e. made twice as many phone calls). Second, it doesn’t sound like we appreciate everything they accomplished. And third, the phrase ""great job"" has little pedagogical value. It doesn’t teach the employee which of their terrific behaviors you want to see repeated in the future (making those extra phone calls).

Most achievement-driven people thrive in a culture where they can stand out and be great. You can influence your culture in this direction by encouraging a more meritocratic environment that embraces friendly competition, values creativity and intelligence, and where the best performance wins regardless of status or tenure.

When executives think about improving employee engagement, they often envision creating a highly social corporate culture. They imagine a workplace with a friendly, relaxed atmosphere where the lines between professional and personal relationships are blurred. A culture where managers are just another part of the team and where collaboration and teamwork are paramount to success. And many of the efforts behind these visions of engagement want every employee to have a great friend at work, to ensure that everyone has someone who cares about them, and that everyone is happy.

Now, that kind of social culture can certainly have high levels of employee engagement. However, it represents only one type of corporate culture, and surprisingly, it’s not the type of culture that fosters the highest levels of engagement, especially for achievers. Meritocratic cultures have higher employee engagement scores than any other type of culture, including the social culture.

So if your Achievement-driven employee had higher performance, let their scores reflect that. Don’t cap or constrain their reviews; let them shine. Similarly, if their performance wasn’t as good as it could have been, don’t try and buffer the news. Achievers aren’t looking for empty platitudes; they want candid feedback and evaluations based on real-life performance.",coaching
"Over the past few decades, we've come to glamorize the garage (or WeWork) startup. These days, parents take the same pride telling their neighbors that their progeny have gone to work for some fledgling enterprise that they used to have when they started a job at IBM or General Electric. Today's celebrity CEOs tend to be founders.

We can expect that to change in the years to come. The end of Moore's law will mean that the technologies of the future will be far more complex, less understood and more capital intensive. Large, well resourced organizations, including government entities, are much better positioned to develop these technologies than startups are.

However, this will be no return to the age of robber barons. One thing the last few decades have taught us is that walled gardens are a fool's errand and cloud computing has made them even less tenable. So it's becoming increasingly important for large enterprises to partner with entrepreneurs and vice versa. Collaboration is quickly becoming a key competitive advantage.

Over the past few decades, we've been in the midst of a digital revolution. Every few years, a new generation of chips would emerge, opening up new possibilities. Firms would scramble to leverage these new, more powerful technologies by creating new applications, identifying new markets and coming up with new business models.

This state of affairs favored small, agile firms that could move product ideas to market quickly, through a process of rapid innovation. Product cycles became incredibly short and, rather than spending a lot of time and effort optimizing before the product was even out the door, the policy of perpetual beta became the norm.

The myth of Silicon Valley is that this is the best, if not the only, way to develop technology. The truth is that the Silicon Valley model of venture funded entrepreneurship is particularly suited to certain kinds of technologies, such as software and consumer gadgets, that can be rapidly prototyped and iterated.

With Moore's law ending, there will no longer be a consistent stream of more powerful chips to fuel the digital revolution. We'll have to learn to use new computing architectures, such as quantum computing and neuromorphic chips and apply them to new technologies, such as genomics, materials and robotics (including AI).

Make no mistake, we are entering a new era of innovation and we will need to adapt. You simply can't rapidly iterate a quantum computer, a lifesaving cure or a revolutionary new material. We're going to have to learn to think more in terms of grand challenges and less in terms of hackathons.

We often think of innovation as a single event, but the truth is that it's a process of discovery, engineering and transformation. With respect to digital technologies, we have long past the major discovery phase and are nearing the end of the major engineering phase, yet we still have quite a bit of transformation in front of us, as existing technologies are implemented in the marketplace.

It is the scale of large organizations that makes them uniquely positioned for the transformative phase. To understand how, take a look at Walmart. In recent months, the company has announced two major technology initiatives. One, utilizes blockchain to improve food safety and another uses VR to train associates in stores.

Notice that neither of these initiatives entails much technological wizardry. In fact, Walmart isn't developing technology at all, but using suppliers to implement it. However, both are immensely transformative. For Blockchain, Walmart is not only adopting the technology, but also pushing suppliers to do so as well. For VR, it is taking a futuristic technology mainstream.

I believe that many of the headlines we will see over the next year will be similar in nature. With advancement in digital technology slowing to a crawl, there is still great potential to implement emerging applications on a truly massive scale. That's no small thing. It will have enormous impacts on how we live and work.

Yet more recently, the big guys have learned how to leverage the cloud to improve their business as well. ""We've learned that the elasticity of the cloud benefits large enterprises like Experian,"" Barry Libenson, the company's CIO told me. ""We don't want to build the church for Easter Sunday, so having nearly unlimited resources on-demand is a real advantage.""

""We're also finding that our customers will pay for access to our data through APIs and that's opening up new opportunities for us as a business,"" he continues. ""Large enterprises are uniquely positioned to capitalize off of this new API economy, because they've been building resources, in some cases for decades, and now they have the means to distribute these assets through the cloud and profit from them.""

There's also a comprehensive cloud ecosystem that's emerged that's made it easier for large firms to adapt to the cloud. Firms like Apigee and Mulesoft help companies set up and manage APIs, while the rise of no-code platforms allow front-line managers with little or no technical expertise to design their own apps and unlock value in an organization's data assets.

What's interesting is that the cloud has not benefited large firms at the expense of small ones. In fact, just the opposite. The cloud allows small firms to market and distribute software to big customers more easily and access their data to build their own applications.

The mantra of the digital age has been disruption. Because of the stability, low-cost and ubiquity of digital technology, a few guys in a garage or co-working space could invent a product or service that would challenge major multinational firms. With venture capital relatively cheap and accessible, they could scale their business quickly and become giants themselves.

The future will look different than the past, because the technologies that will power advancement will be far less understood, much more expensive to develop and not amenable to rapid prototyping or iteration. They will largely exist in physical, rather than virtual, environments and will be subject to all of the inherent messiness and regulation of the real world.",
"A majority of women believe exclusion is a form of bullying in the workplace, according to a survey of more than 1,000 workers in the U.S.

This is in direct contrast to majority of men who don't believe that exclusion is a form of bullying in the workplace.

The EY “Belonging Barometer” study reveals how U.S. workers define belonging, what makes them feel like they belong at work and what makes them feel excluded in the workplace.

Karyn Twaronite, EY's global diversity and inclusiveness officer, believes that the root of this exclusion for women likely lies in the unconscious exclusion that can become a bad habit formed when they are excluded from one meeting, which can turn into several meetings.

In terms of belonging, one-third of respondents feel the greatest sense of belonging at work ahead of their physical neighbourhood (19%). More than half of respondents feel they belong most at work when they feel trusted and respected, with baby boomers feeling this way the most at 63%, compared to Gen X at 56% and millennials at 53%.

The EY study unearthed a distinct sense of social isolation among U.S. workers: 40% of respondents across generations and genders feel physically alone or ignored. Twaronite argues that the disruption caused by new technologies has led to an increased sense of isolation and stress, particularly among younger generations.

What can organizations do to address employees' sense of social isolation? “We believe that true belonging can only happen when people across all generations and levels band together and lead inclusively,” said Twaronite.

We recommend organizations set the tone from the top, cascading awareness about the importance of employees' individual differences across the firm and recognizing and rewarding both diverse and inclusive role models. We also encourage all employees to learn about each other and value each other's differences. Workplaces can encourage courageous conversations so that colleagues can learn from each other's experiences.”

The study also uncovered that across generations, all employees preferred “check-ins” to actions such as public recognition, being invited to office events or being asked to join a meeting with senior leaders.

Twaronite remarked that employees felt that checking-in with colleagues was more important than ever.

Managers and leaders should keep in mind that making a personal connection with colleagues can go a long way when it comes to fostering a sense of belonging within the workplace. Leaders may also want to acknowledge that events and incidents that happen outside of the workplace can impact each of us deeply and the concerns and emotions that result don't just disappear when we begin our work day.”",coaching
"Culture is the stealth force of organizational behavior. Positive cultures can lift people to higher levels of  performance, while negative cultures can deflate even high-performing people. There's little doubt that ""culture eats strategy for breakfast,"" as Peter Drucker famously put it. But what can leaders do to create a culture that doesn't eat its own people?

""I am giving you these comments because I have very high expectations and I know you can reach them.""

That was the key finding by a research team at Stanford, Yale and Columbia after analyzing two different sets of feedback provided to students by their teachers. Some students received only generic comments on their papers, like ""good job"" or ""nice work,"" while others got something more: the 19-word encouragement scrawled on a Post-It note.

It turns out that this small gesture paid big returns, especially for students of color: 72 percent voluntarily revised their papers, compared to just 17 percent who just received the generic feedback message. Not only that, but the students who got the Post-It note also received better overall grades on their work.

The research highlights a significant lesson for leaders trying to build more positive cultures inside their own organizations: Great cultures are marked by great caring. Tucked inside those 19 words are three specific lessons for building and sustaining a culture of caring.

As the Post-It note study makes clear, people rise or fall according to our expectations. Setting the right challenge point -- one that lies just past their current performance level but remains within reach -- is the first way leaders create a culture of caring. Telling your employees that ""I have very high expectations"" not only shows that you know you them well enough to pinpoint their strengths, but also demonstrates that you trust them to meet that level of excellence.

When leaders communicate high expectations, they articulate a clear vision of what success looks like and how others can go about achieving it. With the successful completion of one challenge point comes another, creating a virtuous cycle of aspiration and execution.

Rather than issue top-down directives, leaders work in tandem with their people to create a series of personal missions that allow employees to feel more connected to the broader mission of their teams and organizations. And that sense of connection fuels belonging and contribution, the feel-go and do-good drivers of positive culture.

Many leaders aren't comfortable giving critical feedback, which is why the first part of the Post-It note (""I am giving you these comments"") is so important. Providing regular feedback, even when it's difficult to share, can provide a much-needed boost to performance and is the reason, according to research by Zenger-Folkman, that employees favor it by a margin of three-to-one. Ultimately, we give feedback to the people that matter to us. Creating that dialogue with employees helps builds a culture of caring.

Instead of running through a litany of past mistakes that employees can no longer change, leaders should make time and room for employees to sketch their own way forward. By asking more questions and listening with greater attention, leaders can turn feedback from a trial into a partnership -- and with that change in tone and trajectory, foster greater optimism, trust and respect.

Holding people to a high standard and facilitating their growth shows leadership engagement, but a true culture of caring emerges when leaders provide continuous support to their employees. Whether that takes the form of just-in-time learning opportunities, additional training resources or even a spontaneous perk, employees feel more connected and cared for when these gestures are ongoing.

Which is why the final encouragement of the Post-It note (""I know you can reach them"") may be the hardest to demonstrate. Building and sustaining a culture of caring demands steadiness, sensitivity and sacrifice. It requires leaders to check their own assumptions about what their employees need to be successful and to seek input on how they can best support them. Unless leaders can demonstrate that level of commitment, they shouldn't expect their employees to show it, either.",
"Regardless of which side of the aisle you sit on, the fact that more than 100 women were elected to Congress this midterm election is sensational for all of us . The historic implications of this are profound enough given the number of precedents these women are setting. But the practical implications for what could actually now happen in Washington are to be celebrated.

In my 10-year study on what makes great executives, one of the most common questions I’ve received was whether or not there were material differences between men and women. I looked at five years of data regarding the differences between male and female leaders, from sources such as Calipers Research and Dr. Helen Fisher. The four capabilities uncovered in our 10-year study closely correlate to the strengths of women leaders consistently identified in the gender difference research. Obviously not every female leader will be predisposed to excel in all of them, but in the aggregate, it makes a compelling case for female leadership. As an executive leadership consultant for more than 30 years, having coached scores of men and women executives, my personal experience suggests that when it comes to leading in environments of complex problems, intractable conflict, and significant high-stakes visibility, women are just better at it.

When I think of what the ideal job of a congressional legislator ought to be (vs. what it has devolved to), it gives me great hope to consider that many more women, especially new legislators with great leadership experience, might rise to the role as it was intended to be performed. And that bodes well for us all.

Here are three capabilities that research on women in leadership reveal as more represented in women leaders, and that closely correlate to our original research. They represent the kind of leadership Washington is desperate for. And I suspect this cohort of newly elected women legislators will show up and school the incumbents on how this could be done better .

Legislators need to see past political obstacles to the possibilities for real change. According to Zenger Folkman’s study of more than 16,000 leaders’ 360 feedback reports over a two-year period, women overall show more effectiveness at the executive levels, where seeing opportunities for growth and change is most significant. Moreover, in the competencies of taking initiative, driving for results and championing change, women outperformed men by statistically significant differences. Tenacious and persistent, the best women leaders can see beyond obstacles to push boundaries and get things done. They remain focused until objectives are achieved. They enjoy stretching their perspective to broaden their observations. As this Congress now takes on issues like immigration, health care, and the environment, getting past historically petty stalemates and pushing to needed solutions will likely come more adeptly to these women.

Legislators must stop vilifying each other and learn to collaborate. Who isn’t sick of the scarecrow arms across the aisle blaming “them” for why things can’t get done? Honestly, if any of us in the private sector made the same excuses for not doing our jobs as they do, we’d all be out of jobs. Approval ratings for congressional performance remain hovering at an abysmal 17%. Before the congressional calendar was changed years ago, Congress stayed in Washington for longer periods of time, where more natural patterns of collaboration could happen. But with legislators spending less time in Washington, and therefore less time with each other, they don’t get to know each other, appreciate their differences, and learn how to collaborate more effectively. With a House of Representatives now controlled by Democrats and a Senate controlled by Republicans, America sent a loud and clear message to Washington: We expect you to figure out how to work together. Of course the cynical predictions are for two years of gridlock until the 2020 elections. Here again, the presence of that many more women in both legislative bodies gives us a glimmer of hope for something better.

According to Gallup’s survey of more than 11,000 people, women are more likely to build collaborative environments than their male executive counterparts. This allows them to strengthen the connections among various constituencies that might otherwise remain disparate. The result is greater breadth, where differing factions become strategically linked and things function more cohesively. Further, according to the research by Helen Fisher, “Women have what scientists call 'executive social skills.' [Their brains] have evolved a keener ability to pick up the nuances of posture and gesture, read complex emotions in faces, and hear slight changes in tone of voice.” Because of this, women are specialists at cultivating relationships of depth and trust.

Legislators must become effective problem-solvers. One of the most tragic failures of the congressional role is that it has eroded to nothing more than self-interested horse trading. The corruption of special interests and PAC influences, and the way bills sent to the House and Senate floors are piled high with bartered deals, so much so that you can’t even decipher what the legislation is actually trying to accomplish. If legislators had more effective problem-solving tools, knew how to focus on building solutions instead of just cutting political deals through negotiations that trade off one constituent's needs for another, things could actually get done. Here again, more women in legislative roles offers us the possibility for something better.

According to researcher Helen Fisher, “When women cogitate, they gather details somewhat differently than men. Women integrate more details faster and arrange these bits of data into more complex patterns. As they make decisions, women tend to weigh more variables, consider more options, and see a wider array of possible solutions to a problem. Women tend to generalize, to synthesize, to take a broader, more holistic, more contextual perspective of any issue.” Moreover, many women are particularly skilled at soliciting and listening to multiple, diverse voices. They are more inclined to integrate team contributions after encouraging everyone to participate. They will not decide until ideas have been heard, reflected, and tested. Further, their results orientation allows them to reach decision closure more efficiently and execute more effectively.

By no means do I remotely mean to suggest that these 100-plus women are a silver bullet to fix all the ills of Washington politics. Nor am I naive enough to think that an improvement in the gender balance of our legislative branches suggests we’ve made more strides than we actually have when it comes to adequate representation of women in leadership roles. To be sure, we’ve got a long way to go on both fronts.

But these 100-plus women headed to Washington give me reason to hope for something better in the face of my temptation to be cynical about all of our national leaders. It’s a great start, and I for one will be cheering them on for the next four years.",
"With nearly 57% of the votes, Nevada just became the 10th state to eliminate the “tampon tax” a.k.a. the ""pink tax"", following the example of New York, Massachusetts, Florida, and others. Adding the five states that don’t have a general sales tax - Delaware, Alaska, Montana, New Hampshire and Oregon, plus the District of Columbia - there are now 15 states that don’t tax feminine hygiene products, like menstrual pads and tampons.

The people of Nevada voted to eliminate the 6.85 percent sales tax on feminine hygiene products. Proponents of its elimination argue that menstrual pads and tampons are necessary products such as bandages and splints, which are categorized as “medical devices”, and are therefore exempt from state taxes.

Ashley Spivak, co-founder of Cycles and Sex, a media platform and ecosystem that offers reproductive and cycle education and resources, said “Hopefully this win will serve as a model for other states to follow suit. If the reason for exempting products from sales tax is because they are considered essential, it’s hard to understand that period products don't automatically fit into that category."" Suzanne Siemens, CEO & Co-Founder of Lunapads, added: “Taking a stance on regressive pink taxes shows voters you are listening and willing to dismantle historic patriarchal design biases in our economic system.”

Period products are a basic need for all women and transsexual men, usually from around age 12 until 50. It is, therefore, a substantial financial imposition, particularly for younger people and underserved communities.

Question 2 and the policy change in Nevada is one more step in a broader country-wide movement for “menstrual equity.” Maria Molland, CEO of THINX Inc. said: “Nevada just made a strong statement about the importance of menstrual equity by repealing the tampon tax. Access to period products is an absolute necessity for all people to fully participate in our society.” Laura Blackburn, giveback manager at THINX, emphasized that this tax ultimately places an extra financial burden on women, who already earn less than men.

Whether Pro or Con, Financial Reasons Abound

Opponents of the so-called “pink tax” across the nation point to the losses in income tax for the states, which could affect local and state public services, as explained in The Nevada Independent. The publication estimated that eliminating the ""tampon tax"" would result in a loss of between $6 million and $8.5 million in tax annually for the state of Nevada, according to fiscal analysts.

The ballot initiative was first proposed by Democratic state Sen. Yvanna Cancela, who pointed out that this was “a pretty small amount in comparison to the rest of the budget.” If we calculate the tax loss at $14 million over a two year period (hint!), that would represent only 0.17 percent of the entire current budget of $8.1 billion, approximately.

Claire Coder aims to solve the same problem, but in a different way, proposing that menstrual products should be offered in all public bathrooms free of charge.

Shedding light on menstruation is generally positive, but I am concerned about the greater conversation. I believe that it is important for tampons and pads to be viewed the same as toilet paper. They are both necessities that respond to basic bodily functions. Thus, menstrual products should be taxed the same way that toilet paper is. Additionally, menstrual products should be offered in all public bathrooms at no charge, the same way that toilet paper is offered - Claire Coder.

There is substantial controversy about how to solve the “pink tax” issue and for a good reason. But for female-identifying founders, the status quo is not an option any longer. This is one piece on the female equity puzzle, and it’s part of a much larger conversation aimed at unpacking why products marketed to women are more expensive than the equivalents for men.

The debate is served free of tax, and women are done with inequality. Period.",
"My article earlier today argued that President Trump’s appointment of Matthew Whitaker to oversee the Mueller investigation is unethical and requires recusal. Neal K. Katyal (acting solicitor general under President Barack Obama) and George T. Conway III (a litigator at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz in New York) make the case in the New York Times that the appointment is also unconstitutional.

The Appointments Clause of the Constitution, Article II, Section 2, Clause 2, states that “principal officers of the United States” must be nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate under its “Advice and Consent” powers.

Katyal and Conway point out that what makes an officer a principal officer is that he or she reports only to the president. The Attorney General reports only to the president and is therefore a principal officer. By contrast, Robert Mueller, the Special Counsel, reports to the Attorney General or his deputy and is therefore what is known as “an inferior officer,” for whom Senate approval is not required. Under the Constitution, which overrides other legislation, a principal officer must be confirmed by the Senate.

This means that Mr. Trump’s nomination of Matthew Whitaker as acting attorney general, with the obvious intent of affecting the Mueller probe, is unconstitutional, i.e. illegal. Anything Whitaker does, or tries to do, in that position is therefore invalid and can be challenged by any litigant with standing.

This is not just a technicality. The appointment of Whitaker flouts one of the explicit checks and balances set out in the Constitution, whose very object is to protect against the rule of law.

Katyal and Conway cite the opinion Justice Clarence Thomas who wrote that the Constitution’s drafters “recognized the serious risk for abuse and corruption posed by permitting one person to fill every office in the government.”

Trump’s appointment of Whitaker is precisely the kind of attempt to evade the Constitution’s very explicit, textually precise design.

Senate confirmation exists for a simple, and good, reason, write Katyal and Conway. Constitutionally, Matthew Whitaker is a nobody. His job as Mr. Sessions’s chief of staff did not require Senate confirmation. (Yes, he was confirmed as a federal prosecutor in Iowa, in 2004, but Mr. Trump can’t cut and paste that old, lapsed confirmation to today.) For the president to install Mr. Whitaker as our chief law enforcement officer is to betray the entire structure of our charter document.

It is possible that in times of crisis, interim appointments need to be made. But even so, if it did, “there are officials at hand, including the deputy attorney general and the solicitor general, who were nominated by Mr. Trump and confirmed by the Senate. Either could step in as acting attorney general, both constitutionally and statutorily.”

Because Mr. Whitaker has not undergone the process of Senate confirmation, write Katyal and Conway, there has been no mechanism for scrutinizing whether he has the character and ability to evenhandedly enforce the law in a position of such grave responsibility. The public is entitled to that assurance, especially since Mr. Whitaker’s only supervisor is Mr. Trump himself, and the president is hopelessly compromised by the Mueller investigation. That is why adherence to the requirements of the Appointments Clause is so important here, and always.",
"Thanksgiving for those outside of the US is more simply known as 'that gratitude holiday' – the day where families come together to give thanks. Whether people are well-versed in the history of the holiday or not, the sentiment of coming together to pay your appreciation is a valuable idea.

And in more ways, than you may think (it’s not just about the good food and conversation).

Numerous studies show the benefits of expressing gratitude, ranging from improved sleep, less pressure on your heart, and even boosts to immunity. And it’s not just for the ‘healthy, well-adjusted’, it can have a valuable impact on those struggling with mental health conditions.

Here’s just 3 reasons why you should spend time being grateful today:

This time of year can be stressful. Schedules are filling up at year-end, work targets are looming, and the social pressures mounting.

Practicing gratitude has been shown to reduce stress levels and behaves almost like a ‘muscle’ meaning practicing gratitude even for one day will make it easier for the feeling to return on another day. Putting in a bit of practice today could build that relaxation in as the busy season crescendos.

If sleep were a food it would sit squarely in the superfoods column. The health benefits are clear – it plays a critical role in immunity, learning and to keep your body functioning, and even reducing the risk of depression. And, as it turns out, gratitude fuels that power.

The idea is that when you’re expressing gratitude and appreciation, you’re focusing on more positive thoughts and therefore in a more relaxed state – much more conducive to high-quality sleep. According to the psychology professor and gratitude expert Robert Emmons, you could even gain an extra half hour of quality sleep.

Oprah Winfrey often talks about there being only two emotions in life: Love and Fear. When we’re stuck in overwhelm and stress, we’re focussing on fear and what we’re most afraid of.

When we’re experiencing the joys of life, calmness, laughter, we’re in a state of love. Yet if you’ve ever tried to flick the switch whilst you’re mid-argument you’ll realize how hard it can feel in the moment.

That’s because our experience of fear and love both stem from the same part of the brain. Meaning we can only experience one or the other at that moment.

Gratitude becomes a walkway or bridge between the two. When the mind focuses on what you are most grateful for and appreciate most in your life and why the brain starts to release those feel-good chemicals again. Who wouldn’t want to be filled with feelings of love and warmth?

Tony Robbins, world-renowned Peak Performance Coach, shared in an Instagram post today that “gratitude is the antidote to anger – you can’t be grateful and angry at the same time”. He says that when we “view our lives through the lens of gratitude and appreciate we experience a level of freedom and fulfillment like never before”.",
"What is one thing you can do to become a great leader? Find people who will challenge you. If you surround yourself with the best and brightest, and create a safe environment for them to test your thinking, void of career limiting repercussions, you will become a better leader.

It takes an emotionally intelligent leader to forge a work environment where diversity of thought is promoted. These kinds of leaders implicitly understand that their title does not mean they have all the answers, all the time. Rather, they recognize that having a team around them that feels comfortable challenging them will enable better thinking and vastly improve business outcomes.

Whether you're high in emotional intelligence or less so, here are three ideas that you can use to shape your team to challenge you and make you a better leader:

Be deliberate in building a team that provides a variety of perspectives and is rich in diversity of thought.

It is here that backgrounds and life stories can play a big role. One of the things I counsel my clients to do is to ask job candidates about their life stories. A candidate's responses to questions about how they got to where they are can be telling. Seek to add people to your team who have different life narratives and experiences.

Call on people who are not from your inner circle to offer an opinion, and don't be afraid to skip level when seeking fresh perspectives.

I've seen this technique work well at a recent client site. The manager whom I was coaching wanted to breathe some fresh ideas into her product development team. She had heard of an up-and-comer from logistics and asked him to participate in a product development brainstorming session she had scheduled with her team.

He wasn't there 10 minutes before he introduced a design concept that, once implemented, would significantly lower the cost of packaging and shipping. Because he had no formal product design experience but understood package and shipping processes, he could think differently about the product than its designers. Consequently, he could suggest a product design change that saved the company money and one the team would have never identified on its own.

Don't be the leader that inadvertently tells the team that they're tone deaf.

Instead, create a collaborative work environment so that the best ideas can be shared and leveraged. You can do this by acknowledging new ideas when offered by your team and encouraging colleagues to challenge your thinking whenever they believe that a better idea can be had.

There is no doubt that people who can bring fresh ideas and perspectives to your team are very valuable. They can help you see where some of the biggest issues and greatest opportunities exist. Yes, you must seek to hire people who are experts in needed specialties. However, be sure they think differently from you. Once the team is in place, empower them to speak their minds. In this way, you will be building a team that can offer unique insights to problem solving and help you become the best leader you can be.",
"Last week, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, explained why he works 120-hour weeks in an interview with tech journalist Kara Swisher. Swisher asked, ""Why do you push yourself that hard?"" Musk responded: ""Well, the other option would have been, Tesla dies.""

Tesla cannot die, Musk said, because it's important for the future of sustainable energy. ""The fundamental purpose, the fundamental good that Tesla provides is accelerating the advent of sustainable transport and energy production,"" Musk said. ""It's very important for the future of the world.""

This isn't the first time that Musk has referred to an overarching sense of purpose as the principle driver behind his ferocious work ethic. Earlier this year Musk said, ""Life cannot just be about solving one miserable thing after another. That can't be the only thing. There need to be things that inspire you, that make you glad to wake up in the morning and be part of humanity.""

Management book author Marcus Buckingham once conducted a study of thousands of peak performers. He arrived at what he considers the single best definition of leadership: ""Great leaders rally people to a better future,"" he writes in The One Thing You Need to Know.

According to Buckingham, a leader carries a vivid image in his or her head of what a future could be. ""As a leader, you are never satisfied with the present, because in your head you can see a better future, and the friction between 'what is' and 'what could be' burns you, stirs you up, propels you forward. This is leadership.""

The one reason Steve Jobs returned to Apple

In Walter Isaacson's book on Steve Jobs, he wrote about the day Jobs returned to Apple as an advisor in 1996. Jobs was president of Pixar at the time, and went to the company's headquarters to break the news to the Pixar team. Although he would still be involved in Pixar, he wanted them to know that Apple would take a lot of his time. Asked why he wanted to try to save Apple, which was facing severe financial problems, Jobs said: ""The only reason I want to do this is that the world will be a better place with Apple in it.""

Inspiration, by definition, means to be ""imbued with the spirit,"" an almost supernatural drive to accomplish something great. I've rarely met a successful entrepreneur who is driven by money alone. They enjoy the money and the opportunities wealth provides, but they show up to work because they're driven by something bigger. They have to be.

In the interview with Swisher, Musk vividly explained the ""excruciating effort"" it takes to start a company from scratch. ""Making a car company successful is monumentally difficult,"" said Musk. ""There have been many attempts to create a car company and they have all failed... So, as a startup, a car company, it is far more difficult to be successful than if you're an established, entrenched brand. It is absurd that Tesla is alive. Absurd. Absurd!""

It seems clear to me that Musk isn't driven by making money or even by making a better car. His core purpose appears to be doing something to save the planet from environmental catastrophe. Steve Jobs wasn't driven by money or even to make a better computer. He was inspired to create tools to help people unleash their personal creativity.",

"Companies are beginning to utilize their employees’ behavioral data to better understand and improve their sales operations. Microsoft is no exception. Recently, the company went through a reorg that had the potential of dramatically changing the way 20,000-plus salespeople worked across the globe. So before making major changes, the company used people analytics to answer key questions, such as “Are we spending enough time with our most important customers?” and “Are new hires ramping up and collaborating with customers as quickly as expected?” After learning more, the company piloted an individualized email system to encourage desired sales behaviors.

Companies are beginning to utilize their employees’ behavioral data — generally known as people analytics — to better understand and improve their sales operations, with strong results. Microsoft, where we work, is no exception, and B2B sales is one of the areas where we are seeing the most value. Our findings, and the ways we came to them, can be useful to other sales organizations looking to make internal changes of this type or optimize how their salespeople relate to customers.

In mid-2017, we executed a major redesign of our sales organization in response to what our customers needed from us, and to better align our selling approach with cloud services sales model (in this model, customers pay based on usage versus a traditional fixed licensing deal). We knew we needed a fast and effective transition to the new model without dropping the ball with our customers, but the undertaking was daunting and the stakes were high: With a complex sales organization of 20,000-plus salespeople covering large enterprises to small business customer segments, and spanning 100 countries, it was important to see how these changes impacted our customer collaboration and partnerships. We needed to get answers to some of our biggest questions, including:

Our hunt for answers started by using our own Workplace Analytics product to aggregate de-identified calendar and email metadata for thousands of enterprise salespeople. We then combined that with organizational and customer relationship management data to determine how the people selling via the cloud sales model were collaborating with their internal teams, customers, and partners. The next step was to correlate sales outcomes with these behaviors to identify the patterns that correlated with better results. These analyses were done in part to help us through a massive transformation and in part to better align us in responding to our customers’ needs and expectations. To date, the analyses revealed several actionable insights, which we came to with the help of our colleagues Ben Boatman, Chris Moss, Gabriel Zhou, Jared Baker, and Fabio Correa.

1. Networks are vital — and a reorg could destabilize them. One of the first things we learned is that salespeople with larger, more inclusive networks tended to have better outcomes. This is consistent with a number of other similar studies. Based on this finding, we initiated a program to coach our sales teams to focus on efficiently building and growing their internal and external networks. By looking at network size relative to tenure within the company, we were further able to establish that it typically takes roughly 12 months for most people to build these networks.

This underpins the importance of stability in roles over that time period, and beyond. It also left us concerned that the reorganization was forcing the salesforce to rebuild their networks from scratch, which could be costly and sub-optimal for our customers. To mitigate this cost, we rolled out programs to emphasize manager coaching and invested in facilitating rapid network growth for new hires.

2. We engage very differently with high-growth accounts. Another key aspect of the re-org was to ensure continued growth of our business and the right level of engagement with customers. Looking at the amount of time teams spent interacting with each of their accounts, as well as the number of individual contacts they were connecting with, allowed us to identify statistically significant differences in how teams engaged with the different account segments. On average, teams engaged with twice the number of customer contacts in our higher growth accounts, and collaborated double the amount of time with these customers as compared to lower growth accounts.

To make sure this wasn’t just a one-time anomaly, we also confirmed that this pattern was consistent month over month. Correlation vs causation is always an open question with an initial finding like this: are the accounts higher growth because we spend more time with them? Or do we spend more time with them because they are higher growth? Deeper analysis showed that investing more time and energy into partnering with some of these lower growth accounts could improve them. As a result, we adjusted our sales coverage models to enable more face time with these previously underserved customers.

3. Relationship investments correlate with customer satisfaction. It was important that the new sales model also drives happier customers and partners. Therefore, our next step was to look for patterns associated with customer satisfaction. We found that customer satisfaction is directly correlated with customer collaboration time (email and meetings) across all Microsoft roles and teams engaging with customers, including product engineering and marketing teams.

In the enterprise segment specifically, satisfied customers are the ones we spend the most time with and the least satisfied are the ones we barely keep in touch with. This and other findings encouraged our sales leaders to revamp internal business processes such as business reviews and forecasting meetings to be more efficient. We also reduced the number of enterprise accounts per seller to allow for more customer interaction. This enabled our sales teams to spend more time building and maintaining relationships across their entire account portfolios. We also observed behavioral differences in different countries — some use email more frequently than others, for example U.S. and Canada sellers directly schedule meetings with customers through Outlook, while in Japan customer meetings are more formal and scheduled via executive assistants. This confirmed our understanding of various cultural norms and collaboration patterns which was an important input to our analysis.

4. Customer satisfaction (and churn) can be predicted. As part of our ongoing organizational efforts to better understand our customers, one of our teams built a machine learning model that uses more than 100 features to predict customer satisfaction. We worked closely with this team to add the behavioral data about collaboration we gathered into the model. After our analysis, we discovered that collaboration became the top feature in predicting customer satisfaction, and helped increase the accuracy of the model from 78% to 93%.

Being able to predict satisfaction of each of our customers at any given time with this level of accuracy was a groundbreaking discovery for us. Further, having a deeper understanding of how our team’s interactions influence customer satisfaction by segment has huge upsides: it enables us to intervene in time to change high-risk customers into low-risk ones, and to offer new opportunities to highly satisfied customers. Our ability to predict customer satisfaction with this level of accuracy will help us keep an ongoing pulse on our transformation and intervene in a timely manner to ensure customer satisfaction at all times.

What’s next. Our goal is to arm each seller with these four insights on an ongoing basis, setting them up to be as successful as possible in creating value for our customers. We are currently testing a prototype in which a customized and automated email is sent monthly to each seller to help guide them toward behaviors that drive higher outcomes. Importantly, the data sent to each seller is set up for their eyes only; to protect everyone’s privacy and retain trust in the system, no one else, not even upper management, can see anyone else’s data.

Salespeople are provided the following every month:

We believe this information will empower our sellers with nudges and recommendations that are simple, actionable, and effective. Early reactions are extremely positive. If we continue do our jobs well, our sellers will be empowered to be as successful as possible, and will get better and increasingly connected to customers over time.

We also learned a few things along the way that were critical in helping us shape the story and vision to drive business impact.

We’ve invested a lot of time and resources in building out our behavioral data capabilities, and they’re already generating tremendous value. However, we believe we are still in the very early phases of uncovering what’s possible. We have a long way to go, but so far, our transformation is working. Pushing the envelope on behavioral analytics has been a key ingredient to our success, and hopefully our insights can help your salespeople, too.",
"The boss you have early in a career can determine your path of success. Apart from any other factor--including your own skills and ability--whether a boss truly supports you will dictate your entire career, and sets you on a course for what you can achieve.

I know this because I've had two outstanding bosses, and each one helped me advance quickly in my career, often assigning me roles that were far beyond my abilities or experience.

When I first worked at a startup in the 90s, my boss was constantly giving me more to do. He hired me to do page layout work, but I ended up supervising a small marketing team. I started out leading two or three graphics designers, and expanded to around six. Then we started doing product design and quality assurance for a new sign-making system.

It was during this time when I developed a lifelong interest in technology. I remember pouring over specs for every new Mac we purchased. I read Adobe product manuals from cover to cover. At one meeting, my boss told me: ""You know more about technology than anyone I know."" It was an over-statement, most likely. I still believed him.

By the time I started a new role at a consumer electronics company around 1995, I had already helped design a new product, led a team of designers, and written an entire product manual at that first company out of college. The boss at my first real job set me on a path of leadership, and it carried over to the next job. Hired as a technical writer originally, my boss at the new company also recognized my leadership skills and promoted me to a team lead role within a few months, then as a project manager. Eventually, that team grew from only three writers to a few dozen designers, writers, and software testers.

You can see how a theme developed in my career. Each new boss gave me a chance to lead something new, and I responded right away--I accepted the challenge. When I look back, I realize the trajectory could have been far different. One or both of those bosses could have kept me pigeon-holed, ignoring my leadership bent. They could have assigned someone more experienced to those roles. Even though the second job ended in failure (mostly due to an economic downturn after 9/11), it was still a wild ride. And, it led to a long writing career.

Great leaders know how to recognize talent in others. That are masters at placing people into the role they were always meant to have, at finding the best people for the most ideal tasks. They are not afraid to give you more responsibility and assign work that is perhaps more than you can handle, but gives you the opportunity to excel.

A terrible boss doesn't know how to do this. If you are ever stuck in a dead-end job, wondering why you seem so unhappy and don't feel challenged, the first place to look is one level up. Your boss might be holding you back because he or she doesn't want anyone else getting the credit. Or maybe you have a boss who picks favorites or tends to control everything on a team and doesn't want anyone else having any say in how things are done.

A bad boss holds you back in your current job, but more importantly, he or she holds you back in your career. You can't move beyond your current tasks and workload, and it might take years or even decades to figure out where you really belong. That's the truly sad part about a boss that doesn't recognize talent, promote others, or find the best people for a given job. It's a much bigger problem than just getting stuck in one job.

If you're frustrated by a boss that isn't helping you move forward in your career, it might be time to take a risk. Start by having an open conversation with your boss about this or even with the upper management of your company. (Only do this if you are willing to risk losing the job entirely, by the way.) Ask about any additional opportunities. If your boss won't budge, look for a new job where you can thrive under a boss who does set your direction for a career and does have your best interests in mind.",
"There's a reason why many businesses operate within rigid hierarchies. When CEOs set expectations with executives, which are then passed down the chain of command, accountability seems straightforward because it boils down to whether or not an employee followed the directives from their superiors to the letter. Structure-motivated employees may thrive in these environments of cut-and-dry communication, but limitations on self-expression or dialogue can be detrimental to creative teams whose strengths lie in their abilities to question, push boundaries, and create something new.

When you lead a team of creative workers, it's important to communicate through conversation rather than command, balancing your expectations with creatives' needs for respect and trust. If you treat every interaction with a creative employee as an I-command-you-follow moment, you'll see their motivation begin to wane as their tendencies for exploration are stifled and they question your confidence and trust in their abilities. As you're working with creatives to complete projects or solve problems, keep these two approaches in mind.

While employees in analytical roles may appreciate clear-cut commands about the work they should be doing, creatives respond much more positively to questions about what they're up to and how it culminates in a final product. The type of question can make a difference as well. ""Since the due date is this week, where are you in this process?"" leaves more room for conversation than ""Why isn't this done yet?"" If creative employees feel they are approached as humans,  they're more likely to explain their thought processes and pivot to accommodate your expectations as a leader.

Next time you're meeting with a creative team member, open the conversation with a question. Allow that person to walk you through their process, and continue to ask questions that emphasize the purpose of the talk. It might be that the work the employee is doing doesn't match client expectations or that they need to hustle to meet a deadline, but framing your thoughts in the form of a question keeps the dialogue open, which is one of the ways that creatives thrive.

In any leadership position, but particularly one involving creative work, it's important to avoid being too hands-on. If your natural tendency is to jump in with your opinion on every issue or to make changes without discussing the reason behind them, your artistic employees may take your actions to mean that you don't trust or don't approve of them or their work, which is a motivation-killer for anyone.

Instead of inserting yourself into the next project or problem, approach your creative team in conversation first, just as you would knock on someone's door before entering their space. Get their thoughts on the reasoning behind a particular decision or the way they want to approach an issue. One of the strengths of most creative employees is that their brains search for uncommon or unexpected options by instinct, and often they can find solutions that aren't the most obvious, but are the most effective.  If you give your creative employees space to lay out their thoughts, they'll often unveil solutions and perspectives that are more efficient or positively impactful than what you came up with by yourself.

It can be tempting for leaders to operate through a command and control approach, particularly when a tough situation arises, but if you're leading a creative team, space for conversation is critical. Give your creatives breathing room to express their thought processes and push boundaries, and they may catapult the company into new areas of success.",
"In order to stay competitive and remain relevant, retailers must keep an eye on the trends that are shaping the industry. One of the biggest drivers of change is consumer expectations. At the top of the list are convenience, relevancy, value and authenticity.

These drivers are forcing retailers and brands to reshape how they create better experiences to sell products and win customers. As the director of field marketing at Amplience, a cloud-based content management system (CMS) for e-commerce, I am a prime witness of these trends that are shaping the future of this industry. The most successful leaders I have seen have married content and commerce to deliver fast, seamless and personalized shopping experiences that are optimized for mobile.

Based on my observations of the industry, the trends below will shape not only the holiday season but the years to come.

1. Brands will use augmented reality (AR) to allow shoppers to visualize products in their own homes.

Forward-thinking retail brands are incorporating AR technology into the customer experience. This tactic allows consumers to see a detailed view of products from different angles without having to visit a store.

When shopping for furniture, for example, most customers want to touch and feel the fabric before buying. To aid in this process, online furniture retailer Wayfair developed an AR app that places fully rendered 3D models of their furniture in their customers’ homes. By using AR, Wayfair has made it easier for customers to engage with their brand and visualize before buying.

User adoption is still in the early phases, so retailers need to be mindful of user behaviors. Before diving into AR, retailers must think through the pros and cons and have a strategic plan in place. While it is costly to implement AR, it could tremendously improve both the online and in-store shopping experiences for customers.

For years, retailers and consumers alike have been customizing products. What changed is that manufacturing technology has enabled brands to offer customization both online and in-store. By allowing consumers to build and personalize their products, it makes the shopping experience more unique and enjoyable.

There are still so few brands doing product customization. There’s a big opportunity this holiday season to offer up customizable products because it differentiates your products from those of your competitors and often reduces the number of returns.

By leveraging customization, retailers can also charge more for one-off products. It is a win-win situation: happy seller, happy buyer.

3. Seamlessly personalize the shopping experience across all channels.

Personalization can provide a huge boost to revenue. According to The Boston Consulting Group’s 2017 “Profiting from Personalization” report, “Already brands that create personalized experiences by integrating advanced digital technologies and proprietary data for customers are seeing revenue increase by 6% to 10%, according to our research -- two to three times faster than those that don’t.”

New and emerging personalization technology goes beyond just product recommendations. Based on what I have seen, many successful retailers that have implemented this strategy focus on targeted content based on product preferences and past purchases to create a seamless experience across all channels. Other tactics include targeted emails with discounts and offers.

Retailers that use customer data and content to tailor interactions will have a leg up on the competition. I expect to see more of a focus on personalization during this year’s holiday season across beauty, apparel and big-box retailers.

4. Buy online, pick up in store (BOPIS) is increasing.

Shipping strategies are changing. Retailers need to make the buying experience more convenient for the shopper. According to a recent survey of 3,000 online shoppers from Canada, the U.K. and the U.S., nearly half of the total number of respondents still choose to pick up some of their online orders in brick-and-mortar stores. Americans are more likely to be incentivized by saving on shipping costs, especially during the holiday season.

Some retailers have started to pick up this trend and introduce new strategies to get products to their shoppers faster by allowing them to pick up in the store. For example, Macy’s offers free store pickup, and when you select this option, you’ll get a coupon for a discount off your next store purchase.

For brands that want to implement this tactic (or already have), I suggest announcing it in your holiday promotions. Take the stress out of holiday shopping and offer discounts to shoppers that opt-in for BOPIS. No one wants to deal with frantic shoppers or long checkout lines!

Many shoppers are planning on using their mobile devices to search for deals this holiday season while at home or on the go. According to estimates by eMarketer, “In 2017, retail e-commerce sales worldwide reached $2.304 trillion, a 24.8% increase over the previous year.” The mobile share of this stood at 58.9%, or nearly $1.4 trillion.

It’s now more important than ever to create a quality mobile experience for your customers. Websites need to be optimized for mobile. It’s vital to ensure that your content is responsive and the site speed is fast. The risk is shopping cart abandonment and poor conversions.

Consumers are placing a lot more value on convenience and relevancy. Leverage this opportunity by optimizing your e-commerce site across all channels and devices.

With advanced technology and data, I hope you surpass holiday sales forecasts and exceed your customers’ expectations for many years to come.",None
"You pitch in a job interview why you're the best for the position. Why you're capable to fill it. Why you deserve it. There's the infamous 'elevator pitch'. Where you have only 30-60 seconds to get your idea across. Then there's the classic sales pitch. There are many variations of a ""pitch.""

At some point in your life and career. You'll have to pitch. It can be daunting. Yet, an invaluable skill to master. Even if you plan on avoiding any sort of attempt at pitching. Perhaps there'll come a time where you need to hear a pitch. You need to know how to filter the good from the bad.

Pitching was never second nature to me. It does take time to get comfortable with it. It could be due to past traumas. Like that one time, when you got laughed at presenting to your class in school? It could be just being in the spotlight in general. It's an introvert's worst nightmare.

Don't let all that get in your way. I summarized what makes my pitches winners. Here are my 5 P's to pitching perfectly. If I've ticked off all these things then I'm confident enough to get through it.

For others to believe in your idea you need to make sure it's presented well. You need to show that you've put in the time and energy. The hard work needed to get across what you're pitching.

Start by doing the research. Don't cut corners. Whether it's an interview where you're selling yourself or a sales pitch. Do the background work on the employer or investor. It'll help you out in the pitch. You'll come across enthusiastic, capable to answer on-the-spot questions, and prepared.

You need to be comfortable with your pitch. This will only come with practice. And that'll come with time. So take the time to run through it, again, and again.

Pitch to anyone. A diverse group ideally. These people will pick up on different things that need improving. I always find practicing a pitch in front of friends the hardest people to stand in front of. They're the people I have fun with. So being professional and somewhat serious makes me uneasy. But it's important to get out of your comfort zone. Practicing in front of various dynamics gets you more pitching experience.

You want your demonstration to be flawless. The audience you're pitching to will have been through hundreds of these-- probably more. They'll see your dedication.

In a pitch, you're not just promoting the idea. You're promoting yourself. Your product or service, for example, could potentially be the best on the market. However, pitches mean more than a sale. They mean partnerships.

If you're not promoting yourself in the right way. It could comprise the pitch. Future investors know it'll be less work for them if you show you're the real deal.

My advice would be to perfect your style. Pitching doesn't come with a structure. You can be flexible with it. Then adapt according to your audience.

In my experience. Connecting with the audience on a human level has always been the lasting effect. Rather than a list of figures. Never underestimate the act of giving someone goosebumps. You never know, they might never forget it.

You don't want to turn up to any sort of pitch with a powerpoint of jam-packed information. Powerpoints are fine to use. Just think visually creative. You want your pitch to be interactive. You're telling a story through relevant content. Make sure it flows. The tool Prezi is great for this. You need to show clear, concise facts and figures to back up your points.

If it's a pitch where you have no visual aid then focus on your delivery. It still needs to flow. I find it best to make it more like a conversation. Make key points. Let the audience ask the questions for you to expand on. This will avoid you turning a pitch into a speech. It'll also prevent you from overloading on information they might miss.",
"Wall Street’s most important problem isn’t America’s trade war with China. It’s political uncertainty combined with the end of easy money.

The end of the year is usually a good time for Wall Street. Investors are in a party state of mind, which creates a “buy-buy” mentality and sends major market averages northward.

Investors seem to have skipped the holiday season parties. Instead, they are in a sell-sell mentality, sending major market averages south.

The problem? Trade war between the US and China, and the threat of de-globalization.

That’s a reversal of a four decade old trend in the direction of opening up cross-border trade to competition -- and the profit opportunities it generates for corporations—some listed on Wall Street.

While the trade war between the world’s two largest economies is clear and eminent, it’s premature to worry about de-globalization, however. Sooner or later, Washington will settle trade disputes with China, the same way it settled similar disputes with Mexico and Canada.

And when that happens, globalization will resume its course, bringing relief to Wall Street.

But there’s another, more important problem than the trade war, and it is oneWall Street cannot solve: growing political uncertainty, combined with the drying up of liquidity.

“The trade war with China will one day end,” says Christopher Bates, a former Member of the NYSE. “Yet the political standoff may last two years until the presidential and congressional elections in 2020, creating a stagnant economy.“

Then there’s rising of interest rates, which are drying up liquidity on Wall Street and  Main Street, and could turn economic stagnation into an outright recession.

It’s well known what happens to Wall Street and Main Street when a recession is imminent. Recession hits particularly hard “highly cyclical” industries like automobiles and high technology. Layoffs come back to haunt workers, and financial losses come back to haunt investors.

“The good feeling on the US economic outlook has begun to trend downward,” adds Bates. “GM’s announcement to cut its workforce and close several plants is another signal of a slowdown and trouble ahead. Tech stocks have already been hard hit recently in the past two months as investors have taken profits and rotated into other sectors.”

To be fair, most US economic indicators have been pointing to a strong economy. Like growing payrolls and falling unemployment, as reported recently by the Labor Department.

But these are lagging indicators. They tell the past. Wall Street is a leading indicator. It tells the future.

And that future doesn’t look good, according to Bates.",
"Peer-to-peer learning can be a powerful development tool that breaks through some common barriers to skill-building—and it taps into the expertise that already exists in your organization. People learn new skills best in any situation that includes all four stages of what we call the “Learning Loop”: gain knowledge; practice by applying that knowledge; get feedback; and reflect on what has been learned. Peer-to-peer learning encompasses all of these. To set up a peer-to-peer learning program for your team, focus on building a safe environment where they will be open to constructive feedback, and focus on real-world situations so participants can apply the skills they’ve learned quickly.

When your team wants to learn a new skill, where do they turn first? Google? YouTube? Their corporate training programs? No. According to a conducted by our company, Degreed, more workers first turn to their peers (55%)—second only to asking their bosses. Peer-to-peer learning can be a powerful development tool that breaks through some common barriers to skill-building — and it has other benefits as well.

Yet many organizations have yet to create a formal structure for peer-to-peer learning. In a McKinsey , Learning & Development officers report that while classroom training, experiential learning, and on-the-job application of skills are now in regular use as learning mechanisms, less than half of organizations have instituted any kind of formal peer-to-peer learning. One in three respondents said their organizations don’t even have any systems in place to share learning among employees.

In the research for our book , we found that managers are often reluctant to establish formal peer-to-peer learning primarily because of a perception that experts outside the company are more valuable as teachers than those inside it, and because peer-to-peer programs are spaced out over numerous sessions. In this context, sending employees to a single day of intense training from an outside expert is assumed to be more fruitful.

It isn’t. First, peer-to-peer learning taps into the expertise that already exists in your organization. Think of all the smart people that you hire and surround yourself with every day, and how much could be gained if peers shared their expertise with each other to learn and build new skills.

Peer-to-peer learning is also uniquely well suited to the way we learn. People gain new skills best in any situation that includes all four stages of what we call the “Learning Loop”: gain knowledge; practice by applying that knowledge; get feedback; and reflect on what has been learned. Peer-to-peer learning encompasses all of these.

For example, when Kelly was in charge of learning at LinkedIn, her team created a peer-to-peer learning program designed around the company’s key corporate values. One section of the program focused on difficult conversations; each participant was asked to identify a real-life difficult conversation they needed to have at work (especially one they might be avoiding). They were first taught about difficult conversations (stage 1); next they practiced with each other before holding the conversations in real life (stage 2). One of the participants, John, confronted his employee Mark about his missed deadlines, a pattern which had been negatively affecting the team. The conversation did not go well — John felt awkward, and Mark got defensive. When John shared this experience with his peers in the learning group, they openly shared their views and ideas, and their own experiences of similar situations (stage 3). As everyone in the group — not just John — reflected on what they had learned, they concluded that they had all become more confident and armed with ideas about how to better handle a similar situation in the future (stage 4). Later group members indicated that their real-world difficult conversations indeed had become more productive.

A learner’s development is dependent on a willingness to make mistakes, challenge ideas, and speak up about concerns — as John and his colleagues did in their group. Unlike some learning methods — like tests or exams, or high-pressure demonstrations of skills — peer-to-peer learning creates a space where the learner can feel safe taking these risks without a sense that their boss is evaluating their performance while they are learning. You’re more likely to have candid conversations about areas you need to develop with a peer than with someone who has power over your career and income. In peer-to-peer learning, the dynamics of hierarchy disappear. And unlike other methods — like classroom lectures or online compliance training — peer-to-peer learning provides a structured opportunity to have these discussions to begin with.

A secondary benefit of peer-to-peer learning is that the format itself helps employees develop management and leadership skills. Group reflection conversations help employees master the difficult skills of giving and accepting honest, constructive feedback. Because feedback flows in both directions, participants in peer-to-peer learning tend to put more time and energy into making sure the feedback they provide is meaningful. They think from the perspective of their peer, consider where each is coming from, and try to get specific about what will be most helpful and constructive. This doesn’t happen as often when a boss delivers one-way feedback to employees. Similarly, peer learning gives employees experience in leadership, handling different points of view, and developing skills such as empathy.

Formal peer-to-peer learning programs can take many forms. As a manager, you can hold your program online or in person. Your program could pair participants in one-to-one sessions, create cohorts working together on real work problems over a few months, or involve weekly sessions in which individuals share the latest knowledge they’ve gained with their peers with plenty of time for discussion and reflection.

To make any peer-to-peer learning program successful for your team, we recommend a few best practices:

Appoint a facilitator. Although the structure of peer learning is horizontal rather than hierarchical, it’s important to have a neutral party who is not the team’s manager facilitate the program to keep in on track. This person — ideally a skilled facilitator — should organize sessions, keep everyone on topic, keep conversations moving forward, and maintain a positive atmosphere for participants to learn, experiment, and ask questions.

Build a safe environment. Peer learning only works when participants feel safe enough to share their thoughts, experiences, and questions. They need to be open and vulnerable enough to accept constructive input, and also have the courage to give honest feedback rather than telling people what they want to hear.

To build a safe environment, set ground rules. Some suggestions: confidentiality must be honored; feedback should be perceived as a generous gesture that should always be met with gratitude; participants should practice empathy, putting themselves in others’ shoes; and participants should never be mocked or embarrassed for expressing themselves in front of their peers.

Focus on real-world situations. Whenever possible, these sessions should focus on genuine problems to solve. People are more likely to participate, learn, and remember new skills if they are learned in the course of addressing a real-life challenge.

Encourage networking. It helps to set up online social networks around learning, organize networking events for people to discuss their area of expertise, and establish learning groups that meet regularly to discuss ideas. Some organizations build company-wide campaigns in an effort to get everyone involved.

With a well-built peer-to-peer learning program in place as a complement to more traditional learning programs, your team will build lasting skills and relationships that will allow them to bring the skills they learn in those programs into their daily work.",
"Many would argue that the enthusiasm for blockchain and cryptocurrency is waning. Indeed, according to Gartner’s hype cycle, blockchain is tumbling into the trough of disillusionment where the fleet of Lamborghini’s belonging to early crypto speculators have all but run out of fuel as cryptocurrency prices stabilize and regulators tighten their scrutiny of security-issues masking as initial coin offerings (ICOs) or newfangled ways of getting rich quick. If peak crypto is behind us and the blockchain bubble has burst, where does the promise of this world-changing technology go from here? Time to pack it up or time to reformulate how we think about this technology and the implied digital transformation it necessitates? Will blockchain go the way of early electric car prototypes only to lay dormant for 40 years before a Tesla comes along? Will cloud-based spreadsheets masquerading as blockchains temper enthusiasm for the value of technology investments? Many questions remain, but one thing is certain, fully harnessing blockchain has less to do with technology and more to do with advances in management thought and the art of the possible.

The argument that the blockchain bubble has burst made vociferously by the likes of Nouriel Roubini in a Senate hearing, misses a couple of key points. The first and foremost being that the technology has only come out of beta in 2017, despite bitcoin and its underlying public blockchain turning 10 this year. Since, in addition to the pilot projects being carried out by the 50 largest companies in the world (with some industries opting for “coopetition”), there is a growing cadre of blockchain-based projects gaining serious global recognition for their potential to change the fundamental nature for how economies and essential services are organized. Unlike the internet, which is a disruptive technology borrowing from Clayton Christensen’s thinking on disruptive innovation, blockchain is very much an augmenting technology. For this power to be unlocked, however, companies, entrepreneurs, technologists and policymakers need to do the unthinkable – relinquish control. This much is demanded by the market and the constituent parts of the global economy that have been telling us one thing in increasingly louder voices, they do not trust status quo or the traditional centralized structures that gain the most from it.

Implied in decentralized and distributed systems, where each node or participant operates pari passu or on equal footing, is that no on counterparty has control or more authority than another. This is a difficult and perhaps impossible level of abstraction in our current economic order, where an embarrassment of riches and power has been amassed by centralized structures, technologies and control. Indeed, the reason the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC, is favorable toward bitcoin is precisely because of its decentralization. Is there a realm in which firms deploying blockchain can create a new category of service or solution where control, trust and value become evenly distributed? Why not! In order to get there, however, the change is not singularly about digital transformation for which blockchain cannot operate in a vacuum of other frontier technologies, it has more to do with the evolution of management thinking and organizational design. The matrix below provides a useful guide for how this transformational journey begins and where it should end in a proverbial blockchain “magic quadrant,” provided project sponsors wish to fully leverage a high-trust, low-friction platform.

Against this methodology, it is difficult to identify another true blockchain project other than bitcoin, that category defying digital asset, that meets these criteria in balance. Even the crypto wunderkind Vitalik Buterin’s cryptocurrency, ether, began life as a semi-centralized instrument. What does this say about the current state of play and the projects, ICOs and other supposedly world-changing applications of this technology, from digital identity, payments, supply chain provenance, even e-voting, are they blockchains at all? Or is the rate of innovation and tinkering taking place with this new technology just now getting serious, hence the accelerated appearance and demise of projects? Blockchain, like the early days of the internet, is in its thousand flowers blooming phase. The market picks winners, technologists are merely the gardeners. Some may be disappointed to learn that the path to becoming a blockchain billionaire may be harder than the one charted by the internet tech titans before them, in no small measure because of the span of control issues posed by true blockchain projects.

Much like the advent of cloud computing or the flight of imagination needed for an untethered internet, the shift to digital transformation using blockchain is more about management culture and leadership than it is about technology or informational architecture. In many ways, the technology is the easy part. The hard part is the suspension of disbelief and long-held norms about organizational approaches to trust, transparency, intermediation control and value capture, which all conspire to form the high-friction market we currently operate in. The outcomes in this low-trust, high-friction analog world leave a lot to be expected. Billions of people are left on the sidelines without a universally portable and secure personal identity.  Millions of votes are uncast, uncounted or disputed because there is no scalable high-fidelity way of addressing micro-counting and election security. Trillions in stranded assets and complex global threats are on the margins of being economically viable because current distribution, pricing and service structures make market entry unpalatable and uncompetitive. Blockchain as a technology can abundantly address these gaps. The scarcest resource appears to be the lack of imagination and will from entrenched power structures that gain the most from status quo.

Progress with blockchain, even for large incumbent companies or power structures, need not be a zero-sum proposition. Indeed, blockchain is an augmenting technology precisely because it does not have to disrupt the type of value derived from existing systems, rather it can help create entirely new service, product and relationship models with and between markets or constituents. As an example, imagine the evolution of insurance distribution from the agent and broker-based distribution model that was borne from the analog days, to the advent of models like Geico direct courtesy of the internet, to something more akin to a customer mutual where dividends, losses and trust are managed in lockstep for a market or risk-sharing pool. Similarly, in California’s move to solar-enable its housing stock by 2020, the advent of blockchain-based microgrids can ensure that older homes can buy excess energy in economical ways producing a more resilient energy matrix. Absent blockchain and management acceptance of distributed systems, which can record trust with the fidelity and permanence as an atomic clock records time, this new class of market offering would not be possible, and the assets stranded on the sidelines of the market by stubborn friction and sclerotic structures would not be activated. The question is not whether to blockchain or not to blockchain, the real question is how.",None
"""Passion is energy.  Feel the power that comes from focusing on what excites you.” —Oprah Winfrey

“The purpose of life is not to be happy.  It is to be useful, to be honorable, to be compassionate, and to have it make some difference that you have lived and lived well.” —Ralph Waldo Emerson

A few weeks ago when I wrote about The Four Ps of Leadership (Purpose, Plan, People, Power), I heard from a number of people that I should have included passion or better yet, have substituted passion for purpose as the first P. (I also heard that I should have included patience and persistence, but that’s another story.)  More recently, I attended an American Express Leadership Academy in London where participants-emerging, high potential leaders from charitable organizations in the U.K.-were asked to rank themselves on a passion-to-purpose continuum. Many were unsure where they fit.

Philosophers and poets (and consultants) have debated the tension between purpose and passion for years. Some have argued that passion is about your emotions while purpose is the reason behind those emotions. Or, that passion is about the “what” (I’m passionate about ___”) and purpose is about the “why” (“I am here to accomplish___”). Or, that passion is about yourself while purpose is about others. Or, that passion is the result of doing meaningful work, not the reason for doing that work.

Aristotle spoke of the “function of man” as being a rational animal linked to reason and language as distinguishing characteristic of humans. He only considered passion in terms of pleasure and pain. Socrates believed that passion imprisoned the soul to the body. And, Plato believed that the dispassionate, rather than the passionate, self should be our goal as humans. When passion does enter the picture, Plato argues that it requires mastery and discipline to control it.

While there is no single, unified tradition for Eastern philosophies, many religious leaders speak of the ""meaning of life"" being self-awareness, enlightenment and consciousness rather than rational or worldly pursuits. In Buddhism, cravings or desires are thought to be the cause of suffering so they should be avoided.

In our society, how often have you heard someone say, “Follow your passion!” rather than “Find your purpose!”? Passion is often seen as an antidote to seemingly boring careers or something that every person needs in order to be happy in their work. But, the truth is that not everyone has a true passion, and the ability to pursue it as a vocation. In fact, following one’s passion may be a dangerous career choice because passions can come and go while purpose is (hopefully) more permanent.

There's a story about someone asking Eleanor Roosevelt about her “passionate interest” in a piece of proposed social legislation. ""Yes,"" she did support the cause she said. “But, I hardly think the word ‘passionate’ applies to me.”  Indeed, like Plato, some writers have argued that the best leaders are dispassionate about their causes. A contrary opinion was expressed by American philosopher Thomas Nagle who believed that human flourishing involves the well-functioning of all of our essential capabilities-both subjective and objective.

Whatever your point of view, leaders need a guiding direction. If that direction is the result of a true passion in life, and that passion can translate into worthwhile action, then all the better. But, if that direction comes from a dispassionate view that things can be better with a different approach, the resulting purpose can be a lasting noble pursuit.

Either way, leaders need to recognize where they fall on the passion-to-purpose spectrum in order to effectively marshal the resources (and energy) to chart their own paths.  As a leader, I tend toward the purpose end of the continuum, but there are many truly inspiring leaders who are driven by passion first.",
"Let’s face it: As humans, we want to be liked. This desire drives people to avoid conflict. In many organizations, avoiding conflict has become the art and science of self-preservation. We’re always looking for ways to avoid or put off difficult conversations. This is particularly true when it comes to providing feedback on performance.

Giving and receiving feedback is part of the job for most of us; however, for many, it is not a process they are comfortable with. Finding the right approach and environment for delivering and discussing feedback – whether positive or negative, upward or downward, anonymous or open – often brings stress for both the reviewer and the reviewee. While we want our feedback to be constructive and useful to the recipient, the circumstances and parties involved can ultimately influence whether feedback comes off as supportive or judgmental.

Yet, if we are to be effective managers and team members, we owe it to ourselves and our colleagues to provide direct, constructive, and regular feedback that elevates individual and organizational performance. That requires us to disassociate the act of providing feedback with the negative connotation of “conflict.” This starts with exhibiting behaviors that foster trust and respect.

Turning the feedback process into an activity that is a positive experience and a stepping stone to a more productive professional relationship begins with these three simple principles. While these ideas are not new, they are easy to overlook.

Most organizations have an annual review process that ties feedback to salary increases, bonuses, and promotions. Certainly, the documentation (forms that compare results to stated goals) and discussion that are part of the process are important. But the most effective feedback is ongoing - not an “event,” but rather a continuous discussion of performance expectations and outcomes. The feedback loop should be part of the everyday, not separate from it.

Furthermore, people should not hear about performance issues for the first time during a formal annual review. The sooner you can work with someone to provide direct, real-time feedback to curb behaviors that detract from individual and/or organizational success, the more quickly that person can adjust in advance of documenting said performance - and the more genuine you will appear in your effort to guide that improvement.

Anonymous channels, such as a 360-degree feedback tool that encourages everyone in a person’s sphere of work to share their views, are a formal part of performance management at many organizations. These tools can serve specific and limited purposes. Anonymous feedback provides an opportunity for anyone interested to weigh-in on a person’s performance, expanding the number of data points for assessing performance from a multitude of perspectives.

Keep in mind that anonymous feedback is a one-way communication channel with no opportunity to clarify or engage in discussion, which can lead to misinterpretation. Further, it might embolden stronger and more prejudiced responses because they cannot be traced back to the reviewer.

Anonymous feedback is an easy way to avoid conflict. However, dialogue can make the difference between someone listening to feedback and actually “hearing” and trusting the message. An in-person conversation makes it more likely the feedback will stick.

Whether you are providing feedback in person, in writing, or through an anonymous channel, make sure feedback is clear and actionable.

Consider these examples of feedback provided through anonymous feedback mechanisms:

If you received feedback like this, how would you react? You’re probably more likely to be upset and defensive than motivated to do something differently.

If you have concerns that someone doesn’t embody the character of the organization or shows favoritism, give examples of what that means and suggest actions that could help reverse that perception - whether true or not. Doing so keeps the process on a professional rather than personal level and builds trust rather than anger.

""He is too bossy and not a team player"" becomes, ""He doesn’t practice active listening with his team, and the team would feel more collaborative if he allowed us to speak and provide our perspectives.""

Furthermore, not only should we all commit to making sure our own feedback is constructive, but we need to teach and encourage others to do the same.

If embraced in a constructive and helpful way, the feedback process does not have to feel like going into battle - it can become a positive experience that improves relationships, performance, and outcomes consistent with an employee’s professional growth plan.

By keeping these three principles top-of-mind when preparing to offer feedback, we can begin to make the process feel more open, honest, and most importantly, safe - which, in turn, will alleviate some of the stress and tendency toward avoidance.

"President Donald Trump shows hostility towards any person or news organization that paints an unfavorable picture of him, including women. Despite insults, they press on.  The latest examples of mistreatment include three female White House correspondents. Last week, Trump called American Urban Radio Networks’ April Ryan a “loser” and told her to sit down, commented that CNN’s Abby Phillip’s question was “stupid” and accused PBS NewsHour’s Yamiche Alcindor of asking a “racist question.”

The president has mocked ABC News’s Cecilia Vega’s intelligence, called CBS News Weijia Jiang “obnoxious” and ignored a question from a female reporter for the U.K.’s Sky News. The White House retaliated against CNN’s Kaitlin Collins, banning her from a Rose Garden event after she asked a question the administration thought was “inappropriate.”

Inexcusably, women continue to be derided in the workplace. The visibility of women journalists in the Trump era provides others the opportunity to see how to push through hostility. Here’s how these female reporters continue to do their job and how you can, too:

1. Stay standing, and ask the hard questions.

These women journalists are asking tough questions of the president. People want Trump to comment on voter suppression, white nationalism, the appointment of the acting attorney general, then Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Trump’s former personal attorney Michael Cohen. Not wanting to discuss these potential embarrassing issues, the president was hostile towards the female reporters.

Jobs that seek the truth and accountability are difficult. It is a journalist’s job to obtain and distribute information. It is their job to ask questions, and people are noticing.

Remember your mission, and carry out your role. Your role in life isn’t always going to be easy. Some are going to see you as the “good guy,” and others are going to see you as the “bad guy.” Don’t play to an audience. If you play to an audience, you undermine your credibility and authority. Focus on the job at hand, and demonstrate your leadership. People will take notice.

2. Recognize and reflect on the situation.

Female reporters are talking about how they are being treated at White House press conferences and gaggles. April Ryan recounts the incident on ABC’s The View and wrote an opinion piece for The Washington Post calling out the president’s “verbal attacks on women of color.” Kaitlin Collins spoke on-air about being banned. In discussing their stories, people are learning more about these women journalists and becoming familiar with their work.

You will encounter mistreatment in your career. Don’t feel like you have to keep it to yourself. Talk to people about what you have been through. Tell your story. Share your experience.

Reporters are supporting each other and their work and amplifying the profiles of women journalists. On Twitter, PBS Anchor Judy Woodruff and Washington Post White House Bureau Chief Philip Rucker defended Yamiche Alcindor. Rucker said she “asked a fair and important question about whether Trump’s embrace of the ‘nationalist’ label is an embrace of ‘white nationalism.'” Woodruff highlighted Alcindor’s professionalism and fairness. Many other journalists have spoken out in support of women reporters.

News organizations are also supporting their employees. CNN came out with a statement defending Abby Philip, saying that her question about special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia probe after the appointment of an acting attorney general was “the most pertinent question of the day” and not a “stupid question.”

Journalists and news outlets are protecting the principles of journalism. Protect your mission, and recognize the importance of each other’s work. Support each other through challenges, and claim your role.

April Ryan. Yamiche Alcindor. Abby Phillips. Weijia Jiang. Cecilia Vega. Kaitlin Collins. Until recently, you may not have known the names of these female journalists. Now you know their names and their power. Don’t let mistreatment undermine your power. Persist, reflect and support each other. Press on.

"It shouldn't surprise you that some of the top entrepreneurs in the U.S. are military veterans. As the daughter of an Air Force veteran, I heard about hard-earned leadership skills every day growing up. I've spoken to plenty of other veterans--many of whom have become CEOs. No matter the advice they give, it often has the same theme: Build strong teams.

Before I dive in to the best advice on building teams, I'd like to thank my Dad, our men and women in military service, and the military spouses who support them. For veterans and military spouses looking to start or grow a business, check out these resources from the National Association of Veteran-Serving Organizations, veteran entrepreneur network Bunker Labs, and the resources we keep within our company at  Alice.

1. Focus on the way you treat your employees.

Think about what behavior motivates you and gives you a feeling of being fulfilled and use that same leadership with your own employees. I am most motivated by being around our customers. When I have been in the office too long, I very quickly go hang out and learn the needs of entrepreneurs and am inspired within minutes.

2. Don't request anything you wouldn't be able to do yourself.

""Be part of your own team. My team has to tell me what they've done in the last 90 days that was impactful, and what value they hope to bring to the organization over the next 90 days. I then have to turn around and tell them the same thing.""--Phyllis Newhouse, CEO, Xtreme Solutions

Phyllis Newhouse, the CEO of Xtreme Solutions and retired Army non-commissioned officer (and service-disabled veteran) shared this about her team. She's clear that she would not ask her team to do something she is not willing to do herself--nor should any of us as leaders.

When going through our first round of funding at HelloAlice.com, we celebrated the wins. I was also open about my disappointment through every ""no."" It took the mystery out of our financing and showed a transparency and openness to failure. These days, we share our wins and failures as a team every Friday morning.

3. Take the time to explain objectives and the big picture.

""In the Navy I used to assume people would do what you say because of rank and hierarchy. I quickly learned that if you take the time to explain the bigger picture and purpose of an objective it helps motivate individuals to go above and beyond. Now even in the very fast pace world of technology, I believe you have to go slow to go fast."" --Mike Rosenbaum, EVP of Product, Salesforce

Mike Rosenbaum is quick to be transparent about what he quickly learned as a Lieutenant in the Navy. A graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy and having served in the Submarine USS Nevada Gold, he was clear that rank and leadership are two different things. He has carried over a management style to ensure everyone understands how they fit into the big picture.

In your business, even if you are moving at top speeds, take the time to sit with employees and answer questions of how they contribute to your large goals. I have made the mistake to assume individuals understand where we are heading. We now come together in all staff quarter reviews to ensure we are heading together towards a common vision.

The older I get, the more I value loyalty as much as productivity. People generally aren't loyal to companies--they're loyal to their teammates. Like the Marines, you need to establish a culture of hard work from the beginning. Your team wants to help each other as much, if not more than, the boss.",
"A few years ago, I set out to create a new mindfulness habit: going to yoga once a week. In the first class, I nervously put down my mat in the back, hoping no one would notice how inflexible I was. I felt awkward and extremely self-conscious. During the practice, my mind swirled judgemental thoughts and non-stop comparisons to the other, more advanced students around me.

During one very difficult class, the instructor said something that transformed how I approached the practice. She said, ""Showing up is the hardest part. Your job is to keep coming back to the mat and starting fresh each time.""

These words sum up mindfulness concept known as Beginner's Mind, which refers to approaching situations with an attitude of openness and curiosity. It's based on a Zen teaching that explains, ""In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities, in the expert's mind there are few.""

Whether you're trying to tackle a challenging assignment, push the limits of your creativity, or otherwise advance your career, Beginner's Mind can help you approach your work with fresh eyes and levelheadedness.



Most of us go through life trapped within assumptions and expectations. A fixation on how things ""should be"" or ""must be"" keeps your thinking close-minded and our behavior from being open to change. Beginner's mind, on the other hand, helps you continuously grow:

Novelty sparks learning, so seeking out interesting experiences is a great way to engage your Beginner's Mind. Give yourself at least 20 hours to try out any new habit. Research suggests this enough time to learn something new without it being overwhelming.

I have my coaching clients design their own 30-day challenges. During a sprint, they test pilot new habits, learn new skills, or even experiment with new career paths. This approach helps them get more comfortable with risk, uncertainty, and ambiguity.

Don't worry about having the future perfectly planned out. With a beginner's mindset, you always have a choice to start fresh. If you're getting caught up in ""should's"", try asking yourself ""what would this look like if it were easy?"" or ""how could I make this fun?""

As you pursue new habits, risks, and possibilities, you may face the voice of your inner critic. Stopping these thoughts isn't effective. Deal with them by picturing your thoughts as clouds. Notice them, but let them come and go non-judgmentally like the weather.

Asking questions is at the heart of beginner's mind. Boost your odds at achieving success by honing your skills at self-inquiry. Beginners aren't afraid to ask for help so seek out the advice of mentors or join a community where you feel safe speaking up.",
"""Humility is a core quality of leaders who inspire close teamwork, rapid learning, and high performance in their teams, according to several studies in the past three years,"" writes Sue Shellenbarger in her column for The Wall Street Journal. ""Humble people tend to be aware of their own weaknesses, eager to improve themselves, appreciative of others' strengths, and focused on goals beyond their own self-interest.""

If you think humility is a sign of weakness, please realize that being humble doesn't mean that you lack self-confidence or that you never stand up for your own opinions or principles. Quite the opposite: Humble people must be very strong and secure with themselves. In contrast, insecure people are constantly striving to make themselves look better than others.

Arrogant people rarely listen. They like to be the ones talking, and if they let others speak, they're usually already thinking about what they want to say next.

In contrast, humble people listen carefully when others are speaking. They resist the urge to interrupt and solve; instead, they pay rapt attention and empathetically strive to relate to the other person's point of view. At the right time, they ask tactful questions--not with the goal to judge, but rather to understand.

Humble bosses don't ask someone to do anything they wouldn't do themselves or haven't done themselves. And when a member of their team needs help, a humble boss is ready to roll up their sleeves and join in the dirty work.

Humble people, on the other hand, recognize the accomplishments of others and help them feel appreciated. Additionally, humble people realize that if you praise others when they do well, they'll strive to do more of the same.

But humble people know that most criticism is rooted in truth. And even if not, they recognize that at the very least an alternative perspective gives them a window into another person's thinking. Rather than avoid negative feedback, they actually ask for it--and use it to help them grow.

6. They put the team first.

7. They help their people grow.

Great managers are invested in their people. Instead of holding them back for personal gain, they support them and help them reach their goals. This long-sighted perspective helps them build bridges and opens up opportunities wherever they go.

8. They ask for help.

But humble people recognize that they can't do everything on their own. By willingly asking for help, they benefit from the strengths and experience of others, help them feel useful, and inspire others to ask for help when they need it--leading to a win-win situation.

9. They keep their word.",
"Thriving employees are the backbone of every business, big or small. Employers have become increasingly invested in the health of their workers, and with good reason. The more conscientious and comprehensive the office design and employee health policy, the more your business outperforms those who don't subscribe to employee well-being standards.

Sure, a common perk for the last decade or more has been an on-site gym or supplementing gym memberships, but employers can do more. According to the WELL Building Standard, employees who move throughout the day are healthier than those who don't. Sitting burns 50 fewer calories per hour than standing. Longer term studies are showing people who sit for more than 3 hours per day have a lower life expectancy.

At Microsoft, they know a good exercise incentive when they see one. Or several. Not only do they offer to fund gym memberships or fitness related purchases, they have free on-site Zumba classes, walking and running tracks on campus, and courts for pick-up basketball and volleyball games.

The solutions are not that difficult to implement. Aside from allowing employees to take breaks as necessary to get up for a short walk, employers can invest in sit-stand desks. The beauty of these is employees are still actively working while getting in some much needed movement. If you want to take it to the next level, consider a treadmill desk, a bike desk, or even an under-the-desk elliptical machine for employees who want to exert more energy throughout the day.

Another way to encourage movement is to carefully consider the placement of staircases. If the stairs are easier and faster to take, workers will use them. Beautiful staircases can really open up office space to natural light, serve as a meeting ground for company announcements, and double as an area for people to congregate for those exciting, collaborative discussions that make your business hum. The added benefit is reducing the use of the elevators and getting your employees' blood pumping.

If you're in the market for new office space, consider its proximity to public transportation. Google headquarters in Mountain View, California offers their employees free shuttle transportation every day, eliminating the stress and cost of a long commute and helping the environment. Being only a block or two away from a busy transportation hub can not only save money and the environment, it can give your employees a reason to walk the rest of the way to work.

Let The Outdoors In

We all need sunshine to keep up our Vitamin D, and being stuck in a dark office is no one's idea of fun. Positive effects of natural light in the office are innumerable, including visual comfort, supporting a better sleep cycle, minimizing headaches, and more. Overstock.com headquarters in Salt Lake City, Utah is a prime example of this. Overlooking the panoramic Salt Lake Valley, the company's CEO wanted employees to remain connected with the view while working. So the company installed 30,000 square feet of smart windows, which adjust automatically to optimize natural light while shielding glare from employee computers. Subsequently, employee productivity went up by 2%, which translated to an annual savings of $2 million.

Just as importantly, natural lighting improves the mood of employees, who feel less closed in and trapped as they go about their day. By placing enclosed offices and meeting rooms in the middle of the office space, and spreading the employee workstations around the perimeter in proximity to the windows, you're giving a higher percentage of your employees access to natural light with minimal effort on your part. Situate computer monitors perpendicular to windows and ensure your overhead lighting doesn't shine directly at computer screens to minimize glare. Carefully consider window treatments that will allow the light through but reduces solar glare.

Plants and greenery is another way to promote the health of your employees. Not only do plants improve the air quality, they add texture and interest to the overall design of an office. Green is the color of growth and renewal, and can drastically improve the mood of your employees. Biologically, humans react

Offices have had a long-standing relationship with food vendors for as long as most office workers can remember. If your company has in-house eateries, go over the menu with an eye for reducing the foods that make us unhealthy: processed foods, industrialized oils, and junk food. Check portion sizes. Perhaps offering the choice of half-sized entrees can save on waste, save your employees money, and help employees maintain healthier weights overall.

Asana does all this and does it well. They have an in-house culinary team to provide three meals a day plus snacks to their employees, and their offerings are all organic, as locally procured as possible, and always sustainably farmed and fished. The reason? Good food is a better source of energy than junk.

If you don't have a local farmer's co-op to join, leave the candy out of the vending machine. Vending technology has improved tremendously, so keeping fruit and vegetables instead of candy and chips is an option. Providing more water and tea and fewer sodas and sugary juices is another way to keep calories down.

Curating a healthy environment isn't just about how the office looks and feels, or how many plants are in a room. Having a comprehensive sick leave policy that encourages workers to use it when they need it can go a long way in reducing employee stress and the spread of illnesses. Ensure your healthcare coverage is top notch, and when employees exercise their benefits, support them in whatever ways are necessary. That way, when they're healthy, they're enthusiastic about coming back to work.",
"The word ""stress"" doesn't figure in the successful entrepreneur's instruction manual. If you're going in, you go all in -- or you go home.

A large study published last month looking at the brains of over two thousand healthy young to middle-aged men and women, found an association between having high circulating levels of the stress hormone cortisol and brain thinning.

This isn't the first study to link stress to brain ""shrinkage.""A 2017 study from Sweden found brain thinning associated with chronic work stress could be reversed by giving stressed workers a respite from work and cognitive therapy.

Why has stress suddenly become so toxic?

One possible reason is lifestyles in the past used to include ""stress buffers"" that helped us recover from bouts of stress over the course of the day.

Many of these buffers have disappeared as our lifestyles have changed -- as a result there's a delay in how quickly we're able to shut down a stress reaction once it has begun. This means we spend more time being stressed than we used to.

Before the tech age and sedentary jobs, our days would include frequent, low-intensity movement. Today, many of us move very little during day and finish off the day with a session of high intensity exercise.

Melatonin, the hormone we release when it gets dark at night, can act as an anxiety-reliever. Our overnight dose of darkness used to be a natural nocturnal stress antidote before we started using blue-light-emitting screens late into our evenings: blue light and bright light hinder melatonin production.

Instant communication has resulted in constant demands on our attention. These demands force us to stay vigilant so the brain can't relax after a stressful experience. Being on edge also makes us more prone to becoming stressed again.

Although physical stress has largely disappeared from urban lives, we continue to rely on stress strategies that target physical stress when we're emotionally stressed. We're using the wrong kind of stress buffer.

How can you protect yourself from the effects of chronic stress?

Move at every opportunity throughout the day -- not with the aim to get fit or lose weight, but to offload stress. Walk around for five minutes every hour. Walk a stop instead of using transport. Take calls while walking; have walking meetings.

Dim the lights and wear blue light-blocking glasses if you use a screen late in the evening.  Avoid large meals, loud noise, excitement, caffeine and intense exercise in the evening. Get more daylight during the day.

Make sure you--not your environment--are controlling your attention. Delegate time for checking your phone, rather than allowing your phone to summon you. Schedule in periods of singular focus where you don't multi-task.

4. Hang out with your tribe.

Aim to be part of some kind of tribe, whom you identify with, feel comfortable around, and check in with regularly. According to latest research, even a virtual social tribe might do.

We now stay stressed for longer after experiencing the same things we used to quickly recover from.

Incorporating lost ""stress buffers"" such as these back into your lifestyle will help you recover faster from stress, and may help ensure your hard-earned success isn't attained at the cost of a poorer memory -- or worse, a possibly thinner brain.",
"In 2009, Amazon launched its first private-label brand, AmazonBasics. Today, Amazon has 100-plus private-label brands that offer more than 4,600 products. That explosive growth has been supported by rich data that Amazon mines from its marketplace. The modern monopoly's control over search results on its website, mobile app, and Alexa voice queries further exacerbates the problem by giving its own brands premium listing space (or in the case of some voice searches, the only listing).

To be clear, Amazon is a late comer to the private-label game. For decades, large retailers such as Walmart, BJ's, and CVS have placed private labels on their shelves at a cheaper price than other brands.

In the decades before the rise of online marketplaces, retailers stocked their shelves by making deals with big manufacturers like Procter & Gamble or Nestlé. Those big consumer-goods conglomerates wielded the power to shove out smaller brands, demand premium shelf space, and trade for other perks as part of their deals with big retailers like Walmart. Consequently, Walmart could, and did, use the data it gathered in its stores to build its own private-label brands.

On its face, Amazon's approach looks no different -- that is, it gathers data on products sold on the website and builds out a private-label strategy with that data. However, Amazon's platform business and market share give it advantages that brick-and-mortar retailers could only ever dream of.

The proliferation of Amazon's private-label brands has consumer-goods sellers squirming. Because Amazon prioritizes growth over profits, the tech giant has been able to move quickly across many product categories, from electronics to fashion to home and kitchen, pet products, cosmetics, health, and beyond. Like the private-label brands of traditional retailers, Amazon's products often sell for cheaper than other brands on its own market, and often (though not always) at a loss.

As Lina M. Khan wrote in The Yale Law Journal in an article discussing antitrust issues with Amazon, ""The economics of platform markets create incentives for a company to pursue growth over profits, a strategy that investors have rewarded. Under these conditions, predatory pricing becomes highly rational.""

Amazon's multi-channel revenue, including the revenue it makes from third-party sellers on its marketplaces, subsidizes its private-label experimentation and dominance. But Amazon's platform has done more than provide financial cover for Amazon's private-label brands: It has also provided the right data.

Amazon's marketplace catalog dwarfs even those of the largest traditional retailers, such as Walmart's catalog (especially pre-marketplace). Amazon democratized access to the consumer for sellers. Soon, small brands and living room product startups could open shop on a marketplace that commanded more than half of online sales.

That boon cut both ways. Amazon gained access to all the data for itself, and the quality of the data is much richer and more granular than any data collected by traditional retailers at their stores.

The combination of granular data and the democratization of access has quickly benefited Amazon, in a matter of years. Consider Anker, a smaller brand of portable battery packs, speakers, and other electronic goods. Before 2017, the brand was sold almost exclusively on Amazon's marketplace. Compare and contrast Anker's portable Bluetooth speaker with Amazon's. Anker's is $40 and Amazon's is $20.

Both even come in black, blue, and red! Notice Amazon is out of stock of its blue speaker. Most of its private-label brands carry a limited stock of each item to test its performance.

In addition to hyper-specific data mining, Amazon also accounts for 49 percent of online product searches, while another 36 percent of product searches start on Google and point to Amazon first (according to research firm Survata). Amazon can, and does, list its items before those of competitors. In the case of voice shopping via Alexa using generic product terms such as ""batteries,"" the smart speaker chooses an Amazon brand for the consumer (a practice that, among others, is inviting antitrust scrutiny).

How manufacturers and resellers should respond

Rather than just hoping that antitrust regulation is successfully brought against Amazon, product vendors should build or acquire a marketplace of their own. Listing stock on competing marketplaces is a good idea, but it isn't enough. The publishing industry tried that approach with books, and it found little success. By building or buying a competing marketplace, product companies can scale niche, specialized marketplaces that can serve as a competitive moat against Amazon.",
"In health care today, the conversation around transparency centers on the consumer. The consumer is empowered to ask for treatment options and costs, potential treatment risks, realistic outcomes, and much more. Health care providers must respond with as much information as possible to ensure appropriate care is delivered, quality and safety are top of mind, and patients and their care team can make thoughtful care decisions. It is impossible to have complete transparency with patients without first developing a strong culture of internal transparency — among all team members, at all levels, on all issues — throughout the health care organization itself. When team members are open and honest with each other, without fear, it leads to mutual trust, collaboration, and sharing of best practices across disciplines. Patients are the ultimate beneficiaries.

In health care today, the conversation around transparency centers on the consumer. The consumer is empowered to ask for treatment options and costs, potential treatment risks, realistic outcomes, and much more. Health care providers must respond with as much information as possible to ensure appropriate care is delivered, quality and safety are top of mind, and patients and their care team can make thoughtful care decisions.

I believe it is impossible to have complete transparency with patients without first developing a strong culture of internal transparency — among all team members, at all levels, on all issues — throughout the health care organization itself.

When team members are open and honest with each other, without fear, it leads to mutual trust, collaboration, and sharing of best practices across disciplines. Patients are the ultimate beneficiaries.

Shining a Light: Safer Health Care Through Transparency, a 2015 report by the National Patient Safety Foundation’s Lucian Leape Institute, states that “if transparency were a medication, it would be a blockbuster, with billions of dollars in sales and accolades the world over.” The report defines transparency as the free, uninhibited flow of information that is open to the scrutiny of others.

Barriers to internal transparency. A culture of internal transparency does not come about overnight. There can be many barriers, some of which can be quite complex. For example, employees may be reluctant to report safety issues or errors for fear of being reprimanded by their managers or shunned by their colleagues.

The Lucian Leape Institute report states that “from the quality and safety perspective, transparency is foundational for learning from mistakes and for creating a supportive environment for patients and health care workers.”

At Virginia Mason Medical Center in Seattle, for example, every employee is considered a safety inspector regardless of job or title. All our team members are expected and encouraged to file a patient safety alert whenever he or she sees anything that poses an immediate or potential safety risk. This level of internal transparency is necessary because leaders and team members cannot correct problems unless they know they exist.

Internal transparency is hindered when lessons learned aren’t shared freely across the enterprise. While many organizations have routine team huddles, it is critical to prioritize multidisciplinary huddles and encourage clinicians to break through silos by sharing information with their colleagues in other specialties and departments.

Providers are often hesitant to disclose mistakes to their patients even though a 2006 study in the Journal of General Internal Medicine concluded that full disclosure is associated with a lower likelihood of changing physicians, higher satisfaction, and greater trust.

Leaders must create a no-blame culture. The most effective way to build a culture of transparency begins with those in leadership positions. It is the responsibility of the leadership team to develop an atmosphere in which there is balanced accountability and continuous improvement and this is everyone’s shared duty. Leaders must lead by example.

A 2013 article in The Ochsner Journal, titled “Just Culture: A Foundation for Balanced Accountability and Patient Safety,” concluded that “a fair and just culture improves patient safety by empowering employees to proactively monitor the workplace and participate in safety efforts in the work environment.”

A new paradigm. When something isn’t working in health care, it can take a long time to change, but providers can reach their own unique breakthrough moment that serves as the catalyst for long-term transformation.

At Virginia Mason, we began nearly 20 years ago to create a culture in which our team members could believe zero-defect care is possible and have the tools to make this happen. We recognized that to achieve such a transformation, a paradigm shift was needed. Our management approach at the time was not nimble enough to keep up with the changing health care environment: We needed to eliminate wasteful elements from patient care, and we wanted to empower our employees to be stewards of patient safety, regardless of their job title.

To find an innovative way forward, we looked beyond our own industry because traditional approaches in health care management had not evolved much over the previous decades. In 2002, we implemented the Virginia Mason Production System (VMPS), a management method that employs basic principles of the Toyota Production System for eliminating waste (i.e., anything that lacks value from the patient’s perspective), improving quality and safety, and controlling cost.

This change did not happen easily. There were doubters and naysayers, as well as enthusiasts who were open-minded about exploring a new path. Some team members adopted a wait-and-see attitude. A few decided to leave our organization. There was a mix of optimism and a feeling of loss as it became clear that doing things as we’d always done them was no longer good enough.

By openly sharing information in employee forums and during one-on-one conversations over several months, we worked to help our team members understand that change was necessary for the future of the organization. We developed compacts with our physicians, board members, and leaders at all levels that clarified organizational expectations and what, in turn, they could expect from the organization. Our leaders — including department directors and managers — are required to practice VMPS methods and teach them to their teams. Completing a course in VMPS basics is an important part of the onboarding process for newly hired employees.  The result is a safer environment for patients and staff.

I believe all of us in health care have a moral imperative to make health care better and more affordable. Safety is the foundation of quality.

In 2004, one of our patients, Mary McClinton, died because of an avoidable error while she was in our care. That mistake shook us to our core as an organization. It also served as an inspiration to create an environment that is safe for every patient and team member, and to be open with our patients, staff, and the community about our work to continually improve safety. To honor Mrs. McClinton’s legacy, we created an annual award that recognizes a team that improves quality and safety through innovation. Their projects are shared broadly across the Virginia Mason organization so everyone understands how patients and care givers will benefit from the award-winning initiatives. Members of Mrs. McClinton’s family attend the award ceremony that is named for her.

In the United States, we have more information than ever about how to provide appropriate, high-quality care and keep patients safe. Transparency with internal and external stakeholders is essential for quality, safety, accountability, and informed decision making. As the Lucian Leape Institute report explains, transparency between clinicians and patients, among clinicians and health care organizations, and between health care organizations and the public produces safer care, better outcomes and more trust among all the involved parties.",
"Trace Genomics, which uses machine learning to analyze soil samples for farmers, announced Tuesday that it has closed a Series A funding round for $13 million. The round, led by Stage 1 Ventures, brings the company’s total venture funding to over $19 million.

Soil health has become an increasing concern for farmers, who are looking to maximize yields of their crops while also reducing the cost of inputs like fertilizers and pesticides. This is where Trace Genomics comes in—the company takes soil samples collected by farmers and analyzes them to determine what microbes are present in the soil. This enables the company to provide a report to farmers about what crop varieties they need to grow and what types of inputs would be ideal to use during the growing season.

“Trace Genomics has developed a highly scalable software and analytics platform to quantify soil productivity and offer actionable insights never before captured. It has the opportunity to transform how we measure sustainable and regenerative farm management practices,” Stage 1 Ventures operating partner Joseph Pianelli said in a statement.

The company was founded by Diane Wu and Poornima Parameswaran, who met at graduate school at Stanford while working in the lab of Dr. Andrew Fire, a Nobel Prize-winning geneticist. Parameswaran focused on molecular biology while Wu focused on computational biology. The two realized there was an opportunity to use advances in genomics and machine learning to provide actionable insights on soil health, which led them to found the company.

So far, the company has worked to help improve yields and also provide insight into disease management for crops like lettuce, berries, almonds and more. It has worked with farming associations like Western Growers, and its board members and advisors include agricultural industry heavyweights like Michael Tolle, owner and president of TN Farms; William Buckner, president and CEO of the Noble Research Institute; and Anthony Padgett, founder of Twenty Two North and owner of Padgett Farm Natural Beef.

With the new financing, Trace Genomics plans to expand its soil-health offerings to farmers of row crops like corn and soybeans, where a big challenge isn’t maximizing yields but rather maximizing margins in the face of record-low prices.

“The world is pretty open for us in terms of what we can impact moving forward,” said Diane Wu, the company’s CEO and a Forbes Under 30 alumnus. “Over 70 percent of decisions a soybean farmer makes is something we can impact with our technology.”

One of the most important of those decisions involves disease. A major risk for soybean farmers is a disease called sudden death syndrome, which does pretty much what it sounds like. The problem is, plants affected by this fungal disease don’t appear until late in the growing cycle, when there isn’t time to treat the plans and save the crop. This leaves farmers trying to determine whether they need to proactively treat crops. Wu says that her company’s product can detect the presence of the disease early, giving farmers better insight about what to do.

Another important factor for corn and soybean growers is the growing use of biological fertilizers—treatments for seeds in which different varieties of microbes are used to release nitrogen rather than using a conventional chemical-based fertilizer. The tests that Trace Genomics perform on the soil, says Parameswaran who serves as the company’s president, can help guide farmers to use the inputs that make the most sense for what they’re growing.

“Making these kinds of decisions for the growing season has been an art,” she said. “Now we want to make it a science.”",
"Sitting in the crowd at the seventh annual 3% Conference, I couldn’t help but think that if this conference had existed when I was 22 years old, it might have changed my life – or at least, my career.  Back then, I was a fresh college graduate who aspired to be an ad agency copywriter, and role models for female creative directors were in short supply. This was certainly not the case at this year’s 3% Conference, where inspiring female role models were front and center on stage, along with plenty of male diversity champions, too.

Founded in 2012 by Kat Gordon as the first conference for female creative directors in advertising, the 3% Conference was named to reflect the percentage of women creative leaders at the time, says Gordon. That number has now risen to 29%, she says, and as the percentage has expanded, so has the conference, which has broadened its message to embrace diversity and inclusion of all kinds.

“We’re no longer a women’s conference, we’re a business conference,” says Gordon, who is also the founder and CEO of The 3% Movement, the organization behind the conference, which has the goal of increasing diversity in advertising and related, creative fields. Bring It was the rallying cry of this year’s sold-out event, held at Chicago’s Navy Pier on November 8 and 9. The conference featured leaders (of both genders) from across the agency spectrum, as well as a line-up of entrepreneurs including Sallie Krawcheck, CEO and co-founder of Ellevest, and Emma McIlroy, CEO and co-founder of fashion brand Wildfang, along with executives from companies like Google, Facebook and Apple.

The sessions unflinchingly addressed the myriad dimensions of diversity, with titles like, ""How to Fail,"" ""Designing for Inclusivity"" and ""Mind the Backlash."" The speakers and panel discussions were notable for their candor, as one person after another – both on stage and in the audience- shared their thoughts and personal experiences.

During the event, The 3% Movement announced results from its “Parenting in Adland,” survey, in which the vast majority of respondents – 91% of mothers and 82% of fathers – agreed that “the ad industry is a challenging place for parents.""  While those numbers may not be entirely surprising, the point was that parenting issues do not involve women only – they are inclusive of men, too.  The organizers also announced that 17 agencies had signed on as founding members of the 3% Pledge for Pay Equity, an initiative designed to close the wage gap in advertising.  (Learn more about the program here.)

In an interview, Lisen Stromberg, partner & COO of The 3% Movement, recalled the tipping point that helped launch the movement:  “Talent was leaving, agencies saw a brain drain and brands started to recognize that it’s a business issue because their consumers are 80% female.”  On its website, The 3% Movement states that its goal is to put themselves out of business.  If this year’s conference was any indication, it may be one step closer.",
"When business slows or a blind spot in company-to-customer interaction becomes known, some companies choose to rebrand. This could mean a complete brand overhaul, including a new name and a refresh of logos, fonts, color schemes, etc.

Rebranding is a tricky business. While a new look has the ability to draw in new customers, it also has the potential to lose you old customers who don’t like change. It’s a fine line to balance the old and the new.

To help, seven members of Young Entrepreneur Council discuss their most effective strategies to refresh a brand when the company is headed in a new direction. This is what they had to say:

Most companies have the design elements of their brands on target, but the voices are quite saturated. The truth is, there is a significant lack of high-quality marketing writers who can graft, draft and create an impressive voice for a company. There's so much noise in the world today, especially among budding businesses. The voice needs to come from the design and the words used; a great time to rebrand is when you create that focal point of communication for your company and make sure your customers are listening. - Nicole Munoz, Nicole Munoz Consulting, Inc.

We like to think we can determine our own brands, but it is our customers who decide who we are and what our names mean. The Dunkin' rebranding is crisp and catchy and it’s backed by ads that are all about breakfast, not just donuts. It's hard to leverage the term ""donut"" in a world that is focused on keto diets and juicing; I think their rebranding is focused on the customer who wants a quick hot breakfast, and it fits their image. Think of the customer. What's on their mind? Who do they think you are? Does it need to be quick to remember? Those questions cannot be answered in the boardroom; you have to get out and ask. Once you've captured the idea, working with talented designers can take it to the next level by matching images with words to create an experience. - Daniel Griggs, ATX Web Designs, LLC

3. Start from the inside out.

An effective brand refresh starts from the inside out and is felt internally as much as it's felt externally. Your brand refresh should be felt on a cultural level. After all, your employees are your ultimate brand ambassadors and getting them on board is a must. They need to know your brand essence, which is the heart and soul of your brand and the foundation upon which your brand is built. Your employees should also know your brand positioning statement and have access to brand assets for verbal and visual expression. Finally, develop a brand persona to give your employees a personified perspective on your brand that they can seek to emulate. Invest in brand strategy and communicate that strategy internally before taking it to market. Your people are your brand. - Robby Scott Berthume, Bull & Beard

4. Enhance the UI of your portal.

We deliver our services via a proprietary portal that our customers, patients and internal employees utilize daily. As a startup, we originally focused more on the creation and applications of our portal than the aesthetics. However, as our company grew we wanted a more modern feel. While it was a significant investment to overhaul the UI, it provided huge dividends because every stakeholder in our company utilizes the portal on a daily basis. The development phase created unique opportunities to obtain customer opinions. The launch of the new UI was an exciting topic to discuss with potential customers. Our internal employees were so thrilled with the new approach. Even though the functionality of our portal stayed the same, the enhanced UI breathed new life into our daily activities. - Amanda Elms, Metis Genetics, LLC

If customers are no longer receiving an experience that makes them want to come back to your business, embracing transparency is a good way to separate yourself from your competitors. Too many businesses deliberately hide their weaknesses in an effort to keep revenue up. This is only a band-aid to the problem -- and not a very good one. Don't be afraid to look bad. Domino's publicly embraced its failures and managed to revamp its entire franchise by accepting feedback from its customers. Domino's products continue to sell because it doesn't claim to be something it's not and chooses to prioritize the customer experience instead. - Reuben Yonatan, GetVoIP

6. Pull out all the stops.

If you're going to rebrand your company, you shouldn't just change its name, logo, social media presence or website; you should change all of the above! The way to ensure that your rebranding is most effective is to go all out and avoid any half measures. You should reinvent yourself from top to bottom in order to attract significant attention and publicity while also ensuring that your new image actually sticks. It will take considerably more time and money, but the results will be worth the effort. Just look at Yahoo's logo redesign back in 2013. Despite all the money and press that surrounded it, no one cared. It failed to build momentum by not changing any other aspect of its business. - Bryce Welker, Accounting Institute for Success

7. Publicize all the way.

No matter whether you create a new logo or opt for a change in name, your efforts will not lead to the desired results if you don’t publicize the change. Make sure you cover different mediums, be it online or print. Your website serves as a very important marketing tool, so make sure it is user friendly and provides information in an organized manner. Spread the word about your company’s rebranding through different social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Online marketing videos are all the rage now, so consider taking this route as well. Trade shows give you easy means to highlight any change in your business. In the case of Dunkin’s rebrand, the company also has the resources to publicize its move through print and television ads. - Derek Robinson, Top Notch Dezigns",
"It’s well-established in the field of human development that sponsors are a strong vehicle to developing talent. In a business setting, sponsors are senior leaders who are willing to invest their own reputation advocating for an employee behind closed doors. This is how a sponsor differs from a mentor: Sponsors have an investment that mentors don’t. The protégé's career outcome is a direct reflection of the sponsor’s advocacy, and thus the sponsor works harder to ensure favorable outcomes and everybody wins. Mentors have an interest and provide sound advice, but they are not necessarily providing air cover and counting on the success of a mentee the same way a sponsor counts on a protégé to be successful.

The trouble is sponsorship is completely informal and hard to nail down. Sponsors choose who they want to invest in and it is typically not driven by the formal talent processes human capital teams lead. Many of those conversations end with mentors being assigned. And that will have value, but it is not the same as sponsorship. Defining and understanding how this relationship works is further complicated because sponsors don’t always declare themselves such. It is so often unstated that the protégés don’t even fully know when they are sponsored and what the implications can be.

If diversity practitioners are going to move the needle in advancing minorities and women in the organization, then we have to figure out how to use this tool more effectively. Talking with many sponsors, there are a few themes that remain consistent.

Sponsors have the power to influence outcomes and are willing to do so. Sometimes the relationship is built on an exchange of offers — what the protégé does for the sponsor and what the sponsor does for the protégé, which may or may not be explicit.

Sponsors choose who they want to help and their reasons for doing so are as varied as leaders'. Allowing that choice is important and formal programs hinder that. And yet, too often, minorities and women are last to be chosen if they're chosen at all. If we cannot address this, we will never change the pipeline.

One important first step an organization can take is to build a discussion of sponsorship into talent discussions. Understanding who is sponsored will help you understand who is not. If women and minorities are not sponsored, then you do not have a diverse pipeline. Knowing that, you can begin to ask and explore why they are not sponsored. This can root out any unintended unconscious bias that we acknowledge is always at play. The best defense against this bias is to bring it to the table for discussion. It is with consciousness that we make better decisions. Employers need to get conscious about sponsorship and who is getting this access.

Once you have determined who is sponsored and who is not, you must also consider who is working on important initiatives in the firm. The work one gets to work on matters. It determines who you will meet with and who will consider your outcomes. Preparing an update for the senior team or the CEO is different than preparing an update for an executive sponsor on work that is important but not visible. Look to see if women and minorities are on the larger projects because those who are will be ready for the next level sooner. The experience gained from high-level assignments is invaluable.

Finally, look at those who have identified sponsors and those on top-level projects and you will have distilled your pipeline.  If it is not as diverse as you would like, determine which employees you would like to see developed. Identify the next projects coming and determine how these employees can get key roles in leading the work. Give them mentors to support their success. And if you can, let the mentors know that they will be evaluated on the success of the employee. If the mentor is willing (and it should be optional), then you have created the opportunity for sponsorship to grow. Many times, the relationship can grow if people have a real opportunity to get to know each other. Unconscious bias makes that more difficult because like is attracted to like and that reality leaves women and minorities not chosen. Creating this kind of partnership and accountability can hopefully extend beyond the project. And the success of the project should be good for the mentee and the mentor, creating a win for everyone.

Taking these steps can help an organization’s leaders have a realistic view of the current state, while also working to improve the future state. Firms can also require leaders to find protégés to sponsor. They can choose whomever they want, but they must sponsor some women and minorities. This step may seem counter to the informality of the relationship, but it is not. The most significant part of the informality is getting to choose who you will care about and invest in. An employer should not remove that but just require of its leaders that they actively sponsor other leaders. It is good for their development and the development of a leadership pipeline. Making explicit the expectation that women and minorities be included in that effort reduces the unconscious bias but requires leaders to be conscious about their efforts to include. These steps can put on you the path to strengthening the diversity of your bench by using an everyday tool that is hiding in plain sight.",
"Generation Z is about to change the face of the workforce.

These new workers don’t remember a world without the internet and smartphones. They’ve witnessed hard times for their parents during the Great Recession. They’re coming of age in the era of #MeToo. And no, they’re not Millennials.

The older members of this substantial group — more than 61 million individuals in the U.S. alone, often defined as the generation born between 1996 and 2010 — are now breaking into the labor force and should make up one-fifth of it by 2021. Gen Z brings expectations and aspirations that differ from its Millennial predecessors.

While Millennials (also known as Generation Y) have sought work with a purpose, Gen Zers, driven by the fear of experiencing another recession, place a premium on a stable paycheck and a secure job. Shaped also by the #MeToo era, these upcoming workers expect authenticity and transparency from management. And where Millennials eschew linear advancement in favor of their own path of development, this new generation seems eager to pursue an upward route.

These and many other distinctions raise key questions for your workplace. The culture you create, the tools (read: tech) you provide, and the general environment you establish can go a long way in attracting the best of young workers. If you want to be well-prepared for the new wave, consider three critical Gen Z traits and how they can help your company evolve.

You’re preparing your workplace for the first generation of digital natives. They’re not merely comfortable with technology, they live and breathe it. Yet many managers are still surprisingly oblivious to the fact that their offices aren’t delivering a truly digital environment.

Forward-thinking organizations like PwC are making digital fitness (as they call it) a business imperative. Half of the new recruits that PwC hired last year were recent college graduates and other half were people with experience in the workforce. So they will be welcoming a lot of Gen Zers into their workforce in the coming years. To show the organization just how important digital is, they created a new leadership position – Chief Digital Officer – and appointed senior partner Joe Atkinson to the role. He says “My role is to be ‘a constructive disrupter.’ My mission is to enhance digital fitness throughout the organization and put in place the learning and technology necessary to get the entire organization comfortable with the language and concepts that are driving digital innovation.”

“For many companies, outdated technology is just the result of the business itself,” says Saagar Govil, CEO of Cemtrex, a company that develops fully integrated “smart” office products. “You can get so focused on the day-to-day operations that you lose sight of the resources available to make things run that much smoother.”

As a result, many executives simply remain unaware of current trends in technology and the basic assumptions that digital natives will bring to the workplace — namely, that devices should be connected, and resources shouldn’t be wasted. These presumptions might prompt changes as obvious as going paperless or adding more screens to increase productivity. Or they may lead you to utilize fresh software such as Jamboard for brainstorm sessions or Vidyard for internal communications. Anything that could reduce the friction of getting work done or smooth workflow is fair game for an upgrade.

Yes, you’ve already cultivated a collaborative culture for your Millennial teams. You’ve migrated to Slack, knocked down the office walls, and assigned teamwork. But Gen Zers are fiercely independent and competitive, boasting a “do-it-myself” attitude. They’re not afraid to go head-to-head with their teammates to prove their mettle.

That’s not to say both workplace attitudes can’t coexist. Beyond initiating contests or other in-house competitions among your staff, technology again provides a creative solution. The recent surge in gamification software offers a unique way to engage this competitive spirit. Used primarily in training programs, the software facilitates competition (and fun) by making training into a game replete with points, badges, and leaderboards.

Whatever methods or tools you use, fanning Gen Zers’ competitive flame may prove critical for the workplace of the decades ahead.

3. Design your space to balance the social and the solitary.

While these new workers may be competitive, they nonetheless value the chance to be part of a team. In fact, striking the right social-solitary balance in the workspace, along with other aspects of your office’s physical design, is vital to creating a healthy working environment for this up-and-coming cohort.

Much has been said about the startlingly high levels of loneliness within Generation Z, which topped the UCLA Loneliness Scale with a score of 48.3 in a recent Cigna study. Still other research reveals high levels of anxiety and distrust among Gen Zers. Designing a space that encourages collaboration and openness, yet still allows for needed breakaway work, may prove pivotal in their success.

Millennials and Gen Zers do share many traits, and your office design can incorporate that common ground. Whether it be incorporating multifunctional furniture, vibrant colors, or plenty of sunlight and plant life into the office space, both generations prefer a thoughtfully designed space that is aesthetically pleasing, not just functional.

Over the past two decades, Millennials have clearly reshaped the culture of the modern workplace, but their younger coworkers are poised to reshape it yet again. Enhancing your office’s tech, fostering a culture of healthy competition, and rethinking your workplace design are but a few ways you can invite the unique contributions of Gen Z into your company. Adapting to the new workforce’s expectations sooner rather than later will give your company a competitive edge. What is your organization doing to attract the next generation?

"For business owners, entertaining and dining with clients, vendors and potential employees is a successful strategy for building strong business relationships. While these expenses are essential for your business to run smoothly, the related tax benefits may be long gone thanks to tax reform. By now, every business owner should be aware of the once-in-a-generation tax law changes that were passed at the end of 2017. But small business owners might not be fully aware of how these changes apply to their meals and entertainment (M&E) expenses. While a detailed analysis of tax reform as a whole is too much to digest for any one article, let’s take a look at how the new M&E rules affect your business.

Under prior law, you could generally deduct 50% of meals and entertainment expenses, unless a specific exception applied in which they would be 100 deductible. The IRS has clarified that meals are food or beverages, and entertainment is pretty much anything of entertainment, amusement or recreational value. These definitions were intentionally vague, and the list of exceptions for full deductibility included office holiday parties as well as meals, snacks and beverages considered to be fringe benefits.

Tax reform has eliminated the tax deduction for most business entertainment expenses. But there are always exceptions to the rule, and this one is no different. These are the nine exceptions:

1. Food and beverages for employees: These amounts may still be deductible if there’s a business purpose.

2. Expenses treated as compensation: Entertaining employees will be fully deductible.

3. Reimbursed expenses: Expenses that are not treated as compensation and are reimbursed by customers are fully deductible.

4. Recreational expenses for employees: Examples including facilities maintained by the business and company outings such as company picnics are fully deductible.

5. Employee, stockholder, etc., business meetings: Bona fide business meetings of employees or shareholders are considered fully deductible. For C corps and S corps that are required to hold periodic board meetings, this exception offers significant tax savings.

6. Meetings of business leagues: These resemble club dues but the organization must be qualified 501c(6) nonprofit and not just a social in nature. For sole proprietors and LLCs, this is significant, as they rely on many of these organizations to support their business.

7. Items available to public: Food and beverages given to the general public are considered fully deductible.

8. Entertainment sold to customers: If entertainment is purchased to be sold to customers it is not subject to limitation.

9. Expenses includible in the income of persons who are not employees: Similar to exception No. 2 but for contractors or other parties.

Another exception to the disallowed entertainment deductions was recently clarified to exempt certain entertainment expenses that are ordinary and necessary in the course of business. For example, theater tickets would generally be considered an entertainment expense for most companies. But for someone who is a professional journalist or critic, these expenses are ordinary and necessary to perform their income-generating work. In this example, the expense would be considered fully deductible.

Business meals with clients are still 50% deductible, but there are new stipulations to meet the business meal threshold. The new tax law did not specifically address business meals with clients as meals or entertainment. Treasury will write regulations in the future, but for now, to be considered a business meal and not entertainment, there are four objective tests that will be used to make a determination.

1. The meal must take place between you or your employee(s) and a current or prospective client.

2. The expense is incurred at a restaurant and not an entertainment venue such as a nightclub, cocktail lounge or sports arena.

3. The meal is not lavish or extravagant under the circumstances.

4. There’s a reasonable expectation of deriving income or other business benefit from the meeting.

Perhaps the biggest limitation comes through employer-provided fringe benefits. Previously, you could fully deduct food and beverages provided to employees through a cafeteria, as well as other food and beverages at the workplace such as coffee and donuts, working meals and overtime meals. After tax reform, unless these are served as part of a recreational event, these expenses are only 50% deductible. Ultimately, this makes employer-provided fringe benefits more expensive on an after-tax cost basis.

While not specifically related to M&E, the same code section of the law now also disallows deductions for transportation fringe benefits such as transit passes and employee parking. To see tax savings, business owners could include these amounts as compensation to take advantage of the exceptions stated above.

Now more than ever, companies need to understand their M&E expenses and ensure they are properly categorized and deducted to maximize tax benefits. Companies should review the tax treatment of their M&E expenses to capitalize on the limitation exceptions as well as work to minimize their nondeductible or partially deductible expenses.

To properly accomplish integrating tax reform changes, companies will need to make changes to their accounting and expense reporting systems and processes immediately. The most obvious change will come through granular ledger detail by expanding the chart of accounts to accurately categorize their M&E expenses.

At a high level, most entertainment expenses are nondeductible and most meals are 50% deductible. Previously, entertainment expenses were 50% deductible and a broader array of meals had the potential to be 100% deductible. The IRS is expected to heavily scrutinize this area of tax reform, so it’s important that your partners and employees properly enter and describe their activity in reporting expenses.",
"Millennials (those born between 1980 and the early 2000s) now represent the largest generation in the U.S. workforce, according to Pew Research Center. Not only are millennials the fastest growing workforce, but also they are becoming the new “sandwich generation,” often taking care of younger children and aging parents simultaneously and within the same household. In fact, a record 64 million Americans live in a multigenerational household.

The result is that millennials who have kids and parents under the same roof are going to be carefully considering companies that offer great benefits not only for themselves but for their dependent family members. The numbers are staggering: Pew’s analysis of data from the U.S. Census Bureau revealed that last year, 56 million millennials were working or looking for work -- that's more than the 53 million Generation Xers who make up a third of the workforce.

While a lot has been written about millennial traits, a critical look at millennials you know, especially those in the sandwich generation, will likely point you in the right direction to address benefits that are of interest. The millennials I know are technologically savvy, motivated by a variety of tasks and a flexible work schedule, prefer to work in a collaborative team culture and want to work for an environmentally friendly company that gives back to the community, nation and planet.

It will take a commitment from every department to be sure that you offer the right benefits, which can include time off for charity work, paternity and maternity leave, and ridesharing, to name a few. The way you document and share this information can have a significant impact on recruiting and retention success.

Your company’s HR and marketing teams must be able to create internal and external content that clearly articulates all your benefits. Most of those benefits are easy to explain. If, for example, your company offers a club/gym membership or has a workout facility on-site, it is pretty straightforward to understand and document. Conversely, selecting the right health care option is complex, impacts the employees’ paychecks and is one of the most important benefits to the sandwich generation.

Helping millennials understand high-deductible health plans (HDHPs) and HSAs should be at the top of the recruiting and new-hire orientation list. Why? Because according to another study by Pew Research Center, 1.2 million millennial women had their first baby in 2016, raising the number of millennial moms to 17 million. Additionally, Visa’s recent presentation at the 2018 ECFC symposium featured research showing that only 35% of millennials own a health savings account (HSA). A great health plan will become a key factor when millennials make a career move or decide to stay with their current employer.

Having a great health plan is not enough. It's important that employers understand these benefits so they can better educate their employees -- something I often coach fellow business executives on. Employees need to understand that to have an HSA they need to have an HDHP, which is a plan with lower premiums and higher deductibles than a traditional health plan.

With an HSA, millennials can save money today and set aside money for the future. And when the time comes that they need that money for medical bills, they can have peace of mind knowing that funds are available. Here’s what millennials need to know:

• Money in an HSA can be an investment. Mutual funds, stocks and bonds are often available through a brokerage account. Simply stated, an HSA is a type of retirement account.

• HSA money can be carried over every year. It isn’t like paid vacation time where you “use it or lose it.” It's important that millennial employees understand this, especially since health care costs typically increase every year.

• The tax advantages are significant. Contributions are pre-tax, free from Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) taxes and grow on a deferred basis. And when millennials need the funds for approved medical expenses, withdrawals are not taxed.

There are a plethora of insights and options to share when it comes to HSAs; this is where your organization can stand out through transparent discussions and resources that can answer questions and provide clear documentation. Here are a few key points to include in HSA communications for millennials:

• An HSA is similar to a regular savings account but with an annual limit.

• In 2019, the HSA contribution limit for employees under the age of 55 will be $3,500 for an individual and $7,000 for a family.

• Employees can also contribute to their HSA outside of payroll, such as through a credit union or bank.

• If the HSA is paired with an HDHP, provide information on whether your company offers a wellness program that can help people stop unhealthy habits like smoking.

• HDHPs with HSAs are usually the least expensive health coverage option for employees.

• Your HSA stays with you during your entire career; it can go with you when you leave the company, or you can open another one.

If your organization puts the time and effort into understanding millennial employees and their evolving family needs, you will be in a great position to recruit and retain a strong workforce. By educating millennials about the investment features an HSA provides, they can make informed decisions about this vital employee benefit not only for themselves but also for their dependent family, all while also planning for retirement. There is a lot at stake.",
"Have you ever felt that the moment you walk into the office each day you have to put on a persona that’s not quite “you”? In other words, you feel like you’re pretending — pretending to be the leader your team thinks you are and pretending to be the confident, capable businessperson who's closing deals and giving PowerPoint presentations.

About 40% of the leaders I've met — even the most successful ones — suffer from these feelings, which add up to what is called imposter syndrome. They fear that, at any moment, someone will come up to them and say, “You don’t really belong here.” They think that everyone else deserves to be in the room, but not them. They wonder, “When will people figure out that I’m not up to the job?” They carry the weight of living a lie at work while everyone else goes about their day unencumbered by guilt and the fear of exposure.

From the outside, no one imagines that such highly productive, talented executives feel this way. Yet I repeatedly hear different versions of the same story. In the programs we run with leaders, we ask this question early on: “What is the part of you most people don’t see that is a key part of who you are?” In response, we hear the full range of fears that we all live with that others don’t see. Fear of being an imposter is one of the most common. But why?

The world seems to have no problem telling us what the perfect version of what we do should look like. The number of times I've talked to an executive and unpacked the impossible list of requirements of what they believe they should be able to do is too many to count. Thus, we end up spending our time believing that everyone else but us has what it takes.

I once ran a program for the faculty at West Point that included many individuals who had done two or three tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan. If ever there was a group that deserved to be teaching the cadets, it was this group. Guess what — they all thought that someone had made a mistake by letting them teach at West Point. They all felt that everyone else looked confident and deserved to be there.

This should not come as a huge surprise in today’s world, where there's no end to the expectations and demands on who we should be. But in trying to meet these expectations, we all too often fail to connect with one thing that ties our seemingly disparate parts together into a coherent whole: purpose.

Purpose describes the unique gift we bring to the world and always have. It's the core of who we are as individuals and what we can do that no one else can. It's present in every instant of our lives and evident in how we interact with the challenges of the moment.

Purpose also happens to be the one surefire remedy I’ve seen for imposter syndrome. Purpose shows us who we really are and always have been. It's that authenticity that earns respect and induces others to follow us. This loop of enhanced authenticity and energized followers can reinforce the positive feelings — of belonging, capability and assuredness — that melt imposter syndrome. In fact, imposter syndrome diminishes greatly when you discover and begin living your purpose.

There are a few simple things you can do to stay grounded in the space that over time will lead you to discover your purpose. One is to examine the proudest moments you’ve experienced. Ask what it was, specifically, that you brought to each of those moments that made you proud. It may not be as tangible as you’d expect. Take James, for example, a senior procurement executive I worked with. He grew up sailing and was so good that he was selected as an Olympic team alternate. But what he’s most proud of is not that accolade but the sentiment he tapped into on deck. As he told me, “You never know what the wind will do next, and in the end, it’s only your combined capabilities, intuition and flow and how you read the elements that win the race.” Many times, when you talk about moments that make you proud, your purpose will be smiling back at you.

Another way to discover your purpose is to look at the most challenging moments in your life. No one digs out of a mess the same way, and how we get back in the game is a powerful indicator of the purpose that leads us. As a teenager, my family moved a number of times, but one move was really tough on me. I remember going to a bookstore almost every day for weeks and reading story after story about those who had turned adversity into opportunity. I understood that I had a choice to make: Either be the victim or realize that we're all capable of great things in our lives. Thinking about that moment and what I did to dig myself out over the next year helped me see my purpose, which is to always find the deeper truth that will show us the way.

We must think beyond our title or job description, no matter what hat we happen to be wearing. Your purpose is the one identity you'll always have, whether you're on your kid’s soccer field, volunteering in a soup kitchen or at the podium with your slide deck. If you lose your job or quit coaching soccer or serving soup, your purpose will remain intact and available.

When the leaders I’ve worked with have stepped into and followed their individual purpose, they've felt less like an imposter and led more effectively. So will you.",
"My 30 years of management consulting has afforded me the opportunity to work with some of the best, and worse, leaders around. What I've discovered as a result that regardless of one's particular leadership gifts and foibles, a leader can always become better, if they set their mind to it.

Indeed, the difference between a run-of-the-mill leader and one that many would consider exceptional is the willingness and dedication to improve. As the old adage suggests, all you have to do is try.

With that, here are 10 things that you can try to help you to become a better leader:

1.     Stop Being a Jerk: Bad bosses are ones that typically discount their people and treat them like disposable commodity.  You don't have to be that person.  Rather, just try to be a decent person. Respect other's opinions and seek out differing points of view. It will make you more approachable and a commitment to being a decent person may be your first step towards becoming a better leader.

2.     Be a Disruptor: Some of the best leaders give themselves the right to dare to think differently than others.  Think Steve Jobs, Elon Musk and Bill Gates.  Work to become deliberate in challenging the status quo, and you just might begin to gain a followership within the rank-and-file of your business.

3.     Envision Tomorrow: Vision is another characteristic of remarkable leaders.  Work to connect disparate ideas from multiple disciplines within your business, and you may begin to see patterns that can lead to breakthrough ideas about the future.

4.     Become a Story Teller: Great leaders communicate at all levels.  They tend to use stories to get their ideas across. Work on crafting engaging and informative narratives as a way to communicate and inspire and watch how your leadership cred grows within your organization.

5.     Radiate Trust: Would you follow someone that you don't trust? Neither will your people! The best thing that you can do to build trust is to say what you mean and do what you say.  Is that simple.

6.     Promote ""In It Togetherness:"" There is no ""I"" in team.  You can foster the notion that your team wins together by being inclusive and consciously leveraging all of the skills and experiences that your people bring to work each day.

7.     Be an Enabler: Inevitably, your team will confront resistance and adversity in their quest to perform.  Be a leader that they can count on by identifying and knocking out the organizational road blocks that can hinder your team's success.  This is a trait of a leader worth following.

8.     Continually Coach: One of your key roles as a leader is to develop those that work for you.  Don't forget to continually teach and coach your team. Remember, you win when they win (see ""In It Together"" above), so it's in your best interest to help them become all that they can be.

9.     Keep Score: It's essential that you recognize results, not effort. If your people see that you fairly disseminate praise and rewards based on results and not favoritism, they'll give you their best effort. After all, your willingness to not play favorites is part of being honest leader.

10.  Adopt an Outsider's POV: Valued leaders are ones that keep it fresh and challenging.  One way to accomplish this is to adopt an outsider's point of view of your operation. Think of the impressions that you team and business leave in the eyes of your stakeholders, and you just may see ways to make things better for your business and properly motivate your team.

To close, I hope that you find these ideas worth a try.  Done well, you will become a brilliant leader.  Keep in mind, though, it does require effort and a commitment to continually develop new leadership skills and behaviors on your part. With that, the sky is the limit.",
"There's a saying in business that ""cash is king,"" and that's the absolute truth. Without cash, you can't hire the best talent. Without cash, you can't afford that fancy office space (or any office space at all). Without cash, your business isn't a business.

Every type of company has some kind of sales department. Sales could mean signing on advertising partners. Sales could mean knocking down doors and getting clients for a specific service. Regardless of what type of sales your company requires in order to generate cash, the key to sales is hiring the right people to spearhead the department.

In order to hire all-star sales managers, here are the four things you need to look for--and the qualities you need to encourage over the long term:

1. The capacity to train and be trainable.

First, the individual needs to be talented enough to be able to train the people they'll be leading. This requires both in-depth knowledge of their particular domain, as well as a knack for being able to articulate their experience in a way that other team members can internalize and put to the test.

Second, the individual needs to be willing to continue learning as well. One of the worst qualities a manager can possess is ""not knowing what they don't know."" They think just because they've been leading sales teams for a few years, they know all the answers. But the best sales managers are great at sharing what they know, while also remaining open to learning things they might not know fully yet.

2. One eye always on the analytics.

The best sales managers are always looking to draw conclusions from the data they're capturing. For example, one large order could make a sales person look like he or she is performing exceedingly well, when in reality there may be dozens of other prospective customers that are being left unattended. These are things to be expected in a business, and should be looked at closely.

There's a second on this topic in my book, All In. One of the best qualities you can find in a sales manager is self awareness. Remember, people in sales aren't ""machines."" They're human beings who need to feel connected to the company as a whole, and understand the impact of the work they're doing. As a result, you don't want to hire a sales manager who sees the department differently, and makes hiring decisions that go against your own beliefs as a leader.

The secondary component to this is ensuring that the person you put in charge (the sales manager) continues to nurture the talent they bring onto the team. One mistake sales managers make is hiring people, training them for a month or two, and then never bothering to check up on their performance. They assume things are going fine--instead of being proactive and looking for new ways to help them improve further.

Reason being, too many sales teams think that ""just sell more"" is a worthwhile strategy. It's not. If you tell someone to run one mile, they'll run one mile. But if you tell someone to run as far as they can, they'll probably run for a half a mile and then stop.

Once these targets have been set, the next step is to ensure the sales manager and their subsequent team has the tools and resources they need in order to be successful. People need to know how their progress is being measured, and how they are expected to reach the targets laid out in front of them. And a great sales manager not only provides all of this information, but works to monitor performance at every step of the way--constantly looking for opportunities to provide more clarity and help everyone else become even more successful.",
"Stan Lee had a material impact on  the person I am today. Much of my success in work and life I owe to the lessons I learned from his characters and how he lived. During San Diego Comic-Con a few years back, I got to sit down with my hero and interview him for a documentary on ADHD and superheroes as role models. I even wrote a book about superheroes and the business lessons they can teach, called How to Be a Business Superhero.

I don't want to simply focus on the characters he created, but also on the man himself. Stan Lee's journey was purposeful, deliberate, and anything but easy. Here are the five things I take from a life well lived and the legends he created.

1. Go where others don't.

Lee, like many of his contemporaries in the comic book business, was Jewish. He was excluded from many traditional creative avenues of work in the late 1930s because of rampant antisemitism. So he went where others didn't, forgoing his quest to write the great American novel and instead writing what he could get paid for: comics. He went on to revitalize the flailing comic book industry and inspire millions. This was a lesson I applied to my life when I became an investor: I focused on funding companies that others don't.

2. Know that we are all flawed.

Stan Lee's characters define the silver age of comics (1964-1986). Unlike their pulp predecessors, all of Lee's heroes were flawed: Daredevil was blind, Spider-Man was a teenager who couldn't afford rent, and the X-Men were feared by those they were trying to protect. Lee's superheroes are relatable. As I have matured in business, I have learned to accept my own flaws, because flaws are what make us human. Acknowledging this also drives up your emotional intelligence, which is directly related to leadership success.

Daredevil is a blind lawyer who fights crime using his remaining heightened senses. The X-Men were made outcasts because they were different. As a youth I struggled with crippling learning disabilities and ADHD, but Lee helped me re-frame my adversity and turn it into a driving force in my life. I told myself that the daily bullying I experienced could have purpose if I used it to my advantage--if I let that friction make me into a diamond. Today, I subscribe to the the theory that neurodiversity is an evolved trait that can be harnessed for good. The lesson here is that the glass is both half full and half empty: it is you who decides the perspective.

4. Always use an adjective.

The Spectacular Spider-Man. The Incredible Hulk. The Uncanny X-Men. Lee never missed a chance to include a superfluous adjective. This was a sly way to embed a tagline about the mood of each comic, distinguishing it from its cousins at DC comics, like Superman, Green Lantern, and Justice League.

When my business partner and I founded our last company, which we eventually sold for $25 million, we took Lee's lesson to heart. We focused on the extremely high end of the market in order to avoid commodity pricing. I described our product as ""extraordinary"" and build a tagline to match: ""The most expensive available today, and worth every penny."" The takeaway here is that to be the best, you should focus on the one adjective you want customers to associate with your product.

The concept of noblesse oblige (that those in power are obligated to use it responsibility) predates Lee by a century, but he made it the cornerstone of the Spider-Man mythos. Peter Parker's selfish inaction--not using his superpowers to stop a petty criminal--leads to the death of his beloved Uncle Ben. This loss leads Parker to dedicate his life to fighting crime.",
"The best leaders understand that failure is naturally a part of the business experience. Also, they know that when it happens, they can use those lessons learned to improve their decision-making processes moving forward.

At my company Amerisleep, our team has figured out how to turn failure into fortune. We train our employees to pilot promising projects and reflect when the results underperform expectations. This allows us gather valuable business intelligence that helps us tweak existing strategies and turn them into ROI-positive initiatives.

Express during hiring that failure is a part of the job description, and embrace risk as a core value.

The most effective way to prepare people for the inevitability of occasional failure is to start at the very beginning, and that means addressing the issue during your hiring process. Clear expectations are a crucial part of managing employee performance, and establishing early on that failure is common result of taking risks and organizational growth will help you frame company priorities in a way that promotes continual improvement.

The freedom to take risks is only possible when people understand that failure is an inherent consequence involved in doing so. Reactions to failure are generally driven by fear, and according to a study by the Harvard Business Review, businesspeople are more likely to depend on survival instead of growth when they don't understand their own fears, especially surrounding failure.

Teach employees to internalize failure as a cost of innovation.

Leaders are often reluctant to talk about failure with their employees, and it's easy to understand why. The word carries a negative connotation, and this is part of what needs to change if organizations are going to get better about embracing failure strategically.

One way to soften the negative undertones of failure is to tie it to a concept that is viewed more favorably: innovation. Everything in life and in business can be viewed through a cost-benefit framework, and periodic failure is one of the costs we must accept to reap the rewards of successful innovation.

Train them to use tools to help them learn from mistakes.

The real value of failure can only be extracted when you have the infrastructure in place to analyze what contributed to it and use the data to inform future decisions.

It's just as crucial for your team members to reflect on the events that led to failure and learn from them as it is for you as their leader to look holistically at the team's performance. Make sure they know what tools are available to aid them. Then, train them on methods and procedures for postmortem analysis.

Analyze what went right as well.",
"For Mia Lehrer being a landscape urbanist has always transcended the textbook definition of the craft. Through her firm, Studio-MLA, Lehrer has worked on projects with Dodger Stadium and efforts around the LA River, alike, but along the way has never forgotten how the power of advocacy and landscape architecture can go hand in hand.

“Through advocacy we can educate about the deep issues of our time, and how they impact our daily lives,” notes Lehrer. “Policies are derived through design solutions. We solve problems created over decades of planning that ignore how infrastructure can be integrated with positive outcomes. Our profession is critical in catalyzing change making tangible spaces and places that people can inhabit and relate to.”

Lehrer has made a career out of creating beautiful spaces that people want to exist in and know they belong in. It’s a common thread she weaves into her every day life and her desire to ensure that future generations of Latinx understand how pivotal their vision can be in creating the world we inhabit.

“ Within Latin American culture, there is a strong sense of family and multi-generational connectedness and creating networks,” explains Lehrer. “Spanish is my native tongue and there is a natural camaraderie on construction sites, in the halls of government buildings, and among environmental leaders. Being a Latina has provided me both with an outsider and insider view of the City of Los Angeles. I am from somewhere else however with such a strong Latino presence in the City I was able to engage in a deeper understanding of the issues facing a lot of the communities and facilitate communication between different groups.”

Below Lehrer expands on how she kickstarted her career, the advice she has for other Latinas, and what she’s learned by working on these larger landscape architecture jobs.

Vivian Nunez: How did you get your start?

Mia Lehrer: Hollywood treated me well. I moved to Los Angeles and was referred by one of my mentors to Ricardo Legoreta and went on to do work with the Legoreta team on wonderful projects and lucked up collaborations with some of the most wonderful directors, producers and actors. I learned a lot about pitching ideas, telling a story while understanding how to negotiate between sometimes contradicting points of view as well as building methods and budgets.

It soon became clear that the central American craftsmen who worked on the garden brought experience, passion and camaraderie to the production of these gardens. Sharing the making of these gardens is a highlight.

Nunez: How do you bring a project from ideation to implementation?

Lehrer: Our job is to provide the creativity, talent, skills, and business expertise to meet the client’s objectives as best as possible. We begin by teasing out the needs of the client followed by putting form to these ideas. We then ensure our designs are ecologically and hydrologically responsible as well as buildable. A great deal of time goes into drawing sets filled with detailed drawings of our design and we are there every step of the way to ensure that each tree that is planted and every bit of concrete that is poured reflects our design and meets our standards.

Nunez: What career steps led you to leading projects like the Dodger Stadium project?

Lehrer: Throughout my career I have focused on the Los Angeles region solving urban and landscape architecture problems in the megalopolis. Of course, we have done work in other regions and across the globe. Through this I was able to expand my repertoire and differing scales of projects. Los Angeles is a laboratory with all the possible ills of a burgeoning metropolis, in that way it provides a lot of opportunities for new solutions.

Nunez: What has been your biggest lesson learned in your career thus far?

Lehrer: Follow your passion and adhere to your value system; be willing to stand up for what you believe in, what that means, and how you operate within the built environment collaborating with colleagues.

Nunez: What advice do you have for Latinas who are looking to pursue careers that are anchored in their passions?

Lehrer: Stay focused. Find peers to generate synergy. Be patient. Hold onto your convictions. Look for mentors or create networks to feed your passion and your creative spirit.

Nunez: How do you manage both the design and business aspect of your job?

Lehrer: Business thinking and problem solving are inherent parts of what we do as designers.

That being said — it’s a juggling act. Connecting with interesting clients, cultivating interesting projects, working with the team to understand the realities of the business, be disciplined about the business enterprise, getting advice from colleagues and working with senior team members to make strategic decisions. I am a part of several professional, environmental and women’s organizations and those communities provide a rich platform for discussion.",
"Earlier this month, the qualifications of an African-American, female doctor, were questioned by the flight attendants on Delta Airlines, when she tried to help a fellow passenger who appeared unwell. Despite Dr. Cody Stanford being a doctor at Massachusetts General Hospital and an instructor at Harvard Medical School, with 10 years medical experience, her ethnicity or gender did not seem to match the attendants’ image of an M.D.

Cody Stanford was trying to take the lead in a situation in which she had significant experience but it seems that entrenched, traditional notions of leadership obstructed her.

On this particular Delta Airlines flight, the attachment to a misconception of what an M.D looks like, could have had serious personal consequences for Dr. Cody Stanford’s fellow passenger. Yet, female doctors of diverse ethnicities are hardly unusual in the US. It made me think of how many other professions are still predominantly white and male, and the recent criticism the BBC, in the UK, received for casting predominantly women in traditionally male roles, in its hugely successful drama ‘Bodyguard’.

The traditional descriptors of the traits of a leader are those you might associate with a bodyguard: decisive, bold and courageous. However, this heroic, male-defined model is increasingly challenged and not necessarily what the close protection industry needs. Only 5.4% of bodyguards are female, and demand for their services outstrips supply - another example of outdated notions of occupational competence disrupting the supply chain? It was a female close protection officer who, with a certain quietude, led the Duchess of Sussex out of an overcrowded Fijian market earlier this month, on the British royal couple’s first official overseas tour, after the Duchess apparently expressed her discomfort at the unexpectedly large crowds. Meghan Markel’s female head of security has been praised for her calm, effective and distinctly unmacho response to the situation.

It is precisely because the female bodyguard offers invisible security that, so often, makes them better suited to covert protection. They are more likely to possess the attributes, traditionally considered feminine, that are needed to work empathetically with their principal. Yet, when groups of trainee, close protection officers are shown crowd scenes and asked to identify the bodyguard, they invariably fail to identify the females. John Gerzema’s worldwide study of 64,000 people, published in his 2013 book ‘The Athena Doctrine’, challenges the traditional, masculine view of leadership, claiming that traditionally feminine values are now more needed than the masculine paradigm of the past. Yet bias, experienced first-hand by Dr Stanford, affects and limits the practice and ambition of female leaders every day.

Unlike the female bodyguard, whose lack of visibility proves to be an advantage, underrepresentation of women in senior positions in organisations suggests a different sort of invisibility – one that impedes women’s advancement and diminishes talent pools.",
"The inspiration for the SeaFlyer scooter came from what some may consider an odd place for an underwater device: an airplane.

""I looked out of the airplane window, seeing the clouds were floating backwards when the airplane moves. Suddenly, it came to my mind that since we can fly in the air with airplanes, why don’t we find a way to 'fly' in water?”

That epiphany happened to Yijun Chen, 29, who became a cofounder of BoyaGongdao Robot Technology Company, doing business as RoboSea. RoboSea's latest offering is the SeaFlyer, a scuba diver-inspired scooter that pulls swimmers through the water. It can dive to depths of 145 feet, well below the recommended maximum depth for the average open water scuba diver, and is held in front of the user with two hands. Its current crowdfunding price is $369, a price much lower than most scooters on the market that often cost $1,000 or more. The few underwater scooters available under $1,000 tend to be heavy and bulky, making them difficult to carry on vacations. Chen and her team wanted to make an alternative to those offerings, so their scooter weighs eight pounds and is about 20 inches long by six inches high.

Chen, along with cofounders, Xiong Mingle, 27, and Chen Longdong, 27, started RoboSea in 2015 in Beijing, China. The company has created a handful of robotics offerings, like an underwater fish-shaped camera drone that avoids scaring away actual fish, and a six-foot robotic shark that can track objects for professional and scientific research applications. The SeaFlyer is their first scooter and their second consumer-focused product.

Before developing the SeaFlyer, the RoboSea team studied other underwater crafts beyond dive scooters, like submersibles, bubble-shaped vehicles, and larger, professional propelling devices. They also spoke with users of those devices ranging from divers to lifeguards and researchers to figure out what features they felt were lacking in the current market offerings. Their in-house engineers then began the design and prototyping phase, which Chen categorizes into three categories: functionality, performance, and reliability. That included testing of different materials and shapes to ensure the SeaFlyer was perfectly buoyant, achieved when approximately one inch of the SeaFlyer was above the surface when let go. Chen says that while that process may not seem especially complicated it proved to be a challenge for the engineers, who solved the problem by including internal buoyancy compartments containing a mix of floating materials within the SeaFlyer frame.

In-water maneuverability wasn't the only challenge Chen’s team faced. Using the SeaFlyer in deep water requires a powerful battery, which generates heat — and unfortunately, that heat can age and strain the device's materials. So through a series of experiments and tests over several months, they created a new concept for the battery housing. The SeaFlyer now has a channel for water to flow across and cool the outside of the battery, which is divided into several different sections to ensure the electrodes within it are well protected from water. Between testing, materials, prototyping, research, permitting and more, RoboSea spent more than $1.2 million on research and development over a year-long period. The SeaFlyer was introduced to Indiegogo for crowdfunding in early October, where it reached its $30,000 funding goal in just over three days.

Chen credits some of that success to their video, made in partnership with a crowdfunding marketing and promotional agency. But she believes the SeaFlyer’s popularity can be explained primarily by its design features, which include a high-contrast OLED display screen to show statistics like depth and water temperature, universal controls, and a sleek, sports car-inspired look. “We developed a simple and beautiful structure in order to make underwater sports easier and let everyone feel an extraordinary experience,” she says. “We want the SeaFlyer to impact customers like a fancy gadget in a James Bond movie.""",
"November 11 was the celebration of Veterans Day in the United States, with a federal holiday being observed yesterday, November 12. Veterans Day is a holiday designed to honor military veterans and service members. Those who served made huge sacrifices to ensure the safety of the country and its inhabitants. Given the immense sacrifice that veterans have made for this country, it may come as a surprise that many who leave the service find themselves unable to find and secure a job. Several barriers to veteran employment have been identified:

Research indicates that some of the most common reasons why veterans leave their first jobs out of the service include lack of support in advancement and career development, lack of meaning in the work they are doing, few professional opportunities, and an unfamiliar work culture. How can organizations overcome these barriers, create an environment that treats veterans in an equitable manner, and retains veteran employees?

In order to foster an inclusive environment for veterans, organizations should first provide training about bias and stereotypes of veterans. Understanding and being aware of the unconscious and conscious biases that we each have can help to minimize our bias. Establishing Employee Resource Groups for veterans within your company can provide veteran employees with support and allow them to connect with other veterans in the organization. This is particularly important if your workplace consists of a number of veteran employees.

There has to be a job skills translation to help employers better comprehend how the skills and abilities of the job candidate are able to translate into the current roles they are seeking. The skills that veterans gained while serving may not (on the surface) appear to be skills that are needed in the jobs they are applying for. The military helps individuals gain many general skills but sometimes for job roles, very specific skills are necessary. Being able to assess how the candidate’s previous experience and background align with the requirements of the current role will help employers assess candidate fit more effectively. It may also prove beneficial to help educate managers and supervisors on military jargon and language. Having an understanding of military terminology will help employers during the hiring process to access the veteran candidate better and identify their strengths, skills, and expertise.

Organizations that consist of a high percentage of veteran employees should also look into developing training programs to help veteran employees better acclimate themselves to the civilian workplace. Veterans may not be as adequately prepared for civilian work when they leave the service, but providing additional training and support for veteran employees can increase veteran retention.

Another piece of the puzzle to hire and retain more veteran employees is educating veterans on strategies to make themselves more marketable and increase their likelihood of being hired. What can veterans do to increase employment opportunities for themselves?

Veterans are hard-working, motivated, and tenacious. Organizations are missing out on a valuable segment of the population when they overlook veteran candidates. With the skills gap costing companies over a million dollars, employers must find ways to recruit and retain talent and making a concerted effort to hire veterans could provide great benefits to any organization.",None
"Entrepreneurship is a constant process of trial and error. However, too much error may lead to significant pitfalls, or even failure. About 50% of small businesses fail in their first four years, according to data compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Main causes of failure included incompetence and lack of experience.

While trial and error is certainly always involved, some errors are clearly more costly than others. So, what are the best ways for aspiring entrepreneurs to avoid such painful pitfalls when starting their business, especially in markets where competition is especially fierce? Below, 12 members of Forbes New York Business Council provide their best ways to avoid potential pitfalls while starting out.

Warren Buffett only invests in a business if it's a long-term strategy. I'm shocked to see how many people start a business with one foot out the door. You need to jump in with two feet. If you want to become a successful entrepreneur, it needs to be a long-term investment and you need a do-not-quit attitude. Failure is OK, as long as you fail fast and pivot to get back on the road to success. – Philip Smith, PJP Marketing, Inc.

Remember that competition is a good thing. Pay attention to what your competitors are doing and find ways to elevate your offering that resonates with your core values. Do the best you can to find the balance between maintaining focus on your business and staying ahead of trends. I guess that means to consistently check your ego and don’t get caught up in the hype. – Morris Levy, The Yard

3. Hire The Best Advisors You Can Afford

When it comes to setting the foundation for your new business, it makes sense to establish proper fundamentals from the onset. This is why I believe it's imperative to hire the best accountant and business attorney to fit your budget. Doing things correctly from the start establishes a solid foundation to build upon and you'll avoid the headaches of having to restructure later. – Denise Caron-Quinn, In Order to Succeed®

4. Look On It As An Experience

While there is not really a way to avoid failure, you can take the failure as a learning experience. After every failure, think to yourself ""What did I learn from this experience?"" Go put a strategy in place so it doesn't happen again. – Henry Landau, First Health Pro

5. Start With The End In Mind

It's easy to get so caught up in the day to day that you pick your head up and realize you are working constantly in the business and not on the business. Starting with the end in mind helps you create systems and processes to be replicated by people who work with you later. Going from a one-man show to a team is a difficult transition as you grow, but made much easier by planning properly. – Steven Libman, Integrity Holdings Group, LLC

We all have a million ideas. Unfortunately, most of them are terrible. We can believe in something to the depth of our soul, but if there is not a market for this idea, the belief needs to change. When building a business, do not let emotion or conviction drive your strategy — hubris and ego, when not offset by the humility of data, can drive you right off a cliff. Look to the numbers. – Monica Ferguson, SoleMates, LLC

Don't quit your day job right away. Use it to propel you to the next level. Start small. If you are selling a product, do it online. If you are selling a service, do it on the nights and weekends. Find out if it's a viable business move or just a passion project/hobby. – James Giacopelli, Giac Capital, Inc & Giacopelli Accounting and Tax Services, LLC

There are numerous things that can go wrong when you start a business. Worry less about how to avoid them, and more about how to tackle challenges with a positive mindset. There will be some failures, but it will be easier if you can face a few challenges early on that teach you how to grow and pivot. – Ludovic Huraux, Shapr

9. Go With Your Gut

It's not possible to avoid every failure or bad decision, no matter how much planning or effort is put into it. Go with your gut! Pick yourself up, dust yourself off and keep it moving. Growth happens in those moments where we make the wrong choice or bad decision. Embrace the learning process. All true successes are backed by a laundry list of failures. – Hoda Mahmoodzadegan, Molly's Milk Truck and F'in Delicious Beverages

10. Be True To Yourself

My advice would be to say no if a project or client doesn't feel right. Early on in starting a business, you'll take any project or client willing to pay you money. And to some extent, it's a necessary evil of starting out. But be careful. Promising to deliver something way outside of your expertise can get you into some extremely uncomfortable situations and potentially damage your reputation. – Tom Conlon, North Street

11. Make Sure Someone Has Your Back

It is imperative to have a strong network of advisors and mentors in your corner. Nobody is expected to know everything, even when it is your business. Having an advisory team in place will allow you to make good decisions even in rocky waters. We are very lucky to have met a great group of entrepreneurs and finance experts through our time in Startup Bootcamp and Silvertech Ventures. – Yana Zaidiner, Token Payments, Inc.

We all have ideas of how to solve problems and make the world a better place. One mistake is to overly focus on a business idea that you would be a customer of. The pitfall is not focusing on the daily tasks that will become your new life. To avoid this, ask yourself if you are excited about the daily execution. If you love the journey, your passion will shine and business will endure. – Jonathan Amoia, Sandhill Investment Management",
"The holiday season can be the most profitable time of year for businesses. Consumers are in the shopping mood and ready to spend money. But if you want to grab their attention, you're going to have to step up your game.

Consumers today are no longer limited to brick-and-mortar shops in their area. Shoppers can browse stores straight from their mobile phones, including on social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram. In fact, 49 percent of global surveyed shoppers say Facebook is influential in their holiday shopping.

So, if you want to attract more festive shoppers and boost sales, here's how to get the most out of Facebook advertising this season.

Determining who you're going to target with your holiday Facebook ads will give your ads more focus and make them more effective overall. While a broad holiday ad will grab the attention of some users, ads that are highly specific to each segment of your audience will produce higher conversions.

Do you want to target your existing customers? Target new customers? Reach out to moms to drive more sales to your children's products? Before you start advertising on Facebook, decide who you'll be speaking to and what messages and images will resonate with them.

With so many holiday sales happening in the same period, it can be tempting to promote them all at once, but don't lump all of the seasonal holidays into one Facebook ad. For instance, Black Friday and Cyber Monday are sometimes thrown together, but each event should have its own unique ads.

Even if you're promoting similar offers, changing your copy to represent each sales event is key to getting more conversions. When users see an ad that says ""Crazy Holiday Deals,"" they might wonder what holiday and when. But if your ad says ""Crazy Black Friday Deals,"" users know exactly what you're talking about and it creates a sense of urgency.

Facebook offers a number of dynamic ad formats. Depending on what you want to accomplish with your seasonal Facebook ad campaign, the type of ad format you choose will vary. Some of the most effective ad formats to showcase your products this season include:

Add a little festive flair to your Facebook ad copy in order to attract holiday shoppers who are in the mood to spend. Not only do you want to create a feeling of holiday cheer that they can associate with your brand, but you also want to give them another use case for your product.

For instance, instead of just promoting headphones by emphasizing their great sound quality, add in that they would make a great stocking stuffer for teens.

"Harry Potter. You can be a muggle who has never seen the films or read the books but still know the character reference and the pop culture impact of the reportedly $25 billion dollar franchise. When J.K Rowling penned ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"" in 1995, she had no idea the successful business woman she would become or the generational impact the series would have.

As fans gather in theaters this week for the latest of the Potter Franchise Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, we take the time to look back at the series and the lessons on leadership, teamwork, and personal accountability.

As leaders, it's important that we understand the value of transparency and honest feedback. Cultivating an environment where employees feel their voice is heard and where progress can be reported openly is critical to success. While the truth may not be easy, it is in treating it with caution and respect that allows employees to hold themselves accountable for results―and ultimately organizational success.

Like Dumbledore, you may recognize the importance of choices and accountability in general―but incorporating the right ones into your day-to-day actions is another thing. We argue that The Oz Principle's definition of accountability empowers you to take those right steps. We define it as, ""a personal choice to rise above one's circumstances and demonstrate the ownership necessary for achieving desired results.""

Leaders, no matter their years of experience, face daily fears while running a business. Those who succeed in overcoming their fears recognize them as just that―fears. While leaders may not have a spell as Harry does with his Boggart, they can manage their fears by learning how to intentionally shape their workplace culture to achieve results.

No matter who your employees are beyond the workplace door, when leaders cultivate a culture with a common language, set measurable goals, and empower their employees to invest in them, no result is unattainable.

Getting everyone on board and securing employee buy in for an organization's direction, goals, and results is no easy feat, but critical for strong leadership. Groundbreaking results happen when every individual in an organization is aligned around a purpose and clear on what the priorities and outcomes are.

No truer words have been said. There might be days when you want to throw in the towel and give up. But giving up doesn't make us feel better. It makes us feel stuck. Try this instead: take ownership of results, even if that requires you to accept your failures. This simple mind shift allows you to rise above circumstances and puts you on the path towards achieving desired results.

When individuals in organizations disengage and stop communicating with those around them, the damage is two-fold. Not only are results not realized, but individuals slip from apathetic to resentful. And this toxic culture has a negative impact on the rest of the team. Leaders can prevent this by continuing to have open lines of communication and empower their team to provide feedback.

Leaders sometimes find themselves in tricky situations where they have to take calculated risks―which could lead to failure. The problem with losing your nerve and becoming risk-aversive is leaders endanger their professional aspirations and the organization at large. Without risk, individuals and organizations alike lose opportunities to innovate and find creative solutions when challenges arise. A little nerve can go a long way to making impactful things happen.",
"The skilled labor shortage is affecting companies all over the world. According to the latest Manpower ""Talent Shortage Survey"" 44% of employers across the globe report they cannot find the skills they need.

The German Economic Institute recently calculated that the lack of skilled labor -- estimated at 440,000 qualified workers -- is costing the German economy 30 billion euros a year in GDP growth (0.9 percentage points to be exact).

Business leaders are reacting in several standard ways: recruiting hard for the few candidates who are out there, offering higher pay and benefits to attract and retain them, and investing in learning and development programs to increase the skills of current employees.

But there's another approach organizations need to consider: Stop making management positions a reward for exceptionally skilled labor.

Top two reasons for the promotion to manager:

When companies promote a worker to management on the basis of prior performance, they lose a job expert and obtain a manager who often times has no talent for people management. That's how moving a single person can create a double negative -- and it hurts the business.

A better plan is a redesign of the company's career path and promotion system.

Allowing job role experts to advance inside their roles keeps great workers doing their great work and keeps management in the hands of people with the ability to do it well.

The current system is simple: The only way for exceptional performers to advance in their careers is to take on people management responsibilities.

While this system offers workers a clear, defined advancement path, the negative effects are reflected in both the shortage of skilled labor and the terrible state of people management across the world -- highlighted by a 15% global employee engagement rate.

Indeed, Gallup finds that 70% of the variance in engagement can be attributed to the direct manager and only 30% to organizational structures and processes.

There are alternative ways to build career paths: Gallup's best practice advice is to create additional paths for skill roles that parallel the manager path. These paths reward achievement with advancement inside a role, rather than with a move to a management position.

This is how it works: As people become better at their jobs, their pay and -- equally importantly -- their status and responsibilities increase.

This approach allows the talented and skilled to develop excellence in one role instead of switching roles for the sole purpose of advancing in the company.

In addition, pay structure is shifted to a broad-banding system, where the entry pay for a higher-level role is less than the top-end pay of a lower-level role, e.g., the expert salesman earns more than the new sales manager.

Such a system indicates that the business puts financial value on excellent performance and recognizes developmental achievements, too.

Naturally, that changes a company's management promotion system. And while it keeps skilled labor in skilled positions, it does force companies to reckon with this issue: how to select managers if prior role success isn't the key criterion.

Gallup has done extensive research into what predicts management excellence and has found five innate talents -- i.e., natural capacity for excellence -- best predict a manager's success:

There's no reason that a high-performing individual contributor can't have these qualities. But there's also no reason to assume she does, simply because she's been so successful in her current role.

Companies that value performance must value potential -- and discover how to develop it on an individual basis.

When companies select for talent in a position rather than using managerial positions as a reward, everyone wins.

Indeed, our research shows that managers selected because of their exceptional managerial talents realized significantly better business outcomes: an increase in profit of 48%, an increase in employee engagement of 17% and an increase in productivity of 22%.

And people are more likely to be engaged in their work and less likely to leave a company if they can use their strengths in a role.

The opportunity is clear: Better careers paths and a new manager selection system allow organizations to greatly improve their internal allocation of human resources.

But the ongoing need is also clear; Businesses can't succeed without skilled workers.

Competition for them is fierce, and hiring them is costly.

Keeping talented workers where they shine -- and that goes for managers, too -- is a winning strategy for people, companies and the economy.

Hire skilled workers into the right roles and develop their natural talents:",coaching
"Saturday, November 24, is Small Business Saturday, a day dedicated to supporting small businesses. In the U.S. alone there are 28 million small businesses with a staggering 120 million people employed by small businesses. There are several lessons that can be learned from small businesses about how to make companies more diverse and inclusive. One small business that is setting a great example is Savoir Faire. As one of the few black-owned fragrance brands, the company has utilized inclusive products, marketing, and branding, as well as strategic partnerships to successfully sell products. The motto behind the fragrance is “exclusive inclusion” and the company “celebrates the unique individual ability that you have which allows you to thrive in various social circles regardless of skin color, religion, education, or crypto portfolio.” The company demonstrates this motto by their actions. Through honesty, transparency, and consistency as well as word of mouth, Savoir Faire has developed a successful brand with loyal customers. What can companies, small and large, learn from Savoir Faire, in order to foster a culture of inclusion?

1. Inclusive products. Savoir Faire is a fragrance that can be used for both men and women. Rather than creating a product for a very specific segment of the population, the fragrance was designed to be unisex. Research supports the benefits of creating inclusive products. One survey found that designing products for a larger segment of the population improved customer experience and product quality and had a positive impact on market share and revenue. Companies should consider creating products that appeal to a wider audience rather than a smaller subset of the population. Not only will more inclusive products have a positive impact on the company’s bottom line, but inclusive products better the customer’s experience.

2. Inclusive marketing. Part of the success of Savoir Faire lies in their inclusive marketing. Savoir Faire owner, Chris ‘Classic’ Davis indicated, “I market to all types of potential customers…empowering women and creatives as a whole.” Consumers want to see more representation through marketing and advertising. Beauty brand, Fenty Beauty, has seen remarkable success by employing an inclusive marketing strategy that features women of a variety of skin tones wearing the makeup. If the success of movies like Black Panther and Crazy Rich Asians is any indication, consumers value and appreciate seeing representation. Companies that use inclusive marketing have often experienced increased sales and revenue. Re-evaluate your marketing and advertising strategies. Some important questions to ask include: who is represented in your ads? Are your products inclusive to different demographics? How can you re-pivot your focus on developing products and services that appeal to a wider audience?

3. Inclusive branding. The logo design for Savoir Faire is a hand-drawn crown. “It represents the individual and personal standard of excellence you hold yourself to…it’s imperfect, yet still regal,” Davis explains. The logo for Savoir Faire experienced a surprise surge of popularity after the design went viral. In January 2018, Davis photoshopped the Savoir Faire logo design over an H&M ad that had been criticized for being racist; the photoshopped edit Davis created went viral. Davis’ strategy to use the Savoir Faire logo design to change the narrative of a negative image to one that is inclusive and empowering was an effective method that was met with positive reception on social media. Finding ways to create a brand that is inclusive will produce positive returns for the organization.

4. Strategic partnerships. Savoir Faire utilizes strategic partnerships to strengthen the business and promote other black-owned business. Davis has partnered with other black-owned business in several large cities to host pop-up events, where consumers can come in, patronize the shop and purchase the Savoir Faire fragrance. Savoir Faire does not have a traditional brick and mortar location and sells products through an online store, so strategic partnerships are mutually beneficial for the company. With the reported disparities in funding for White versus non-white business owners, strategic partnerships are one way to level the playing field. Companies can utilize strategic partnerships with other organizations to help them reach their strategic goals, gain growth in new markets, and exchange knowledge and information with other business owners.

There are many lessons that corporations can learn from small businesses. By developing inclusive products for a wide range of customers, utilizing inclusive marketing strategies, incorporating inclusive branding and creating strategic alliances with other businesses, organizations can help foster a culture of inclusion for all.",
"In my 18-year corporate career, I witnessed firsthand the power of teamwork – how working collaboratively with an accomplished and diverse group that is in harmonious alignment with the team's goals and desired outcomes could move mountains and achieve truly great things together. I also experienced the opposite – people desperately straining to stand out, to take credit where it was not due, and to thwart the team's work so they could somehow rise to the top. That rarely worked for them. Usually, the selfish maverick who hogged all the attention and didn't collaborate was found out and pushed out.

It's important to note, though, that it can be damaging for one's career, particularly for women in male-dominated environments, if they shy away from shining their own light, and from taking credit where credit is truly due. This is a common challenge that holds women back from advancement to leadership and earning the recognition they deserve. Overall, it's a fine balance to strike in our careers – how to be a great team player while also standing out as a key contributor.

To learn more about what great team work is and how to become a consummate team player, I was excited to catch up with Tom Murry for his take. Murry is the retired CEO of Calvin Klein, where he ran the company for 17 years and facilitated the brand’s growth from 2.8 billion to almost $8 billion in retail sales. Prior to that, he spent the majority of his career working for iconic fashion brands (including Elie Tahari and Evan-Picone) and rising through the ranks to what he considers ""the greatest job in the world,"" working alongside designer extraordinaire Calvin Klein. Murry is the author of the forthcoming A Great Fit: Finding the Work That Suits You Best.

Kathy Caprino: Tom, you say that you have a “sixth sense” in identifying team players. What in your past work and life experiences has contributed to your ability to identify team players?

Tom Murry: I learned the importance of individual performance for the benefit of the entire team way back when I was a wrestler in high school. If I didn’t give my all and do all the training and work prior to getting to the mat, I would let my teammates down and they wouldn’t get the points they needed to win. And I learned from a young age how to carry my own weight. After I could no longer participate in wrestling, I pursued another passion of mine: music. I didn’t know it then, but I can say with certitude after 40 years of business experience, being in a band is just like business. In both music and business, you have to give people what they want. (And yes, sometimes people don’t know what they want until they’ve experienced it!).

Nevertheless, what the customer wants trumps all. And in order to give customers what they want, you have to come together to make it happen . Every instrument and every player counts. To create anything great — whether it’s a song or a suit — requires more than raw talent and passion, too. It requires impeccable timing, knowing when to give more, and when to hang back and let someone else shine. I learned all that before I stepped foot in an office.

Caprino: How important is it to the success of one’s career to learn how to become team-oriented?

Murry: I would go out on a limb here and say it’s the most important skill to have to be successful. You can’t get anywhere in life — or in business — alone. And the sooner you recognize that, the happier and more successful you’ll be. It requires a certain level of humility to admit you can’t do everything alone. And you know what’s even more difficult to admit? That others can do something better you. I think what makes the best leaders are those that recognize there are more talented, experienced, capable, and smarter people in a room than them — and they have the good sense to hire and then listen to them.

Even if you’re not a leader, you have to admit others are better than you. Then you have to be willing to pitch in, give, learn, step back, step up, and grow. I wasn’t always the leader of Calvin Klein, but what got me there and what kept me there for 17 years was knowing how to be a contributing member of a team.

Caprino:  I'm guessing you've received some pushback on your messages about focusing on being a team player from people who believe that a “win at all-cost"" mentality helps them succeed in the workplace. How can a professional reconcile being a great team player and while striving to stand out to advance his or her career?

Murry: I have been known to say: “It’s all about winning; otherwise, you’re wasting your time.” I firmly believe wanting to win and being a team player are not mutually exclusive. I believe when you show up at work, you have one job: to be successful. To win, if you will. If you’re not showing up every day to win, to do your best, to succeed, and to come out more profitable or ahead, then you’re wasting your time and everyone else’s.

The workplace is not a place for mediocrity or settling. Working with Calvin and his entire design team taught me the importance of excellence, striving for perfection, and not giving up until things were as great as they could possibly be. The key word here though is TEAM. We succeeded and won as a team. If you’re doing it right, everyone has a chance to shine and show his or her own abilities. You don’t want to compete with others within in your organization, you want to compete with yourself.

Ask yourself every day:

Am I doing my best?

Am I helping advance the mission of my organization?

Am I carrying my own weight?

Am I bringing my own unique skills and talents to the office?

If the answer is ""yes"" to all the above, I assure you you will stand out to your team members and the leaders. And don’t worry about getting credit for what you did on a daily basis. Personally, I don’t like people who take credit for everything. And it’s safe to say most of us hate it when friends or coworkers steal all the spotlight or don’t share the credit.

If you want to endear yourself to others, shine a light on the achievements of your coworkers, your colleagues, or your employees. The more you demonstrate that you’re not out there trying to get ahead of everyone else, the more you’re likely to get ahead anyway.

Caprino: What are some helpful steps for those who are struggling to fit in in a team-oriented environment? What can they do?

Murry: I recommend doing a quick self-assessment. The most basic and fundamental question you should ask yourself and answer honestly is: ""Am I capable of doing this work?"" In other words, are you competent?

I've seen people talk a big game, but the reason they need to talk themselves up so much is they don’t know what they’re doing. If you can’t carry your own weight or you are in over your head, there is no shame in asking for help. You do no one any favors pretending to know something you don’t.

Another thing I advise is asking yourself is: ""Am I complaining too much?"" I have found those who have time to complain are rarely doing their fair share of the work. Busy, engaged, and passionate people don’t have time to complain or compare notes on who is getting what from whom. If you’re competent, not complaining, doing your best, and you still don’t feel like you fit in, then my suggestion is to ask yourself if this is the right company for you. It’s okay if it’s not. No one wins if an employee is unhappy. Find a place where your purpose, passion, and competency align and I assure you, you’ll be a great fit.

Caprino: What have you found to be the three most essential behaviors a person can take to become a well-respected, highly-beneficial team player?

Murry: Here are my top three recommended strategies for becoming a consummate team player:

Don’t get too hung up on the way things ""should"" be done.

You have to be flexible if you’re part of a team. If you’re in any group, you can’t assume every single person is going to want to do things exactly your way. You have to be adaptable and have an open mind. You might even learn a better way to do things if you let others show you how they do it.

A true team player is not threatened by others’ achievements and success. You regularly celebrate team members when they do something well. You’re genuinely happy for them — because you know that their success means the entire team’s success. I believe the best way to succeed in business is by helping others succeed.

It’s so basic, but it is so powerful. Be nice to people. Say ""please"" and ""thank you."" Ask people how they are doing. Offer your ideas and time. Be grateful and appreciative when others help. Be honest when you fail or don’t know something. Don’t make excuses. Don’t overstate your achievements. Don’t overpromise and under-deliver. Simply tell people what you’re going to do, and then do it — kindly and generously.

"For Yael Averbuch, the outspoken president of the National Women's Soccer League Players Association, Thursday's announcement that the league had recognized the NWSLPA as the exclusive bargaining entity represented less of a pathway toward a specific outcome—say, a collective bargaining agreement, or a particular improvement in the working conditions of the players—and more a gesture of good faith that will allow players and league alike to work toward building a better future for professional women's soccer in the United States.

""Our biggest goal is to continue on the path of a collaborative relationship with the League,"" Averbuch told me in an email shortly after the announcement. ""While we do have areas we'd like to address and aim to continue to solidify our internal communication and support for our players, we remain cognizant of the fact that all entities of our League are working hard and sacrificing to continue the progress of the League. So our biggest aim is to aid in that progress, rather than ever proving to be an additional obstacle or barrier to it.""

The parallel tracks of the NWSLPA and the NWSL are unmistakable, and Averbuch defines it in a way that makes plain both the progress and the recognition of how far both groups need to go.

So no, there won't be any soccer equivalent of the WNBPA's decision earlier this month to opt out of its CBA. Indeed, at least for now, there isn't a CBA to speak of, as it relates to the players in the NWSL who aren't with the national team. (Those players are represented by a separate entity, the USWNTPA, and are paid by U.S. Soccer and then allocated to NWSL teams.)

""As of now we do not plan to immediately pursue a CBA and don't have a specific timeframe for this,"" Averbuch said via email. ""Our aim is to not put any undue time or financial burdens on the league as we move forward, so that is our main focus as we continue our collaborative relationship.""

There are numerous reasons that collaboration matters, but let's use Sky Blue FC as a particular example of importance. Over the past few years, Sky Blue players have been extremely unhappy with their working conditions, and with very good reason. Notably, when Carli Lloyd, the legendary national team player, spoke out about this at the conclusion of the NWSL season, she pointed out that in many ways, her experience was separate from those on the team who aren't allocated players.

So prior to Thursday's announcement, those players really didn't have a streamlined way to register their complaints. Anything brought to the team simply didn't require a response, nor did it necessarily lead to additional pressure brought to bear from the league. Only leaking to the press led to any real change in the dynamic, and that lasts only as long as the team feels any pressure from it—a limited avenue for change in a league that still suffers from a scarcity of full-time media members who can spotlight important stories on a daily basis.

But now there is a group in place for precisely this kind of advocacy. That's huge, particularly in a league still searching for a new commissioner.

""We have a great working relationship with the USWNTPA, and they have been very supportive of us,"" Averbuch said. ""While we collaborate on shared concerns, workplace issues and benefits are dealt with completely separately with our individual employers (US Soccer for the USWNTPA and NWSL for the NWSLPA). Obviously, any issues affecting all players in the league are a joint concern and are addressed by us both in our communication with the League.""

With the 2019 NWSL Draft now just a few weeks away (January 10, 2019—mark your calendars), it also means that at the moment the best and brightest new talents enter the professional ranks, there is an authorized, recognized and organized group around to help integrate them into what is a difficult transition for anyone entering the workforce, let alone those doing it in the highly pressurized environment of pro soccer, making an improved but still insufficient wage to avoid things like second jobs—minimum salaries were $15,750 in 2018; maximums for non-national team players checked in at $44,000.

There's value in that, not just for the players, but for the league as well.

""Our decision to voluntarily recognize the NWSL Players Association as the official representative of NWSL players marks an important step in the continued growth and development of the league and our relationship with our players,"" NWSL Managing Director Amanda Duffy said in a press release. ""We look forward to collaborating with the Players Association as the league continues to mature, to benefit the players, teams, our partners and our fans.""

The collaboration itself is aspirational in many ways. But the recognition of the NWSLPA brings it one step closer to reality.",None
"Day 14: Learn to navigate conflict. This post is part of Forbes’ Career Challenge: Build Stronger Relationships In 15 Days.

Conflict is part of life. Most of us avoid conflict when we can, but sometimes, it’s unavoidable. Early in our careers, when we feel powerless relative to those around us, we tend to deal with conflict by ducking, dodging or deferring, knowing that we don’t have much leverage to push back. But as we progress in our careers, we gain clout, credibility and control, and our approach evolves. How can we handle conflict more effectively, regardless of where we are on the seniority spectrum?

Let’s start by defining terms. For the purposes of this piece, “conflict” means a situation where two or more people believe strongly in differing paths and a certain stubbornness or lack of trust has set in. I refer to “navigating” conflict rather than “resolving” or “eliminating” conflict in the workplace because we can’t fix everything. Knowing that we need to find our way through the challenges of the day sets us up for success when conflicts arise. Thinking that we need to fix everything sets us up for failure.

Here are some basic elements for navigating work-based conflicts.

1. Pick your battles. As a baseline, decide if you’re part of a particular conflict. If you’re not, stay out of the way. You may view your personal brand as “peacemaker” and feel a strong impulse to weigh in on challenging situations. You may quickly discover your brand is actually “buttinsky” and may create even more tension.

Assuming you have a role in resolving the conflict, decide on timing and approach. Has the conflict risen to the level that you need to get involved? Some challenges between two people who report to you need to be worked out by those individuals. If those people resolve the challenge on their own, they’ve grown from the experience. Your involvement would have kept them dependent on you for solutions. Deciding not to take action is sometimes a valid decision, since some problems can be resolved without you.

2. Avoid making assumptions. There’s a basic principle about faulty decision-making called “What you see is all there is.” Our natural instinct is to assume what we have in front of us is everything, and to trust whoever is presenting the information. Assume instead that every picture you are looking at is a jigsaw puzzle and that a few dozen pieces are missing. Even though you can tell it’s a picture of a lake in the mountains, you should recognize that you’re missing enough pieces that there is important information you can’t determine yet. Is there a cabin on the shore? A moose coming through the trees? When someone presents you with a conflict he has with a co-worker, or you have your own disagreement with a colleague, start by asking a few basic questions.

What else is important for me to know?

This first question helps you uncover information. It shows interest on your part and creates the expectation on the part of the other person that you are going to investigate the issue, starting immediately. It also positions you as thoughtful and reflective, rather than impulsive and reactive. That’s an impressive sign of growth to those around you.

If the other person were here, what would he be telling me?

If you’re a manager asking this question of someone who is in your presence raising an issue, your response forces your colleague to articulate the other person’s position. We all appreciate that there are two or more sides to every story. However, when we articulate those alternative arguments ourselves, we become more sympathetic to the other person’s perspective, which often starts to take the edge off the conflict.

If you are a party to the conflict, before speaking with a manager, ask yourself, “What don’t I know about the person’s motivation, intention, reasoning and feelings about the topic at hand?” Then, go to the other person and ask the appropriate questions. Doing so shows that you are working very diligently to understand the other person in the conversation, and goes a long way to build trust.

What are you asking me to do?

Depending on your management style, you might assume when someone comes to you with an issue that they want you to dive in and solve the problem. Sometimes they do. Ask this third question to reinforce that you won’t be making any sudden judgements and will be reasoned in your approach.

If they respond by saying, “I just need guidance” or “I just needed a sounding board,” you’ve avoided spending time jumping in when your participation wasn’t welcome.

What if you’re the more junior person in the discussion? It’s not politically palatable or comfortable for you to say, “I need you to act differently toward me.” Instead, phrase your request from the perspective of how it will help the other person. “I want to make sure I’m doing a good job for you. I’ll be better able to do that if we can take more time when you are giving me direction.” By framing your request as a means to an end that serves the other person, you’re more likely to state your position calmly and professionally, and are more likely to be heard by the other person.

Each of these questions should be asked with a completely neutral tone, not one that shows exasperation or frustration. Asking these questions will not only help you understand the other person’s perspective, but will help you develop better leadership traits.

3. Investigate. If there is an independent source of information available that gives color to the conflict, access it before you speak to the other party involved. You may then have other questions for the person who came to you or with whom you have a conflict. The answers to those questions will help you understand their perspective.

4. Listen to the other side. If you are a manager, let’s assume the person coming to you with a problem wants you to take an active role in fixing it. Contact the other person involved and ask to meet with them. Tell them the agenda so that they aren’t blindsided when they meet with you. If possible, meet with the person face-to-face. Start with a pleasant tone and ask a few straightforward questions that have nothing to do with the issue at hand, possibly commenting on something else with which the person is involved. A simple, “How is your day going?” or “How are things coming along on the X project?” emphasizes that the challenge you two are about to discuss is only one element in the person’s larger workday. It keeps the immediate challenge in perspective. Ending the conversation the same way, by commenting on another aspect of work, reinforces that message.

Fairly quickly, however, you should get to the point of the meeting. “Jack shared with me that an issue arose regarding Z. What’s your take on the situation?” Be prepared to ask lots of questions. Don’t rush the conversation, which means you have to set aside ample time for the meeting. Again, you’ll maintain a neutral demeanor and not telegraph from your facial expressions or tone of voice that you are siding with one party or the other.

If you are a party to the conflict and you’re ready to address this issue with someone else, the same technique works. Starting with a more innocuous topic emphasizes that your relationship with this person isn’t all tension.

5. Decide on next steps. This is where it gets tricky. Determine if this is the type of issue that requires all parties to sit down and hash out the problem. Most of the time, getting everyone in the room together is the best course of action, as it forces open discussion.

If that meeting takes place, you again need to decide on your role: Are you moderating a discussion, mediating a dispute or ultimately making a decision? If you are moderating, your job is to keep the conversation open, focused and civil. If you are mediating, the parties involved will ultimately decide how they move forward on a project. If you are making the decision, depending on the complexity of the issue, either tell them your decision right then, or tell them you need some time to reflect on it or do some research. If you delay the decision, don’t delay long. They need to move things forward.

Obviously, there are lots of intricacies in dealing with conflict. I haven’t even commented on dealing with the emotional dimension of how people process ideas and information when they are facing a challenge. These are just some first steps to consider when having those tough conversations.

"It's rather unfortunate that much of the dialogue around the future of work has been on the number of jobs that will be lost and so on. It's a narrative that doesn't really provide an accurate reflection of the true state of things (a recent paper from the Turing Centre provides a good overview).

After the hyperbole around the topic has subsided a little however, there is a growing consensus that AI-driven technology will change the kind of work we do, which will require adaptation both of the roles themselves and the skills required to perform them.  It will automate some entirely (although not as many as predicted), and the productivity gains will result in new jobs emerging.

It's difficult to go too far down this path without getting into the realm of science fiction, but one of the more grounded attempts at doing so comes via a recent report from consultancy firm Cognizant, who have suggested 21 jobs that might emerge in the coming years.

The report has orientated the jobs they propose around the two axes of tech-centricity and time. They've endeavored to create a mixture of high-tech and low-tech jobs, with some beginning to appear in the marketplace already and some a distant spot on the horizon.

Cognizant have form in this area, and published a similar paper last year, in which they suggested that jobs of the future will revolve around coaching, caring and connecting. This underlined the importance we place on the human touch. In this latest report, they again tap into the deep seams of human emotions to find new bedrocks for this new wave of jobs.

They argue that ethics will play a huge role, both in ensuring that machines behave in a way we're happy with, and the organizations we work for. They propose jobs such as Algorithm Bias Auditor and Head of Machine Personality Design.

They also believe that security will remain a huge issue in the future, and therefore roles such as Cyber Attack Agent and Machine Risk Officer will potentially come to the fore.

Lastly, they believe that new jobs will emerge that are very aspirational in nature and help us to bring our high-tech dreams into reality. These might include Vertical Farm Consultant and Smart Home Designer.

Suffice to say, some of the roles identified by Cognizant require very different skills than those commonly used in the labor market today.  Perhaps the best lesson to take away from the report however is that such is the pace of change in the workplace that skills are now akin to mobile apps, which require constant upgrades to ensure they're viable.

To date, we largely still operate in an environment where a big investment in training is followed by a long period where that knowledge is commercially exploited.  It's a landscape that is no longer really fit for purpose, and whilst there have been steps in the right direction, much more needs to be done, not least in engaging with people that aren't currently engaged in adult education, or who aren't in traditional forms of employment where their employer can support them.

There are numerous issues that underpin the fear many feel at this rapid pace of change, and indeed that fear has been successfully tapped into by the various doomsday scenarios about our future of technology.  It's perhaps no surprise that many of these scenarios provoke a proverbial smashing of the looms to hold back the march of technology, and therefore half our own need to change.

Whether as organizations or individuals, there is a longstanding difficulty in adapting to change.  Whereas markets are structured so that those who don't adapt eventually die off, we cannot accept such an outcome for the individuals among us who struggle to adapt.  As such, we need to do much better at preventing such an outcome from occurring.  It perhaps goes without saying that this isn't one of the roles Cognizant imagine in their report, but perhaps it's the most crucial one of all.

To keep track of the progress of these proposed jobs, Cognizant have created a Jobs of the Future Index, which will monitor the emergence of the predicted jobs from both 2018 and 2017 Jobs of the Future reports by the company.  It's fairly rare for a company to hold their predictions to account in such a way, so that is certainly admirable, and it will be interesting to see whether their predictions find their way into the labor market in any meaningful way in the coming years.",
"We’re taught from a young age to “play nice” if we don’t want to find ourselves in trouble. Being “nice” is a huge part of our upbringing and vocabulary. As we grow older, these early messages can turn into unconscious scripts that impact our personal and professional lives.

The early childhood message to “play nice” is especially apparent in our relationships with others. It is often louder than the call for us to be assertive, set healthy boundaries, or even prioritize our own needs over the needs of others.

But how nice should a leader be? If you’re too nice you risk being a pushover; you might keep an employee beyond their expiration date; you might see deadlines come and go; you might become too close with your employees at the expense of being able to give them tough feedback.

There are nuances to being “nice” that can make or break you. Being an empathetic, sensitive person who cares about their employees is one thing; being afraid of letting someone go who is underperforming or ill-suited for a position (as one example) is where “nice” and “leadership” should part ways.

Ultimately, you can sacrifice the health of your company or team or own professional livelihood simply because being nice is easier, more comfortable.

So, what if my value system says as a leader, “I should always be nice”?

It’s important to redefine what “nice” means when it relates to leadership. “Nice” shouldn’t mean being a pushover, always saying yes, being incapable of giving constructive feedback, and/or not letting people go. That need will stifle creativity and objectivity and breed a lack of respect toward you by employees.

“Nice” needs to be defined as having a positive impact on your people and the organization as a whole , i.e. positive leadership. What then are the qualities that contribute to having a positive leadership impact?

Research performed by Kim Cameron and colleagues at the University of Michigan points to four essential qualities for cultivating positive leadership and having a positive impact on your organization:

These four qualities are about cultivating warmth, accountability, approachability, and compassion, which go beyond the singular quality of being nice.

Researchers Amy J.C.Cuddy, Peter Glick, and Anna Beningera determined that warmth breeds trust, and “trust increases information sharing, openness, fluidity, and cooperation.” (Cuddy, Fiske, and Glick, 2011)

It might seem that the evidence underscores being “nice,” but there’s a difference between simply being nice and being empathetic, warm, approachable, etc. Being “nice” doesn’t necessarily mean you care about others, it might just mean you care what others think about you, and about how you look to others.

Nor does empathy and these other qualities mean you will do whatever people want and or feel entitled to.

Listening to your people, showing them you care about their lives, maintaining an open door policy – these are all traits of positive leadership that blend the needs of the organization with the needs of the employee. Whereas being nice has the potential to place the needs of one above the needs of all.

Empathy can easily lead to being too nice if not paired with the right perspective.

Wharton professor, Adam Grant, stresses that for the “givers” in the world, empathy can be a leadership trap. If empathy isn’t paired with 360-perspective-taking, defined as taking all viewpoints and needs into account including the needs of the company, then feelings may dominate over objectivity.

This has particular relevance in a salary negotiation between a manager and employee. If the manager is overly empathetic they may overlook what the employee – and the company – needs in favor of what the employee wants.

It’s not hard to imagine this hypothetical scenario: an employee suffers a break-up and they feel the pressure of student loan debt and they express all of this to their manager in a salary negotiation meeting.

The manager operating purely on empathy will be swayed by feeling and potentially cave in. If empathy is paired with perspective-taking, however, the manager can empathize with the person’s life predicament and show compassion while maintaining a realistic perspective on what is relevant to the negotiation.

Here are some tips to help avoid the traps of being too nice:

Positive leadership involves taking the time to get to know your people, being empathetic, approachable and compassionate, but also being mindful of the goals and outcomes you need to achieve.

It’s important to self-examine to see if we’re being overly nice because we need others to like us. Don’t worry about being liked! Your likability will come naturally if you prove you are someone who cares about the wellbeing of her people through positive and impactful leadership.",communication
"Not many professionals like performance reviews. Our shared distaste may be the closest thing we have to a universal belief in the modern business world.

The negative perception of reviews seems to come from deep misunderstandings about the value of the entire process. From a manager’s perspective, an annual performance review requires them to sum up an employee’s body of work for an entire year, and then offer something constructive. From an employee’s perspective, the manager may be considering whether or not the employee warrants a raise or gets to keep their job.

In an attempt to avoid the stress and anxiety of performance reviews, many companies have simply abandoned them. However, that route offers no benefits for the company or its employees. Reviews are opportunities for people to identify ways they can improve job skills and career prospects and receive the help they need in order to do it.

Below are five suggestions for how managers can improve performance reviews and make the process better for everyone. Many of the comments shared here come from having conducted more than 100 performance reviews at several different companies from a boutique tech public relations firm to a larger corporate setting. I’ve tried to compile the best insights gained along the way.

Stick to a regular schedule instead of once per year.

Companies have begun shifting toward frequent, regular feedback with employees rather than just annual or quarterly reviews. Central to this program is a steady schedule of one-on-one meetings between employees and supervisors.

Holding regular one-on-ones can shift perceptions around work feedback. Perhaps most important, regular conversations may defuse and demystify the entire process for both parties. Discussing work, challenges, accomplishments and goals becomes commonplace and appreciated, instead of rare and stressful.

As companies move to regular one-on-one meetings, they may also find the dreaded annual review process becomes much more simple. When managers and employees have been in regular contact throughout the year, and both working toward positive outcomes, the yearly meeting is simply another step. This opens feedback as a channel for improvement, rather than being taken as nothing but reprimands for poor work.

Studies have shown that well-chosen goals can be motivating, with or without a monetary incentive. When building a regular cadence of meetings, managers should use that time to help employees set goals.

These need to be achievable objectives with clear, actionable items. Checking in with these goals should also become central to the regular one-on-one meetings. The manager should not simply select performance improvement goals for the employee -- employees are often far more likely to be motivated by goals they have helped create.

Finally, measurable results should be established for each goal, so employees understand how their progress will be determined. This process of managers and employees working together for improvement and advancement will build stronger relationships of trust and cooperation.

Having worked for several private companies in my past, I’ve found corporate leaders to be quite protective of company information. This begins as a necessary element of a company’s well-being but can slip into hoarding information due to a lack of trust or concerns about control. Likewise, most employees understand that every company has information that needs to be kept private, but when the secrecy goes too far, people may start to believe management is hiding critical information from them.

Developing a system of sharing information can help companies improve the relationships and feedback between managers and employees. By sharing inside information with employees whenever possible -- whether through quarterly meetings or even anecdotal emails from the CEO from time to time -- a company demonstrates its trust in people and encourages employee engagement.

Without question, personnel records and information must always be kept private, and product strategies or road maps need to be carefully guarded. Most other information, including plans for the future and the financial health of the company, can almost always be shared with employees.

Feedback within a company should never flow only in one direction. Building trust between managers and employees means that people need to feel safe enough to express their ideas and have a mutual willingness to consider each other’s viewpoints.

To that end, leadership should make themselves as accessible as possible on a daily basis. One tool for assuring this is the “skip-level meeting,” where employees meet once or twice per year with the person a step above their direct manager on the organizational chart. This practice can help eliminate personal biases and improve visibility across the entire organization. More importantly, it can catch when relationships between talented managers and talented employees are simply not working.

Leaders should wear their titles lightly, and an open company should have few walls, physical or otherwise. When the people at the top are accessible and open to feedback, it will help reinforce the goal of everyone striving for the same objectives.

Employee recognition is the final step that ties everything together. Like feedback, recognizing the work and contributions of people in an organization should be more regular than handing out an employee of the month award.

Regular recognition from managers should include acknowledgment of hard work and jobs well done but also encompass important employee dates, like work anniversaries. When managers share recognition and goal achievements with departments (and companies, when appropriate), employees’ sense of appreciation and engagement may grow.

The only caveat is that managers often fall into the trap of “balancing” praise with constructive feedback, as if unqualified praise will somehow remove the employee’s incentive to work hard. Leaders should remember to keep it to praise when it has been earned. Save the feedback for a one-on-one meeting.

As workplace expectations and practices continue to evolve, the benefits of feedback should be a major element of the relationships between managers and employees. By following these steps, companies can ensure feedback continues to strengthen the organization and its people.",coaching
"Millennials receive a lot of flack for the massive transformations occurring in business today. To baby boomers and older generations, the workforce is almost unrecognizable. The shift from a customer-centric to employee-centric experience has redefined business strategies from the ground up.

Employers once ruled the market with the privilege of being able to hook the best candidates with an attractive compensation package and upgrade in title. Today, the priorities have changed to focus more on development, transparency and work-life balance. Many companies are struggling to adapt and are facing a loss in top talent.

If businesses want to remain competitive in their industry, they have to redesign their business from the bottom up with a focus on the internal culture. The popular TV series, The Office, remains a hit among viewers because of its ability to mimic the realities of the daunting outward focused corporate culture.

The siloed office floors filled with hundreds of dull, lifeless cubicles, an uninspiring atmosphere and non-existent culture have been revamped to include a more interactive, engaging and welcoming environment. The barriers from the hierarchical cultures are being demolished and used as the foundation for the flat organizations' that new generations crave . This isn’t the only change businesses are facing.

Here are the five ways millennials are shaking up the workforce and undoing everything baby boomers once knew

Soft skills have been slow to gain momentum in business as hard skills are easier to measure and identify. In recent years, businesses are refocusing their priorities from a “leave your personal life at home” mentality to understanding how to become more self-aware of their own emotions as well as their employees.

When employees feel valued and cared for, their motivation and job performance increases and retention decreases. If employers neglect the soft skills and only focus on the hard skills, it creates barriers in the relationship and risks tarnishing the morale of the company. Companies such as Google have this down pat. Their mindfulness training course helps teach employees skills that improve their emotional intelligence, decrease their stress and increase their communication.

The thick walls that separate each layer of the hierarchy are now used as the foundation to support a flat organization where communication is open and everyone interacts on the same playing field. According to a recent article in Forbes, “millennials will only interact with brands that are open and transparent, stand for more than their bottom line, and address environmental and socioeconomic issues in the community.”

Sites like Glassdoor, Kununu, social media platforms and online forums make finding out insider information easier than ever. This information helps millennials carefully weigh their decision to apply, interview or accept a position with a company.

Working from home is no longer a luxury but instead a requirement. While traditional 401K benefits are still popular, they’re not preferred. Instead, millennials want flexibility and the option for remote work. Employers like Yahoo implemented a remote work policy early on giving their employees the flexibility to be closer to their kids, ditch the commute and work from the comfort of their home. In 2013, the then CEO, Marissa Meyer, stirred up controversy for going backward and requiring all remote workers to work in the office or lose their job. This didn't end up so well for the internet company. As of 2017, they were bought out by Verizon and the Meyer resigned after being unable to turn the company around.

According to SHRM, millennials may not even consider a job opportunity if it doesn’t offer a remote work opportunity. The challenge businesses face with the new wave of remote workers is keeping them engaged and maintaining the relationship. It’s easy to keep remote workers siloed when you can’t see them. It’s crucial to have a strategy in place to keep them in the loop and feeling a part of the team. When employees feel a part of the team, their motivation, productivity and loyalty increases.

With America being the most overworked country in the world, the US has a long way to go in terms of achieving work-life balance compared to the European countries such as Switzerland, Denmark, Norway or the Netherlands. The typical culture has employees taking work home with them, long hours of overtime and working over the weekend. A study last year showed that an average of 41% of American workers don’t take a single vacation day.

It’s shocking one of the most developed countries in the world still operates on an underdeveloped mindset. While the new generation receives a lot of flack for not accepting traditional working methods, they’re the only generation speaking up and fighting for balance. This outspokenness is helping to speed up the process forcing companies to reevaluate their benefit offerings with a strong focus on work-life harmony.

As the tech boom spreads globally, companies are shifting away from traditional paper trail methods instead focusing on enhancing their systems and equipment to increase speed and efficiency. The new generation is more flexible, open to change and willing to get hands-on to discover new techniques.

The phrase “if it’s not broke, don’t fix it” is crippling to their creativity as they thrive off of staying ahead of the tech curve to discover new methods of completing tasks and automating processes. As the leaders of the future, the new generation is retiring redundancy in business and making employers adopt a more streamlined process.

Companies can reap many benefits from joining the tech revolution by saving time and money, creating a better experience for clients and employees while expanding their reach. Remaining on top of trends helps in continually developing employee skill sets. This commitment to future proofing your business is a great way to retain top talent.",
"Relentless effort was one of George Washington’s outstanding leadership qualities; the other was emotional control or what we now call emotional self-regulation, an element of emotional intelligence. Simply put, it is the ability to not lash out or act out despite strong feelings. “Regulating emotion is exhausting. But doing so almost never makes things worse,” Sam Walker says in a Wall Street Journal article (registration required) about Washington’s leadership.

Let’s not confuse emotional self-regulation with the stoic disregard for human feelings, both one’s own and others’.  The ability to not flip out is a proven element of strong leadership. This does not mean emotional experiences should be swept under the rug. Rather, it means effective leadership requires being aware of them and reflecting on the sources, meaning and response options. Emotional reactions are a source of information and wisdom.

Leaders who are afraid to notice their emotions are blocking a valuable source of information. Leaders will not refuse to read a balance sheet to enhance their effectiveness or because they are afraid of the bad news, but they may disregard an emotional reaction. Those reactions do need to be tempered with a pause for reflection and to ensure that one’s old worn paths are not inappropriately being activated in a situation that does not currently call for an extreme reaction. With some vigilance, impulsive reactions and comments of the blurt and hurt variety can be managed, without losing the benefits of awareness.

Familiar situations — for example, not being given due credit or being left out of an important decision — can be an uncomfortable reminder of previous situations where credit or inclusion was unfairly withheld. Feelings of exclusion can be painful: We are social beings whose connection to others is essential for survival. But today’s situation needs to be considered on its own merits and context, without the unconscious energy boost of past injustice or hurt.

Instead, leaders need to notice the feeling and even notice the exaggerated feeling. A little reflection may lead to wondering, ""What does it mean? Where exactly is that emotion anchored in the body?""

Leaders who lack this awareness can inadvertently foster mistrust if their expression and emotion and are not appropriate to the situation.

I remember the first time my own executive coach asked me this, many years before I became a coach. I had no idea where a feeling was. And I didn’t know what use it would be, even if I could find it. In my tense shoulder? In my pressured head? In my beating heart?

But over the years, my own heightened awareness of the physiology of emotion led me to be more familiar with the meaning of those signals. I became better able to translate them and follow the emotional thread back to the cause. Sometimes the source was so minor, such as a traffic scare or an unreturned call, that I could immediately clear my body’s tension and my mind’s distraction. That empirical evidence of my experience, coupled with reading up on neurological research presented in layman’s terms, has changed my mind.

I have learned that feelings actually start as sensations in the body. The expression ""gut reaction"" has scientific proof. There are neurons in the stomach and heart just as there are in the brain, and the signals transmit in seconds. Knowing your physical reaction to an emotion is a secret code that you can learn to decipher. It’s pretty easy once you tune in, but tuning in requires a new habit of thinking.

It was also beneficial for me, as an executive coach supporting stressed executives, to be clear of lingering reactions or vulnerable triggers. It’s my role to be present with those leaders. Being aware of emotions is a valuable channel of knowledge; being able to clear those emotions when they are not relevant simply makes me more effective.

In my book Zoom Leadership, I recommend being aware of emotion as well as altering your perspective by zooming in, closer to the feeling to be sure you are not discounting or denying it. Zoom out to get some distance and context and evaluate the reaction against the circumstances to determine its value in that moment. This ability to change your focus breaks the spell that a strong feeling might have.

We don’t know whether George Washington disregarded his own feelings to achieve the emotional control that characterized his leadership. We don’t know if he was aware of it. We do know about his results and the tribute that towns across the country pay him in street signs, school buildings and statues. We can combine the knowledge of his accomplishments with new information about neurology and emotions. Those leadership qualities are no longer regarded as static character attributes -- they are success skills that can be learned through awareness.",
"One of the foolishly persistent ideas in modern education crops up in a variety of settings. It may be the offhand remark by a professional development presenter that you no longer need to teach particular content because it's available on line. It may be the school administrator who casually observes that we can focus less on content knowledge because ""students can just google that stuff."" Or it can be more weighty pronouncements from leaders like Expert in Residence at Harvard's Innovation Lab Tony Wagner:

Forbes carried that quote in a 2012 article, but it still travels the interwebs, cheerfully memed and shared by those who believe it.

All of this is wrong. The internet is not a substitute for your brain.

For one thing, your brain is not a computer. As research psychologist Robert Epstein laid out in his essay ""The Empty Brain,"" your brain ""does not process information, retrieve knowledge or store memories."" Because your brain is not a computer, the metaphor of using the internet as a sort of external hard drive for your brain simply makes no more sense than having an external hard drive hooked up to a can of spam.

For another thing, the internet is full of baloney. Recently we've seen discussion of the ways in which YouTube algorithms promote extreme fringe ideas to its viewers, including pushing the flat earth theory. ""Just google it"" is a recipe for misinformation on the grand scale, unless, of course, the googler possesses enough knowledge to be able to evaluate the content of the information she discovers on line.

Since the early days of No Child Left Behind, education reform has pushed the notion that certain academic skills exist independent of any particular content knowledge. This belief in the supremacy of content-free skills is not unique to education. American business has long been plagued by the idea that if an executive has certain managerial skills, he can manage any company no matter how little he understands about what the company actually does.

But all skills exist within a context and work through a medium. You cannot perfect waves without a medium for them to move through. Reading skills are knowledge-dependent. For the simplest example, consider using phonics to sound out a word--you may sound out a word you've never heard in your life, but you still won't know what it means. And context clues only help if you have enough knowledge to understand the context.

We acquire new knowledge by fitting it into relationship with the knowledge we already have. We don't fill up a student's head with information any more than we fill muscles with coordination.

There is always a competitive advantage to knowing more than the people around you, because all understanding and skills are based on knowledge. If you have to look up the facts, you will not fully grasp what to do with them--if you are even able to determine whether they are true or not in the first place. Yes, the world wants to see what you can do with what you know, but the less you know, the less you can do.",
"As a manager, this is probably something you’ve had to communicate at least once before, if not many times.

While turning down job applicants is common enough (hey, everyone can’t get the spot), it’s more likely that you’ve said “no” to folks applying from outside the company, not from within.

So what happens when an internal candidate applies and you have to let them know that they didn’t get the job? How exactly do you break the news to someone you already work so closely with—and appropriately manage their expectations moving forward?

Answering these questions is more nuanced than rejecting an external candidate. After all, this is someone who believes in your company and wants to grow their skills and responsibilities there rather than somewhere else—that’s why they went after that internal transfer to begin with.

As the CEO of PhotoShelter and someone who’s dealt with this situation a lot, I’ve learned five key lessons about navigating the murky waters of turning down internal applicants.

Email may be a blessing and a curse (my inbox screams curse at the moment), but we can all agree it makes communication easier and faster. It’s not, however, the right channel for breaking bad news to your employee.

As busy as you are, it’s critical to sit down face to face to explain your final decision. In these scenarios, your tone, facial expressions, and body language can all make a tremendous positive impact on how your employee feels about the outcome. The fact that you’re willing to take time out of your day to have this conversation in the first place also speaks volumes.

An in-person meeting requires a bit of planning on your part. You’ll need to think critically about what you’re going to say and how you’re going to say it (writing your thoughts down or running them by a colleague or your HR department might help).





 It’s important that you’re clear not only about your decision, but also the reasons behind it. The thing about an internal transfer versus an external candidate is that the person is already deemed a culture fit—which means the reasons they didn’t get the job are most likely about their experience or lack thereof. So, you’re in a better position to give them honest, direct feedback that will make sense to them and ultimately help them improve.

For example, if the applicant didn’t have an important skill needed for the job, specify what that skill was. If another candidate was a better fit, explain why. Whatever you do, don’t leave the person without any explanation at all.

Often, an employee might apply for an internal transfer for the wrong reasons. Maybe they feel stuck on their current team and are just looking for something—anything—new. So, the position they applied for may not actually be in line with their own career aspirations.

This is where it can help to have an open conversation about their professional goals. What title would they love to have one day? Who do they admire professionally? What part of the company or their job gets them most excited? Understanding these aspirations will help you recommend ways they can build on these skills and passions in their current role (and thus get them to stick around longer), and pursue future roles that better align with these goals.

As someone higher up, you know better than anyone where the company is headed and what opportunities for growth are realistically available.

For example, what additional revenue streams or product developments are you considering? And what kind of team will be required to tackle those pursuits once they’re set in motion?





 Share these future opportunities with your employee by explaining where you’re hoping the company will go and how they could potentially take part in fostering that growth. Additionally, come up with a plan to help them be best aligned for such a role when it eventually comes along. They may get even more excited about those possibilities than the original job they went after.

After all is said and done, you should still check in with the person after a few days or weeks. Offer to grab lunch, step out for coffee, or schedule a quick meeting.

To put it simply, this shows you care. You care about how your employee is feeling, how their current work is moving along, and if they have further thoughts after your discussion. Checking in makes employees feel valued and heard—which builds lasting affinity for and loyalty to your company.





 My experiences of having to reject internal candidates have taught me that even when you have to deliver bad news, it’s actually a very good sign when someone’s expressed genuine interest in new opportunities at your company. It means your employees like working for you and can see themselves there for the long term.

Most importantly, it’s your job to foster that spirit and help them get to where they want to be—regardless of the fact that they didn’t land this specific role. Doing so will only strengthen your relationship and the overall success of your business.",
"Diversity and inclusion aren't just trendy business buzzwords. Research suggests that companies that embrace diversity perform better than companies that don't make it a priority. But hiring a diverse workforce is only half the equation.

In order for companies to truly reap the benefits of the diverse thinking, backgrounds, and ideas of their workforce, employees have to feel comfortable, safe, and empowered to be themselves. They need to be able to express their opinions and ideas. To take smart risks. To feel not just like they're invited to the table but that they have a voice at the table. This is what is meant by inclusion.

There are many actions leaders can take to foster an inclusive environment in their teams. I discuss one of the most crucial--psychological safety--in a recent column.

But there are workplace dynamics that can harm efforts at creating inclusion. One of the most damaging is the dynamic of insiders and outsiders.

The terms ""insider"" and ""outsider"" might bring to mind popular teenagers who actively exclude others from joining their clique. But in the context of a corporate environment, the behaviors at play can be much more subtle, embedded, and even undetected to some.

For example, consider one of my clients: Jeff, who works for an international tech company. Jeff's team is comprised of people in the same time zone as the corporate headquarters, while others, like Jeff, live several time zones away. Jeff often starts his day by working on a project, only to learn the company changed direction or canceled the project completely the night before. He and his immediate colleagues were left out of the decision making because they were asleep. Jeff feels like an outsider, while the rest of his team are perceived as insiders.

Workers who smoke might discuss business with other smokers during smoke breaks, leaving non-smokers out of the loop. A company might schedule activities around drinking during its annual summit, making non-drinkers feel left out. A manager might simply respond more positively to outgoing personalities, elevating their voices and ignoring those who are more reserved.

When an insider/outsider dynamic exists, there can be unintended bias in decision making and unconscious biases in the selecting and grooming of individuals for promotion. There can be excessive barriers based on hierarchy--those on the ""outside"" simply can't break through the barriers that would place them on the ""inside.""

This dynamic can also create unequal and inequitable standards. Simply said, the ""insiders"" can seem to operate with their own rules and norms, while the ""outsiders"" don't know what those are.

They should be aware of when the dynamic is occurring and take immediate steps to override it: Share information; include all invested parties in decision-making; amplify voices that aren't being heard; share the unwritten rules with people who don't know them; elevate and empower people so they can break through the barriers of hierarchy.",
"In a tumultuous year when clashing values and natural disasters are rendering the fabric of American society, it can truthfully feel like a chore to muster gratitude. Sometimes all it takes is a simple act of generosity to lift our spirits and remind ourselves to give thanks, and when that act coincides with something you need to do or buy anyway, all the easier. As you buy gifts and prep for the holidays this year, consider forgoing that Black Friday China-made piece of junk to buy something on #GivingTuesday instead.

As a spin-off of Small Business Saturday and Cyber Monday, Giving Tuesday is a time to buy items that will benefit charity. The following beer, wine and spirits companies are either running special promotions this Tuesday, this month or this year, or they’re generally charitable companies that embody the meaning of community all year ‘round.

This past Thursday, the brewery co-hosted four Thanksgiving meal services for displaced residents at Chico State University and welcomed friends from Russian River Brewing as volunteers. And after launching the Sierra Nevada Camp Fire Relief Fund with $100,000 in seed money to distribute to local non-profits for post-fire rebuilding, the Grossman family invited all interested breweries to make their own version of a new IPA called Resilience Butte County Proud, all of whose proceeds will benefit the fund. Sierra will brew its Resilience Tuesday and release it early next year. As of Tuesday morning, approximately 400 U.S. breweries had signed on. Because Trumer Brewery in Berkeley only brews pilsners, it has donated $100,000 to the fund and $10,000 directly to Sierra Nevada employees who needed assistance after the fires. While you won’t be able to buy Resilience beers for a few weeks at the earliest, you can donate to the fund or patronize participating breweries on Tuesday or any time.",
"When in office, President Barack Obama had a work 'uniform’: he would only wear gray or blue suits. The reason, as he told Vanity Fair, was to reduce the number of choices he was forced to make in one day:

Every choice takes a modicum of time and mental effort, and powerful leaders – whether in politics or business – are forced to resource guard their time - it being the most precious asset of all.

Business owners can glean plenty from former presidents and their unique styles of working, like Theodore Roosevelt who was famed for his almost superhuman productivity. He was said to devour whole books before breakfast and published 50 of his own.

Roosevelt was also a top academic achiever but it was observed that he did not seem to study as much as his peers. Instead, he worked in very short, very intensive bursts, and was an expert at blocking out all possible distractions while he did so.

He wasn't the only president good at filtering out noise. In a 1954 address, then-President Dwight D. Eisenhower quoted these words which he commented were “a dilemma of modern man”:

Thus, Eisenhower is credited with the creation of a simple four-square grid, said to have improved his efficiency. Called the Eisenhower – or Urgent Important – Matrix, it involves taking every item on one's to-do list and plotting it onto the grid, helping a busy person decide what to tackle first, what to delegate and what not to waste time on.

These are the rules:

The reason this presidential productivity method is so useful is because urgent tasks can quite easily push the important ones to the bottom of the pile.

Hacking up a to-do list, applying a liberal dose of ruthlessness, and putting it through a stress test before taking any action is a good way to make sure no time is wasted on tasks that are a) irrelevant or b) something that someone else could be doing, and possibly doing better.

We are naturally inclined to move on the urgent tasks first, before tackling the quick and easy ‘bits’ that offer small bursts of satisfaction with every strike-through. But this approach distracts us from the big, important, and often complex, stuff.

Part of this stems from the fact many entrepreneurs have very little sense of what they should be spending their time on, and what constitutes a waste of it. The most common question I get asked by startup owners is: ""What should I be working on?"".

One of the best exercises for improved productivity is to write out your job description - a document some entrepreneurs will never have possessed before.

The president’s job description is – on paper – extraordinary, demanding the person fulfilling that role to be all at once a diplomat, a ceremonial head, a chief executive and chief administrator, leader of their political party, representative of all people, author of public policy and commander of the Armed Forces. And that’s around fitting in some semblance of a personal life.

Mine, and that of other growing business owners, will probably look more like this:

Similar to Eisenhower’s technique, any task that falls outside of this job description should be outsourced, delegated or struck off if it’s neither urgent nor important.

You might not be POTUS, but you need to start valuing your time by applying just as much discipline.",
"The number of women on the combined executive committee and direct reports has increased to 27% in 2018, according to this year's Hampton-Alexander review.

However, more progress is required to achieve the review's targets of 33% for women by 2020, with half of all available appointments in the next two years going to women. The appointment rate for these roles still remain heavily skewed towards men, with around 65% of all newly available roles going to men.

Ruth Sealy, associate professor of management at Exeter University pointed out that the female and male appointment ratio of 35%/65% was unthinkable a few years ago. “It is a figure that creates change to a point, from a low starting level but then will never lead to full gender balance.”

The Hampton-Alexander Review is calling for 50:50 appointment rate, which will be very challenging for business bosses to stomach and to actually achieve, added Sealy.

Clearly, the progress is nowhere near fast enough, commented Ann Francke, chief executive of the Chartered Management Institute.

It’s important to recognize that if you put those numbers in context then what you have is a stagnation in numbers. We’ve clearly got to accelerate that progress. One obvious suggestion for accelerating progress is that 97% of FTSE350 have diversity policies but only 15% actually comply with Financial Reporting Council’s requirement of reporting diversity. Companies need to do a much better job of adhering to those guidelines.”

The FTSE100 has progressed more in line with expectations this year with the number of women on FTSE100 boards at 30.2% in 2018, up from 27.7%. If progress continues at this rate, then the FTSE100 is 'on track' to achieve the 33% target for Women on Boards by 2020. The stand-out companies that have 50% women on their boards include Next, Rightmove, Taylor Wimpey and Hargreaves Lansdown.

The FTSE250 has seen a slower year with the number of women on the combined executive committee and direct reports increasing marginally to 24.9% in 2018, up from 24% last year.

It’s important not to lose sight of the fact that executive positions where the ability to influence key decision-making and strategy is held, is still overwhelmingly held by men, commented Michelle Chance, partner and head of London employment team at transatlantic law firm Womble Bond Dickinson UK.

More concerning is that 75 companies in the FTSE350 only have one woman on their board. This expresses the philosophy of ‘one and done’ among companies, remarked Francke.

Sealy expressed concern that so many companies still only had one woman on the board.

The number of All-Male boards is down to five from 10 last year, still five too many and the number of women in CEOs or Chair roles have barely moved. Sealy remarked that the topic of gender diversity on boards had been around for a long time.

There is definitely stagnation when it comes to the number of female CEOs, commented Francke.",
"I was out to breakfast recently with my family, and we have an active 2.5 year old. As I got her settled in her chair, I pulled out her crayons, coloring books and assorted toys, trying to decide what she might want to eat. We looked around the colorfully decorated room, shaped like an igloo and Lucy immediately noticed the green tinsel hanging from the windows. We talked about all of the various decorations for another 10 minutes – the kid notices everything! As my eyes scanned the room, I noticed something eerily quiet in the corner – a family of four in silence, each and every one of them focused on some type of screen. I watched them on and off throughout breakfast, and not once did they look at each other, only at their screens, and eventually at the meals placed in front of them.

Sadly, screen time has become our default. Waiting for your flight? Pull out your phone. Waiting for your friends to arrive and feeling bored?  Look at your phone. Not enough action in the meeting you’re attending? Reach for your phone. Cal Newport, author and professor of computer science at Georgetown, hopes to usher in a new era called Digital Minimalism, a philosophy of technology use in which you focus your online time in a small number of carefully selected activities that strongly support the things you value.

In his book Irresistible, NYU Stern School of Business professor Adam Alter summarizes the research about the irresistible urge to use technology, and the businesses that spend millions of dollars to keep you hooked. Guidelines suggest that you should spend less than an hour a day on our phones, yet research shows that only 12% of phone users meet that criteria – that means 88% of people overuse, with the overall average being three hours. Alter goes on to detail a survey of young adults that revealed that 46% of them said they would rather break a bone than break their phone – and many of the 54% who said they’d rather have a broken phone agonized about that decision.

Email is one of the biggest job demands (aspects of your work that take consistent effort and energy) busy professionals have today, and I consistently hear this in my presentations about burnout at work. According to one survey, “almost one-third of U.S. workers report replying within 15 minutes of receiving a work email, and more than three-fourths reply within an hour.”

When you are at work, constantly toggling between checking email and doing other work activities taxes your mental and emotional capacities. The very act of switching between tasks takes mental effort, which in turn limits your cognitive capacity and the result is more distraction and stress. In addition, frequent multitasking often results in worse performance across all tasks and can compromise emotional well-being, leading to less positivity.

One study measured two groups of people – one group was asked to check their email frequently throughout the day, while the other group was asked to check it only three times a day. They found that the group who chunked their email checking had lower levels of tension and overall day-to-day stress. As a result, the lower levels of stress translated into higher levels of mindfulness, self-perceived productivity, and better sleep.

Try setting aside a dedicated chunk of time several times each day where you do nothing but answer email. Once that time is up, move on to something else. I started doing this when I’m in my office, and it has helped my concentration immensely (especially when it comes to focused tasks like writing this article).  It is seductive to think that we have to check our email constantly, just in case there might be an emergency. We have been conditioned to think everything is urgent and that something urgent is always lurking around the corner.

In addition to chunking your email checking, here are two additional strategies to try:

Download the app Moment. If you’re really interested in tracking how much time you spend on your phone, download an app called Moment.  Most people underestimate their phone usage by about 50%. Not all phone use is created equal – Moment actually stops tracking the time if you’re using your phone to make a call or listen to music.

Try breaking the habit. This may be hard, but there is a specific process you can use. In his book The Power of Habit, Charles Duhigg summarizes the research surrounding how habits are formed (and broken). Habits are created via a three-part loop – a cue, a routine, and a reward (or payoff). If you want to break a habit, the trick is to keep the cue and the reward the same, but change the routine. For example, if you want to break the habit of mindlessly checking your phone, figure out your habit loop: I get bored (the cue), start checking fantasy football scores (the routine), then my body relaxes (the reward). Now change the routine: when you get bored, instead of reaching for your phone, pull out a magazine or book, crochet, or make dinner.  The reward should still be feeling relaxed.

Technology isn’t going away, and when used correctly, it has the ability to make our lives easier and support the values we hold dear. It’s important for us to make sure we’re using it to its highest and best use.

"Absurdly Driven looks at the world of business with a skeptical eye and a firmly rooted tongue in cheek.

I rarely hear about how happy they are.

Something is amiss with the way they believe the airline is treating them.

And now the Flight Attendants have had enough.

The Association of Flight Attendants -- the United Flight Attendants' union -- has announced it's launching a Day of Action against the airline.

The Flight Attendants have a long list of grievances that they say the airline has consistently ignored.

These include payroll issues, poor hotel accommodations and crew scheduling -- including the sneaky system I described a couple of weeks ago, which some Flight Attendants believe deliberately tries to get around giving them the legally mandated 10-hour rest period.

Worse, say the Flight Attendants, the airline is deliberately reducing staffing.

As my colleague Bill Murphy Jr. reported, United has given up on plating food in the air and simultaneously reduced the number of Flight Attendants on certain flights.

As part of their Day of Action, the Flight Attendants union has already made a mockery of United's Core4 logo.

Core4 was the airline's attempt at emphasizing the basics of customer service -- Safe, Caring, Efficient and Dependable.

The union's new version of the logo has the headline #CORED and depicts an apple that's been eaten away.

As if one hashtag isn't enough, there's also another: #Enough.

We will continue to work closely with the AFA on issues that are important to our flight attendants. We don't expect any impact on our customers.

The trouble with the unexpected is that it sometimes happens.

It's unclear what specific actions the union might want to take. But if you don't want to be confronted by, say, picketing, chan Flight Attendants, perhaps you should avoid flying United on December 13.

That's the day the union intends to make its voices heard.

Not all Flight Attendants are fully supportive of the union, however. I've heard from some Flight Attendants who believe the union is largely ineffective.",
"The holiday season has arrived and with that comes additional stress for many. Between family, friends, personal well being, work, and travel--many new obstacles present themselves during this time of the year.

Speaking of travel, this year is shaping up to be the busiest in 13 years, according to AAA. Thanksgiving alone, 44.3 million Americans are projected to travel 50 or more miles away from their home.

With travel plus the additional activities of the holidays, energy often times becomes spread thin, leaving people heading into the new year fatigue and carrying a few extra pounds.

But, the holidays don't have to equate to a sentence of stress and frazzled thinking which bleeds over into lower productivity. You can maintain your sanity, energy, and productivity during the holidays by focusing on these three key principles.

With extra activities on the horizon, the first thing to, unfortunately, hit the chopping block is personal well being. It's easy to lose sight of your own needs with so many things going on. However, it's imperative that you always put your own oxygen mask on first.

When you don't take care of yourself, not only are you suffering but others are as well since they aren't getting the best version of you. During the holiday season, getting organized with a planner or calendar is paramount.

A financial advisor will encourage you to set aside accounts for your retirement, unforeseen accidents, and investments among other things. In this scenario, your advisor is helping you to front-load your work.

With the holidays, the same philosophy applies. With ample amounts of extracurricular activities on the horizon, there's a high probability that things will go against your liking. In this instance, take some time to think of obstacles and scenarios where things could go wrong.

After you identify those potential issues, craft up a solution and how you will emotionally respond to the situation. Doing this kind of work beforehand helps you maintain a sense of control which lessens potential anxiety and stress from overwhelming your emotions.

3. Adopt a something is better than nothing philosophy.

Hectic schedules and traveling can, often times, serve as impending doom to people's healthy habits. But with a simple mindset shift, staying healthy and energetic during the holidays is more than feasible.

During this season, your normal routine will be affected. But, doing something is better than doing nothing. If you can't make it to the gym, doing bodyweight exercises at home is valuable. Going for a run and taking in the new sights of a city you're visiting is putting a checkmark beside the tourist and healthy habit box.",
"Why is it that some companies thrive and grow, while others fade away? In her book Fusion, Denise Yohn (with whom I've worked in the past), explains that today's most successful businesses -- companies like Airbnb, Nike, Google, Southwest, and Starbucks -- do something different from the competition. They succeed because they align and integrate their brands and cultures.

According to Yohn, there are five specific strategies for achieving brand-culture fusion. The first four of these strategies focus on cultivating your desired culture by aligning it with your existing brand identity. The fifth strategy takes the opposite approach: leveraging your existing culture to change your brand and as a result align both.

Here are the five powerful strategies for aligning your brand and culture:

Implement an organizational design and run your operations to give your organization the structure and processes necessary to operationalize your culture.

Deliberately design and manage your company's employee experience -- just as you would customer experiences -- so that every facet of an employee's journey throughout his or her connection to your organization encourages and enables your desired culture.

Ensure even the most mundane or minute aspect of your organization -- from its ""rituals"" and ""artifacts"" (things your organization regularly does and creates to commemorate or symbolize important achievements or events) to its policies and procedures -- advances and supports your desired culture.

Use employee brand engagement tactics -- stage employee brand engagement experiences, launch creative communication campaigns, and develop and deploy employee brand engagement toolkits -- to kickstart the fusion process and then to regain focus and momentum when necessary.

5. Build your brand from the inside out.

If your culture is so powerful or established that it doesn't make sense to try to change it to achieve brand-culture fusion, leverage your existing culture to define or re-define your brand identity.

As today's most successful companies have clearly demonstrated, creating a fusion of brand and culture has its benefits. Explains Yohn, ""Brand-culture fusion has the potential to improve the competitiveness and accelerate the growth of almost any organization, regardless of its size or type.""

If you aren't already aligning your company brand and culture, perhaps it's time to give it a try.",
"Ready or not, the artificial intelligence revolution is here and marketers who have embraced it have a serious competitive edge. One of the most exciting applications is the ability to gain insights into aspects of content performance that previously were the domain of the “creative genius.”

Today, our company uses artificial intelligence (AI) as a tool to access and optimize previously unavailable data about all aspects of content. AI software has the ability to uncover the subtle truths regarding the content characteristics that an audience responds to. This can be an extremely powerful tool because it takes the guessing out of what content to produce in order to gain the highest levels of conversion.

Many people can’t identify for themselves what subtle triggers move them to conversion; this is what makes these triggers so effective. These under-the-radar characteristics are, by nature, nearly impossible to find through manual social media analysis, but artificial intelligence can identify the patterns and use them to provide a game-changing competitive advantage.

Based on my experience, cluster analysis is one of the most effective tools for identifying what elements of content do or do not resonate with an audience. Cluster analysis divides data into subsections that are meaningful and useful.

This is an important tool in the social sciences, biology, statistics, pattern recognition and, now, marketing. In marketing, cluster analysis can group content based on elements like objects in pictures or videos, the color schemes and post copy. It can then identify how the various elements are impacting the performance of a given piece of content.

A cluster analysis can be beneficial to marketing efforts because of its ability to recognize which aspects of your content are performing well and which are not. From a practical standpoint, this allows marketers to increase the amount of high-performing content. Additionally, a cluster analysis identifies key characteristics of content performing below average. By being able to identify aspects to avoid, you can explore new ways to visually show the topics you need.

At Cortex, for instance, we recently examined the social media campaign strategy of a tourism destination’s Instagram page. After discovering that skiing-related posts were the lowest performing, the organization wanted to improve its social media efforts before the upcoming ski season. Through cluster analysis, we were able to identify how the brand’s main categories of photos performed on specific social media pages. Particularly, we looked at what kinds of skiing-related photos the audience found most engaging. This helped us to determine the optimal photos to use to reach the target audience.

Cluster analysis is based on patterns found in past content published by your brand. It’s important to keep in mind that it can only reveal the most beneficial content of past options, so the more content data available, the better the analysis will be. Marketers can also create cluster analysis reports on competitors’ pages, which provides a two-way guide of what to do and what not to do in marketing.

This tool, combined with computer vision and other features of AI technology, allows marketers to finally stretch their legs when it comes to creative decisions. Creative decisions are no longer primarily riddled with human bias. Using cluster analysis and other advanced analysis techniques not only increase performance by creating content that works but also defends marketer’s decisions to peers and clients with concrete data. Here’s to more effective content!",None
"Studies show that decisions made during the first few months of a CEO's tenure are disproportionately important in determining his or her success. However, several issues -- unique to CEOs and often overlooked -- complicate or even cloud good decision-making.

First, new CEOs often spread themselves thin in an attempt to understand every stakeholder and nuance of the business. Second, they are heavily shaped by current employees' perspectives.

These factors can lead to a superficial, biased or insufficient understanding of the organization's strengths and weaknesses.

If you're a chief exec or even an executive leader:

Now that you've identified them, ask yourself:

One Gallup client learned his best customers were leaving not because they had problems, but because too many people were involved in fixing them.

Another CEO was mystified that his best salespeople were performing so badly -- Gallup consultants revealed that a lack of reliable office management had a direct correlation with their performance.

Seemingly small things can have a huge effect -- and those small things are easy to overlook. Even when promoted from within, a new CEO's perception of an organization's talent assets can be limited. We all best understand the people we know well and the business units with which we're most familiar. Yet a CEO's view must be comprehensive and extremely thorough to effectively distinguish, retain and get the most out of revenue-producing talent.

The nature of the CEO's job makes it difficult to recognize the nuances of employee and customer interactions and their effect on the business. Assessing that effect requires a thorough process, one geared toward finding the best direction to pursue using the strengths of your human capital assets to find opportunities for customer relationships.

According to a May article from McKinsey & Company, ""67% of new CEOs, looking back, wish they had moved faster to change the culture."" That is understandable -- but how are new CEOs supposed to know what needs changing? The cultural elements that matter most in attracting and retaining the best talent and the best customers can be very hard to identify.

And very few CEOs, new or not, have the time, capacity or resources to accurately identify the specific behaviors among individuals, departments and business segments that routinely motivate employees to be a star every day.

That's why Gallup scientists and consultants identify the capabilities and strengths of those in significant roles -- usually via carefully constructed focus groups and stakeholder interviews -- to identify common points of pride, purpose and motivation. That equips CEOs to develop and implement strategies that fit their culture or, if need be, reconstruct their culture.

Too few are so equipped, it appears: The average tenure of an S&P 500 CEO is five years, which is a year less than it was in 2013. That's chilling, and may cause up-and-coming leaders to hesitate before taking on the ultimate responsibility for a company.

It is true that new CEOs face some daunting challenges, but they can increase their odds of success if they get the facts they need to make decisions and set priorities. They don't have much time to do it, though -- research shows the average CEO tenure is decreasing rather than increasing. Not getting accurate, objective, performance-related insights is a mistake any new CEO can make. But the right advice and analytics can prevent it from becoming a career-ending mistake.

"Taylor Swift is taking her music to a new record label, Republic Records and Universal Music Group. With this career move, she scored major benefits. Now, Swift will own her master recordings and other artists under the same label also will be paid for their music that is streamed on Spotify. Swift is taking command over her career and reshaping how the industry works.

You can command your career, too, whether it is asking for a raise or promotion, weighing job offers or making your work environment better. Learn from Swift’s leadership, and set yourself up as a power player in your career with these three tips:

1. Recognize your value in the industry.

Selling over 40 million albums, Taylor Swift is one of the best-selling music artists of all time. She has won 10 Grammys and countless other awards. Swift earned $80 million in 2018 and is worth $320 million.

Over the past decade, Taylor Swift has made herself into a superstar while at her previous record label (which owns six of her albums). Swift said in an Instagram post to her followers, “It’s really important to me to see eye to eye with a label regarding the future of our industry.” The megastar now knew she had the power to negotiate with executives and move her career to a new level.

You don’t have to be a megastar to star in your own career. To increase your power, identify the metrics in your business or role that show success. Think about what your manager emphasizes or what your role model does that makes them successful. Metrics could include, for example, the amount of sales you bring in, the amount of money you save or the amount of time you save. Put in the work to start moving in the direction and achieve the numbers and results that will make you successful and provide you opportunities and options in the future.

2. Identify how you want to make an impact, and advocate not just for yourself but also for your colleagues.

“There was one condition that meant more to me than any other deal point. As part of my new contract with Universal Music Group, I asked that any sale of their Spotify shares results in distribution of money to their artists, non-recoupable,” wrote Swift. This is not the first time she has lobbied to increase the pay of artists. She criticized Apple in a letter for their practice of not paying artists when their music streaming service launched.

Taylor Swift doesn’t just want to make her career better. She wants to make other people’s careers better, too. This new contract is bigger than her. She was not just advocating for herself. She was advocating for all “creators – a goal I’m never going to stop trying to help achieve,” Swift wrote.

Don’t make everything all about you. Think about how you can support your community of colleagues. Does your industry need fairer pay, health insurance, better parental leave benefits, professional development training or commuter assistance? You can add value in smaller ways like pushing for support of a colleague’s project. Identify something that you care about, and have the confidence to speak up about it. When you increase the power of others, you increase the power of everyone, including yourself.

3. Thank the people that got you to where you are today.

Taylor Swift thanked the record executive at her previous label, Big Machine, and her fans. Swift knows she is talented. She also knows that she would not be where she is today without other people appreciating her talent and supporting her career.

Always show appreciation to your colleagues. Rarely do you build a successful career alone. The more respect you show for your supporters, the more respect they will continue to give to you.

Make a deal with yourself to develop your power and use it. Recognize your value, advocate for others and give thanks. Advancing your career along with the careers of others is the most rewarding deal of all.

"As entrepreneurs, we'd like to be super smart and have the skill sets we need to take care of every aspect of our business -- marketing, sales, operations, and more.

But here's the thing: entrepreneurs are human, just like everyone else. We make mistakes. We stumble from time to time. And there are plenty of things that we don't know.

Take Richard Branson, for example. He was being interviewed by the Financial Times back in 2010, and when asked: ""Have you ever lied at work?"", Branson confessed that he didn't know the difference between net profits and gross profits for years.

If you come from a business background (or you've taken some sort of accounting course), you'll know that these two terms are pretty simple. Simple enough, in fact, that any business student would know them.

But, hey, Richard Branson wasn't one of those entrepreneurs who went to college and graduated with a shiny business degree before starting up a company. He's dyslexic, and he quit school at 16 to run his first company.

How Branson's employee pulled him aside to explain the 2 terms

Branson said he thought he hid his confusion well, but in retrospect, it was obvious to his team members that he didn't know what was going on. (He used to ask if the numbers presented meant good or bad news, and that was definitely a telling sign.)

One day, an executive took him aside, and explained the terms to him. They drew a diagram of a net in the sea, and told him to think of the fish outside the net as gross profits, and the fish in the net as net profits. Branson was in his 50s at that point; for the first time in his life, he finally understood the difference between the two terms.

Richard Branson recently blogged about how there's no shame in admitting ""the places where (we) may fall short"", and asking for help. As he puts it, as long as you're honest with yourself, you can learn a lot.

Personally, I couldn't agree more. When I first started building my company, I did it with a clear understanding of my strengths and weaknesses: I was good at marketing, sales, and team building, but I had zero organizational skills.

To compensate for this, I decided to come up with processes and systems that I could follow, and hire someone who could keep things organized. In my early years, I asked my mentors for advice on how to build the right systems and process to scale my business.

Later on, when I had the budget, I hired consultants to improve these systems even further. On top of that, I also hired an assistant to help me keep my emails and calendar organized.

The moral of the story

Here's the key takeaway: it pays to be self-aware. Once you understand your strengths and weaknesses, you can take the necessary steps to make up for your weaknesses, and ask for help when needed. Stop feeling as though you need to be the biggest guy (or woman!) in the room, because you don't.",
"It's no secret that we unfortunately make snap judgments about others based on how they look. Now, though, for the first time, psychology researchers have pinpointed exactly what people might think of your personality based solely on what your body type is like.

Led by Ying Hu of the University of Texas at Dallas, the study used laser scanning of human bodies to create 140 male and female 3D body models. Then the researchers had 76 participants check out the models from two angles and pick which of 30 personality traits from the Big Five domains (extraversion, agreeableness, neuroticisim, openness to experience and conscientiousness) applied to them. Based on the labeling, the researchers could predict how people would judge models with specific combinations of characteristics.

The study findings revealed that there's a big range of stereotypical judgments people can make about your appearance when small differences in body type are present. The key findings, however, showed that

The study does have some caveats. The researchers didn't account for elements like age or culture, for example. Additionally, as Amanda Mull points out in her article for The Atlantic, the connection between personality and body types has a shaky history, with many of the stereotypes revealed in Hu's study grounded in scientifically debunked ideas originating from psychologist William Sheldon.

With these elements in mind, conscious and subconscious biases based on body type or other physical factors can influence important business areas like hiring, networking and giving an effective presentation. And as Hu told Mull, one of the hopes for the study was to raise awareness of the stereotypes and how unreliable they truly are. If you understand the basic assumptions you're up against, you're in a heck of a lot better position to create company policies and procedures that are fairer for everybody.

But it goes beyond your personal business operations. You can dig deeper and ask yourself what the origin of the stereotype really is and what the facts are behind it. For example, research shows that overweight people often have lower incomes and struggle to have access to healthy, lower-calorie diets. Fixing that would mean addressing much bigger problems, such as education gaps and complex economic factors that influence how much companies can pay workers. Once you grasp these wider connections, you can take a bigger leadership role as a social advocate, lobbying for wider, positive cultural changes. After all, if you've got some influence, there's more to do with your time than just make money.",
"General Motors made a large and stunning announcement today, confirming roughly 15% of its global workforce will be terminated or bought out. More than 14,000 people will be out of a job in 2019 or earlier including 25% of executives.

Under the guise of a rather positive sounding press release, “General Motors Accelerates Transformation,” company chairman and CEO Mary Barra said, “The actions we are taking today continue our transformation to be highly agile, resilient and profitable, while giving us the flexibility to invest in the future.”

Seven plants will be shuttered with total cash savings resulting in $6 billion through cost reductions and lower capital expenditures.

Barra’s comments continued: “We recognize the need to stay in front of changing market conditions and customer preferences to position our company for long-term success.”

One of Barra’s predecessors was Charles E. Wilson, CEO of General Motors between 1941 and 1953. During confirmation hearings before a Senate Committee in 1952—where Wilson was still CEO of the company—he responded to a question about conflicts of interest by Senator Robert Hendrickson as follows:

“For years I thought that what was good for our country was good for General Motors, and vice versa. The difference did not exist. Our company is too big. It goes with the welfare of the country.”

Perhaps Wilson’s comments were a harbinger for 2019.

Tucked away in GM’s press release announcing the closures was a signal—indeed a potent portent—for the current White House administration to consider: “GM now intends to prioritize future vehicle investments in its next-generation battery-electric architectures.”

It is the sound of both innovation and sustainability.

While Tesla gets an inordinate amount of mainstream media press as it continues to accelerate “the world's transition to sustainable energy with electric cars, solar panels and integrated renewable energy solutions,” slowly and quietly organizations like GM are being forced to do the same. It’s the 2018 version of kill or be killed.

When a company the size of GM—with more than $145 billion in annual revenues—is forced to lay off 14,000 people while shuttering seven of its plants, I wonder if the White House sees the connection to Wilson’s quote some 65 years ago.

“It goes with the welfare of the country,” said Wilson, which should frighten any senior member of Trump’s administration. America has taken far too long to curb its dependence on oil. The same might be said concerning an overreliance on all non-renewable resources.

And now—demonstrated by the example of GM—more than 14,000 people are out of work as the company tries to expedite its “next-generation battery-electric architectures.”

Who might be next?

What large organization with thousands of employees will be issuing a press release in 2019 announcing its plans to shave the workforce? What large organization will realize that its own strategy needs updating—and in an expedited fashion—such that it does not perish? What organization is currently reading the tea leaves of an old-fashioned, outdated approach to business?

I see Wilson’s comment not only as a harbinger but a renewed call for the White House and leaders from all levels of government to incentivize companies. Organizations need to expedite their innovation such that sustainable means of operating becomes the norm.

When the organization’s plans finally change, perhaps the workforce can be retrained (and retained) rather than terminated so they might be part of the solution, and assist the transformation.",
"On November 10th, “On Her Shoulders” screened at America’s largest documentary festival, DOC NYC. The film follows 23-year-old Nadia Murad’s journey from a survivor of the 2014 Yazidi genocide by ISIS in Iraq to a harrowing global voice against human rights violations, putting a face to the atrocities of war crimes.

Since 2015, Murad has been on a mission to bring ISIS before the International Criminal Court on charges of genocide and crimes against humanity. Her activism has brought her to global acclaim. In 2016, she was named the UN’s first Goodwill Ambassador for the Dignity of Survivors of Human Trafficking. That same year, she founded “Nadia’s Initiative,” an organization that ""advocates for victims of sexual violence and works to rebuild communities in crisis,” and challenges world leaders to ""push past the status quo and assume a responsibility to act — to make “never again” a reality, not an empty promise.”

In October, Murad was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize alongside Congolese gynecologist Denis Mukwege for their fight against sexual violence. Awarding her the prize, the Nobel Committee recounted the details of her story and applauded her heroism: “Nadia Murad is one of an estimated 3,000 Yazidi girls and women who were victims of rape and other abuses by the IS army. The abuses were systematic and part of a military strategy. They served as a weapon in the fight against Yazidis and other religious minorities... She has shown uncommon courage in recounting her own sufferings and speaking up on behalf of other victims.”

In her autobiography, “The Last Girl: The Story of Captivity, and My Fight Against the Islamic State” Murad details the horrors of her capture and sexual enslavement. “My story, told honestly and matter-of-factly, is the best weapon I have against terrorism, and I plan on using it until those terrorists are put on trial. There is still so much that needs to be done.”

Murad’s traumatic experience is heartbreaking. Unfortunately, it’s not unique.

During conflict, sexual violence is often used as a weapon of war

Around the world, emergencies, displacement and conflict place girls and women at increased risk of sexual assault and abuse. Often separated from their families and communities, they’re particularly vulnerable to gender-based violence.

It was not until 2008 that the United Nations formally recognized the sexual violence against women during conflict as a war crime. UNICEF is devoted to the protection of girls and women who are vulnerable to such crimes and to helping those who have been brutalized during ethnic cleansing campaigns.

UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, has voiced acute concern of underreporting the sexual violence of asylum seekers because survivors are overwhelmed and reluctant to report assaults out of fear, hopelessness, shame, discrimination or retaliation. For instance, Rohingya refugee women told UNICEF researchers that they are afraid to leave their makeshift shelters in the refugee camps because of the stigma associated with sexual violence. For those victims who have faced stigmatization, UNICEF is dedicated to policy reform to avert prejudice of sexual violence victims.

At this year’s UN General Assembly, UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta H. Fore pronounced that children and women are under attack. Speaking out for the millions of women and girls trapped in humanitarian emergencies, Fore called on the international community to join UNICEF in the fight to end gender-based violence in emergencies. ""Let us honor their courage with our investment,"" she said."" And let us match their determination with our best efforts to transform the tragedies they’ve endured into the protection, hope and opportunity they deserve.”

UNICEF knows that sexual violence can destroy communities the way few weapons can. UNICEF aims to protect children and women around the world from violence, exploitation and abuse. Please donate now to support UNICEF's programs.",None
"One strategy I use when keynote speaking is to make sure I follow those who have blazed the trail, are blazing the trail and who will blaze the trail. I call it my 10/10/10 list.

I keep tabs on 10 speakers in each category. Try it in your industry to see what you can do to be more innovative and competitive in your field.

Looking at those on my list, I recently started getting a feeling of being… jealous. Jealous? I am not a jealous person! This instantly got me thinking—why would I feel jealous vs. inspired by these leaders in my industry?

First, we have to define the two words. What’s the difference between jealousy and inspiration? By definition…

Jealousy is feeling or showing envy toward someone or their achievements and advantages. (Going deeper, envy is the feeling of discontented or resentful longing aroused by someone else's possessions, qualities or luck.)

Inspiration is the process of being mentally stimulated to do or feel something, especially to do something creative.

So, why was I feeling jealous vs. inspired? Although it’s hard to admit, the reason was… me. As difficult as this is to say—as this article will live on the internet forever and as I myself deliver motivational keynotes—my mental state over the past few weeks has been negative.

Lately, I’ve had waves of getting hit (mentally) in business, spending time in the hospital, missing out on some big contracts and even personally annoying things such as an unexpected $2,000 bill for a broken water heater. All of that, plus working to be the husband and dad who carries a lot of the responsibilities at home. I know I’m not alone in this because life serves up surprises for us all.

When I look back at the times I’ve been inspired, it’s been when my personal life is thriving. I’m mentally stimulated in a positive way. I’m inspired when I have been talking to myself positively, I have confidence in my content and when I “know” I can do it even with no previous experience in the area. But lately, I have been swinging BIG with launching new products and keynotes and developing my new TV show, and it has caused me to have some hits and major misses. Every day seems like a roller coaster of emotions.

When I feel jealous, it’s because I feel mentally exhausted, tired and stressed and have been knocked down a few times—OK, maybe a lot of times—especially this past week.

I got a therapist. I also got a personal trainer and nutritionist to help with my diet and to keep me active. I hadn’t worked out in three weeks. I mean I am an IRONMAN (and that’s what I would tell myself, which ultimately would make me feel guilty, and that guilt would lead me to not work out). I also talked with my business coach and opened up about the hard times. And I have had some real talks with my wife and family, letting them know how I have been feeling and that I needed some help.

Here’s the kicker: I’ve launched some really big initiatives this month and am working on some really big projects, and they have been going great. People have been super helpful, encouraging and uplifting—giving me hand-ups, connections and even investing in my projects.

Because things were also going so well, I felt like I shouldn’t look at the things that were not going so well at the same time. I believed I could handle things myself. I believed that I should focus on the good and bury the bad. But I quickly learned…

My self-belief that I should handle this by myself was causing me to self-destruct. So, I got a lot of outside help so I could start working on me.

As my favorite author Thich Nhat Hanh says, “When we suffer in our personal lives, our professional lives also suffer.”

In today’s business world, we can all do a better job of talking nicer to ourselves, getting outside help and knowing we don’t have to do this alone. It’s also important to understand that it’s okay to experience your highest highs and lows at the same time.

Those of us who are inspired create better products, find stronger solutions and deliver more impactful keynotes. We don’t need jealous leaders. Our world needs inspiration more than ever!

It’s okay to be doing amazing things and feeling like you’re winning often yet still have tough times. My biggest home runs sometimes come with the biggest sucker punches to the gut. Business and life are hard. But we are strong. We are capable. We are leaders.

What is one thing you can do to switch your jealousy to inspiration today? Get started!",
"As we close out 2018, you may be taking stock and asking yourself big questions: What do I want? What changes do I need to make to support that? And how do I continue to grow?

Though your answers may be fuzzy, there is one proven strategy that will provide clarity to elevate your life and career: serving others.

Does this mean that you need to transform into a completely selfless being? Not exactly, but you might need to shift your mindset to one of enlightened self-interest, or one in which you believe that consistently helping others in a meaningful way will in the long run also help you.

Practicing this mindset strengthens your relationships, demonstrates your expertise, builds your credibility, and earns you the trust of others. All of these will bring you lasting benefits, even though you earn them by serving others.

Here are three easy ways to incorporate enlightened self-interest into your everyday routine:

1. Strive to provide value in every interaction, no matter what.

Overhear a frazzled co-worker searching for answers in an area where you're an expert? Suggest to him an informed solution. Is your client struggling with a choice between products?  Suggest the best (not necessarily priciest) option for her needs. Notice the stranger ahead of you at the coffee shop has forgotten her wallet? Buy her latte. Make a conscious choice to up your awareness and seek opportunities to help others for the pure joy of providing value, without the expectation of reciprocity. Remember, enlightened self-interest isn't about keeping score, it's about the belief that in the long run, you will be better off by practicing it. Make it your goal to enhance every situation, every encounter, every environment because of your involvement.

Raise your hand if you look forward to having your social media feeds filled with advertisements and offers from experts touting their talents — anyone? Rather than blatantly self-promote on social media, use your words to share your wisdom. Offer the learnings and insights gleaned from your experiences to help serve others. When you consistently do this, you'll build your credibility and demonstrate your expertise, naturally drawing others to you.

Long before a deal is made between two parties, a relationship is established. Ask yourself if you view someone as a partner or a vendor? Are they a valued member of your community or a means to an end? You must shift your perception. If that relationship is rooted in trust, respect, and service, it will endure (as will future sales). If that relationship is treated as a mere transaction, it will never see the light of day and likely fizzle out before a sale is ever made. In the world of enlightened self-interest, connections with others are highly valued—and always come first.

When you focus on serving others, you're doing your part to create a kinder, more positive world. You'll bolster your relationships, build your credibility, and showcase your expertise to earn the trust of others.

And the best part? You'll not only elevate your life, but also the lives of those around you.",
"Walking into the discrete offices of Dosist in Santa Monica feels more like walking into the offices of a design studio than a cannabis company - all sleek lines and wooden walls. It is as good a metaphor as any as to how Dosist (formerly Hmbldt) has from the beginning had the intention of re-defining the category of cannabis from its frequently garish and frat-boy image into something more mature and sophisticated. Dosist differentiates itself from the rest of the industry through several clever innovations: its products contain carefully formulated strains of cannabis that are sold under the desired need states: 'Calm', 'Sleep', 'Bliss' for instance are some of the product names, allowing consumers new to the market to identify what they want instead of having to guess what strain delivers what effect. Another innovation is the Dosist pen itself, which Time Magazine called one of its best 25 inventions in 2016, for its ability to use tactile feedback that vibrates when the user has inhaled for three seconds, allowing for carefully calibrated dosing–often a problem for new users as well. Not to mention the brand's Apple-esque design and packaging which eschews gothic fonts and lurid graphics for something altogether more minimalist and aspirational.

Indeed, Apple comes up frequently in conversations with CEO Gunner Winston who says he wants to create a 'Forever Brand' inspired by the likes of Starbucks, Nike and the giant from Cupertino. The intention is to create a 'modern wellness company', one that offers a natural alternative to the addictive opioids often promoted by the pharmaceutical industry. He talked about his decision to leave his comfortable retirement after a career in finance and join the company, first as an investor and then as a CEO. ""First, I was inspired by the narrative which is one where in the world of cannabis, where everyone talks about recreation and intoxication, Dosist from the start narrates around science, innovation and empowering people to naturally manage their health and happiness. That's a powerful narrative that transcends the space of cannabis. The way we look at it is there's cannabis and there's Dosist, just like there was coffee and Starbucks, sneakers and  Nike, consumer electronics and Apple. The greatest brands transcend categories. They don't operate within the confines of their category. And that's why our mission of 'empowering people to naturally manage their health and happiness' is a big platform.”

We talked about what it means to create a 'modern wellness company' especially as America grapples with an opioid crisis. “When I think about wellness, wellness is mental. Wellness is physical. Obviously, the word ‘wellness’ is evolving and very commonly used. But we're here to help you change the narrative of how you connect with managing your mental moments. When you have an injury, you normally have to take some type of prescription pill or opioid. So we have this situation where opioids and prescription pills are a challenge for everyone. People are looking for answers. But what is dynamic about the conversations is that when you have sleep issues, you will do almost anything to find the solution, which is why people take Ambien. And if you have pain, Percocet and Vicodin work–but the side effects are the challenge. What are your alternatives - to not do it because then you don't perform? And that's why what I like about 'wellness' is that it does help you perform better - whether it's from meditating or working out, it's all one big cycle in a holistic conversation. That's why we think we're 'wellness' because we're part of the solution, not the only solution.”

Dosist is now expanding outside of California for the first time, partnering with Surterra to launch the brand in Florida. Winston talks about the decision to 'grow slow' and the strategy behind the expansion. “I have a chance to be part of something so impactful in many individual's lives - which is why we prioritize the brand and the business before revenues and profits, always. Most people have heard about cannabis being about the 'Green Rush'. We don't rush. What are we rushing for? We're rushing to be great, but great doesn't connect with the size of your business. Our narrative is really being good at everything we do. That takes time. If we were trying to make the most money, I would speed this up. I'd be in twenty states. We've been in one state for two years. Why? If you’re looking at great brands, historically, Starbucks was in Washington for years before Howard Schultz took them to the next state. Shake Shack was in New York for six years before they left. We're here to get this right which means giving the best product possible for consumers and patients. Now we want to grow and our goal is to grow globally. But that's not based on someone else's time frame. So now that we've earned the right to grow in California by building awareness and conversion, we've announced Florida. Our brand narrative is to inspire, to educate and engage. So we just operate like a forever brand - we don't operate like a brand that is trying to sell in two to three years to XYZ company or to go public. I'm not saying neither those will happen, it’s just not how we wake up every single day.”

Winston has found a sense of personal purpose in joining Dosist that he says he never really felt in his previous careers. “I did this because I'm in a space where I can really change history. So think about this for a second: when you have issues around sleep or you have issues around anxiety that doctor tells you Ambien or Xanax, it's almost formulaic. Boom, you had that problem–here's a solution: prescription drugs. When most people hear about cannabis, most will go ‘either I do or don't’. It's a hard line. Dosist is repackaging it in a way that's far more approachable but also taking the guesswork out of cannabis. So when I had a chance to be a part of changing people's lives, literally changing how you connect with your personal healthcare, I couldn't pass it up.”",
"With one of the most difficult political jobs in the world at the moment, being attacked from all sides, a torturous lack of sleep, little or no time to reflect and re-energise, how can Theresa May dig deep and find the passion to light up her performance and win over her Cabinet, the Commons and the country?

Caroline Goyder - author of Gravitas and voice coach to actors, CEOs, news reporters and even a monarch - shares her top tips for May’s performances during these challenging times.

“A leader needs to win hearts and minds and this can only be done when more passion is injected into performances,” explains Caroline.  ""When you find the balance between head and heart, your gravitas really kicks in.”

Leadership is, in essence, about going somewhere and taking people with you, and that requires two things - energy and direction. Theresa May’s 'safe pair of hands' pragmatic style is ""in danger of being overused,"" says Caroline. ""Her voice and delivery reflect the relentlessness of her job, dogged determination and constant pushing through."" Caroline adds: ""Its flat tonality lacks a sense of energy that she needs to engage us."" Cicero wrote of the need to balance “vehemence” with “gentleness” and in Mrs May’s case, Caroline explains, we could do with hearing both the language and tonality of hope to balance her seriousness.

So, with the almost impossible weight of Brexit on May's shoulders, what are Caroline’s top tips for a passionate performance?

Caroline worked for over a decade at Royal Central School of Speech and Drama in London as a voice coach. She is the author of Gravitas: Communicate with Confidence, Influence and Authority (Ebury) and Star Qualities (Macmillan). Her 2014 TEDx on the Surprising Secret to Speaking with Confidence has been viewed over 6 million times. Caroline speaks regularly at Henley Business School, School of Life and London Business Forum. Clients have included news anchors and reporters, actors, CEOs of FTSE 100 and 250 companies, a monarch and TV magicians, amongst others.",
"Charrlotte De'Davis changed her first name by deed poll, inserting a second R to honor her Ghanaian grandmother. Former Spice Girl Geri Halliwell simply changed hers by marriage to Geri Horner.

Now the founder of Bardou Beauty and the former Spice Girl are both focused on R-words.

For De’Davis, it is telling disadvantaged girls and women to always remember to be themselves. For Horner, it’s the reunion of four-fifths of the world’s most famous girl band for a UK tour.

The two got together recently when Horner hosted a charity gala and auction organised by The Bardou Foundation, a social enterprise set up by De’Davis’s beauty business with aims to champion women and girls and help shape their professional futures.

At the event to represent The Prince’s Trust charity, Horner told a star-studded guest list: “There are too many young people who don’t have access to the right support.”

Held on International Day of the Girl Child, the event, at the original Mayfair home of London’s iconic Annabel’s private member’s club, raised £71,000 for eight charities devoted to empowering girls and women.

In between entertainment by a snake dancer and West End opera tenor Tim Rogers, awards were given to Marisa Peer for her work through the #iamenough movement and Bollywood star Amy Jackson for her achievements as a role model and work for the Sneha Sagar Orphanage in India.

For De’Davis, a former events management professional who spent weeks organising the event, there is a clear link between the business ethos of her company and the goals of its foundation.

Her beauty business began as a hair brand, set up three years ago with Aidee Phelan, the celebrity hairdresser who came up with David Beckham’s blond-streak mohawk haircut before the 2002 soccer World Cup.

They opened a number of pop-up blow-dry bars in the UK, including a site in London’s Covent Garden, but struggled with high rents and local taxes.

Phelan stepped out of the business to focus back on men’s hair, while De’Davis concentrated on women’s beauty products, such as dry shampoo and eyebrow gels.

Now she is launching a beauty spa and services brand called Bardou Beauty and plans a beauty academy focusing on training girls and women in the industry.

“Bardou Beauty is an ethically-driven beauty lifestyle brand looking to challenge the widespread belief that beauty is only skin deep and the fact that for beauty brands the bottom line is, well…the bottom line,” she says.

”We strongly believe that a woman is at her most beautiful when she feels confident, empowered and strong and we want to support and empower women to find, embrace and enhance their own meaning of beauty.”

De’Davis, who says she has an “absolute passion for helping young girls and women,” is also seeking to refocus efforts to empower them on core values.

Much of this work is focused through The Bardou Foundation, launched last year at an event hosted by actor Idris Elba as a social enterprise focused on improving the lives of underprivileged girls and women.

“From my own experiences, I recognize the inequality problem that we speak about when it comes to girls and women,” she says.

”A lot of the focus has been on financial equality but I want to focus on values.

”For Bardou Beauty, for example, it’s all about having an impact on society.

”It’s about helping girls, some of whom come from horrific situations, build confidence, have hope, get into the beauty industry and know that they have support.”

For De’Davis, the business and foundation both pay tribute to the leadership tips she received from her grandmother who recommended keratin and shea butter for hair care but left a deeper personal message etched on Bardou’s memory.

”She looked into my eyes and said to always remember to be myself,” she recalls. “These were her three foundations of the beauty that I always saw in her.

”My current products contain keratin and my future ones will have shea butter so there's a lot of inspiration from my grandmother residing in my products, business and philanthropy.

”I was named Charlotte after her and I guess I have taken a lot of her traits because I am at my happiest whenever what I am doing is positively impacting people’s lives.”",
"The best leaders I know share a common and under-appreciated “superpower.” It isn’t being the smartest person in the room, and it definitely isn’t magically having all the answers. Many of best motivators share something else in common: they are willing to poke fun at themselves in order to disarm, build trust and create a safe environment. They are unashamed to admit that they, too, have flaws and make mistakes.

In short, their philosophy is: never look too good or talk too smart.

Let me illustrate the point with the story of “Pete Planchock, the Preacher Pitchman.”

Pete was the second person I hired in my career. He ran our General Motors-Fanuc Robotics’ West Coast office and set himself apart right away as an exceptional public speaker. He would stand in front of a room and, in no time, have the audience hanging on every word. I nicknamed him the “preacher pitchman” because he was such an inspiring speaker and was never without, what he called, “the 30 pound pitch” which consisted of a huge black leather briefcase full of sales presentations that sounded like a set of barbells hitting the pavement when he amused us by simply releasing it from his hand.

One day we were driving together to visit a prospective customer outside of Los Angeles. When we got in Pete’s car and the radio came on, I was surprised to hear that it was tuned to a religious radio station and a minister was preaching with fervor.

Pete was pretty tough looking. He had done a stint as a roughneck on an oil patch. I figured him as more of a rock-and-roll kind of guy. So, I said, “Pete, what are you listening to?” With a glimmer in his eye, he said, “I'm doing research.” Then out of the blue he says, “Did you hear that? He said ‘ain’t!’”

I was flummoxed. “What in the heck are you talking about?” I asked, completely mystified. Then I heard the truth about Pete.

None of us would ever have guessed it, but Pete admitted to me that when we hired him, he knew he was going to have to do a lot more public speaking as part of the job—and this was something that terrified him. So he figured he would learn how to do it better from the best speakers around: the folks who stood up in the pulpit and gave a sermon every Sunday. Pete told me how he spent months moving from church to church to learn from the best speakers and copy their styles.

I was blown away. So I asked Pete if there was anything the best speakers had in common. “Yes,” he said. “They never look too good or talk too smart.” And as we drove along listening to the radio, he pointed out again and again how the speakers would use their own slip-ups and failings to connect with their listeners.

What Pete taught me that day is that the most inspirational people out there understand that being authentic and real—and yes, flawed—is one of the most important elements of leadership . We all know that nobody is perfect. Why should we expect leaders to be different?

Now here’s a very important distinction: I’m not talking about pretending to have flaws to manipulate people and make yourself more likable. Believe me, we all have plenty of genuine imperfections. I’m talking about being willing to be honest about your true shortcomings.

After all, why pretend? The truth will come out. Probably is out already anyway. So why keep playing this game when the real key to building a high-performance team is to establish the kind of safe environment where everyone is willing to admit their flaws and even have some fun with it.

Showing vulnerability by admitting your failures builds trust in others. This is one of the foundations for building lasting relationships. And the more vulnerable and authentic you are right from the start, the quicker you can build trust. This is what I affectionately call “Planchock's Law of Authenticity.”

It’s this authenticity that is the under-appreciated “super-power” of some of the best leaders I’ve known over the course of my career. They weren’t great because they were the most articulate or had the highest IQ.

We live in an age where we think we need to hold ourselves to superhero standards in order to lead. Can someone who is flawed, just like the rest of us, inspire? Shouldn’t we aim to be better than that, or do our best to hide our true selves so we’re always setting a shining example?

Funny, but that’s the key to understanding why never looking too good or talking too smart is actually the overlooked superpower of leadership.

Great leadership is grounded in the idea that people need to be inspired, not driven to attain perfection.  We want to be coached, not rescued, with the freedom to push ourselves further without the fear of failure. And that all begins by setting an example that, yes, we’re all in the same boat. Imperfect. When you toss out that fear of not being perfect, that’s when the real magic can happen.

Next time you find yourself standing in front of a crowd, don’t pretend to be perfect or have all the answers. Chances are everybody already knows your flaws, fears and failures or they soon will, so why not admit it? Have fun with it. “Mock yourself out.” A self-deprecating sense of humor is a superpower and a key to being an authentic leader.

"According to Fitbit CFO Ronald Kisling, “Too much data can be just as useless as too little data.” He raises a good point. In the financial field, CFOs are tasked with digesting endless data to make tough decisions that ultimately affect price points and investment opportunities. At Fitbit, however, the finance team has found a way to effectively pinpoint relevant data to back necessary strategic decisions. This month, I connected with Kisling to learn more about taking advantage of data analytics to drive team understanding and capitalize on industry trends.

Jeff Thomson: You have nearly 35 years of financial leadership experience, having served as the CFO of several public and private technology companies. How has your perspective on finance and accounting evolved over your career, especially given the impact technology is currently having on the profession?

Ronald Kisling: Technology has certainly impacted finance organizations. The automation of transaction processing has dramatically increased the efficiency of finance teams and allowed smaller teams to support larger organizations. At the same time, it has significantly increased the amount of information and data available. Managing all that data and driving meaningful and actionable reporting for the business continues to be a challenge.

Thomson: The role of data in the finance function is expanding rapidly. How does the finance team use data to help inform recommendations at Fitbit? How can data analytics be used to predict what price increases consumers will be willing to absorb?

Kisling: Technology can help us improve our efficiency and scale as an organization. The increased availability of data can also help us understand what is occurring in the business and enable everyone to focus on the right things. With the vast amount of data that is available, it is even more important for a finance team to identify the data and information that is relevant to what is happening in the business and present it in a way that drives understanding of relevant trends. Too much data can be just as useless as too little data.

We also keep a pulse on consumer trends research and regularly solicit feedback from our own users to understand evolving expectations in the wearables market. What we’ve learned is that our users have varying preferences – from form factor to feature set and of course, price. Accessible price points are one of our key differentiators. Our mission is to make everyone in the world healthier but to do that, the products, software and services that help achieve this goal must be affordable, so we’ll continue to balance our price points with our vision.

Thomson: The wearables industry is a highly-competitive market, with companies like Apple and Samsung also creating products. What do you feel the financial outlook is for the wearables category and what do you think Fitbit’s opportunity is in this space?

Kisling: The wearable device market is very healthy, with IDC forecasting an expected compound annual growth rate of 11.6 percent through 2022. With continued technology innovation, including a growing utility for applications in healthcare, we believe the market will continue to grow with demand for both smartwatches and trackers.

We see the wearables opportunity as one where many other companies can be successful too. Over the past eleven years, Fitbit has created a powerful brand that consumers love and return to time and again for their health and fitness needs. Our ability to provide them with choice has been incredibly important – offering a range of products at different price points has been key to our success.

That success is evident in our performance. We’re now the number two player in the smartwatch category in the U.S. less than 14 months after entering it – outselling Samsung, Garmin and Fossil. Our most recent product, the Charge 3, is the top-selling Android device in the U.S., underscoring a continued demand for trackers. Our ability to innovate and continue to deliver products and experiences that users love will help drive our success going forward.

Thomson: Fitbit has been able to successfully transition from a smartwatch company to a health and wellness brand, offering healthcare and digital health tracking. You also have experience with transitions, recently moving from a chief accounting officer role to CFO within the company. What were the additional skills you had to acquire to make this transition successful? How do you navigate change and what would you tell others facing significant changes in their professional lives?

Kisling: My experience as a CFO in other public technology companies provided me with a great deal of experience that has helped prepare me to take on this new role at Fitbit. As the company’s chief accounting officer, my initial responsibility was to build a finance team that would support a public company and then to scale our finance and IT organizations and drive operational execution across the company. This role was primarily internally focused. Now as CFO, I am much more involved in strategy and vision, working with the investor community to achieve our stated goals of returning to growth and profitability while also extending our reach into healthcare and growing our non-device revenues.

Thomson: Additionally, what are your goals as the new CFO? How do you plan to help the company return to profitability?

Kisling: I’m incredibly focused on making sure we execute our transition plan. This means ensuring we as a team at Fitbit are aligned on our goals and focused on execution. We are constantly looking at how we drive greater efficiency and improve our resource utilization as a business. That focus was reflected in our most recent quarter, as we drove our operating expenses down by 17 percent over the prior year. I’m also focused on making the right choices on our investments that support growth in the wearable space, extending our reach into healthcare and growing our software and services business – all of which are critical for our success in delivering our vision to make the world healthier.",
"Nathan Testa founded Teko Corporation, a full-service digital agency that offers website and app development as well as marketing and branding services, in 2016. He was 17 years old. Since that time, he has taken his company global by forming a collaborative partnership with Indus Net Technologies, an IT firm based in Asia. As the head of the Australian operations, Testa manages a team of 15 employees in delivering innovative digital strategies to clients.

In spite of the fact that he began coding at age 12, Testa doesn’t believe he was born an entrepreneur. Rather he says he was influenced by his parents and grandparents, who ran businesses throughout their lives. They encouraged him to think outside the box, even supporting his decision to drop out of high school at age 16 in order to focus on building his own company.

Testa offers these tips for young people who want to start their own business.

It is critical to begin your journey with a sense of purpose. Ask yourself why you want to go down the path you have chosen. Is it for financial freedom? Is it to pursue something you love? These are important questions to ask yourself. Having a purpose will help you reach your goals.

You must do your homework and spend as much time as possible developing your business blueprint. The blueprint can be summed up with one word: Sustainability. What distinguishes your business from others? Why should customers buy your product or service? Price is not always the buyer’s prime consideration. Take a moment to consider the perceived value you bring to the table. What unique benefit will the customer receive from you?

Develop a roadmap so that you understand where you are now, where you want to go, and how you are going to get there. It doesn’t have to be incredibly detailed, but it should highlight key areas. The plan acts as the benchmark or checkpoint. As you travel along building your business, stop from time to time and check where you are to ensure you are still following the right path.

Critical to success in business is understanding the numbers. Not all business owners are financially literate – and therein lies the problem. I decided to use a cloud-based accounting system to maintain financial information. This helped me understand my business, whilst also enabling me to invite advisors such as accountants and business financiers to view my system and guide me in better managing my business.

Having an entrepreneurial flair, although exciting and rewarding, can also be a lonely journey. Being around a vibrant community of like-minded people will help you to no end. Keep yourself surrounded by people who have a vision and are as goal-oriented as you are. Ideally, find people you can bounce ideas off of, and whom you trust to provide honest feedback. One great place to find such people is at your local co-working space.

Testa got his start in coding because he was “curious about technology – how it worked and what it could do.” During childhood, he spent “a great deal of time” playing interactive video games. Then his father asked Testa to help him create a website for his accounting firm and promote the business via social media. Testa leaped at the chance to test his abilities and see if he could help his father’s company stand out online.

Indeed, Testa’s efforts proved a success – so much so that his father’s business contacts starting hiring Testa to do their web development and online promotional work. He continued to build his digital expertise from that point on, launching his own company shortly thereafter.

Testa feels that his true life purpose isn’t so much about mastering technology as it is about encouraging other young entrepreneurs to pursue their dreams. “I interact with many entrepreneurs who are relatively young in years but mature in mind. I find that often they have chosen to do what they do because of a deep burning desire to pursue something they’re passionate about. They’re driven by purpose, and the monetary benefits seem to be the last thing on their minds. I enjoy helping – if in a relatively small way – by answering their questions and concerns. I act as a sounding board. I enjoy guiding people in launching successful businesses in an age of rapidly changing technology.”",
"It’s no secret the larger the business the slower the movement. As the more laid back generation makes its final exit and the digital-driven generation takes the wheel, businesses are having to reframe their workplace policies to meet the needs of their new workers. The greatest obstacle businesses face is releasing the grip on outdated workplace formalities and creating policies that support the new generation.

Employers are losing out on top talent by retaining antiquated workplace policies. The truth is, companies need to be constantly evolving and shifting with the needs of the workplace to remain competitive. According to research done by Catalyst, millennials are the largest working generation and by 2025 will make up three-quarters of the workforce. Catalyst also states, post-millennials, known as Generation Z, currently make up 5% of the workforce with rapid growth to soon takeover.

Traditional workplace rules that worked for previous generations no longer remain relevant to newer ones. The negative consequences associated with the resistance to change far outweigh the mentality of if it’s not broke, don’t fix it. Relinquishing outdated workplace rules and fostering a culture that speaks to the new generation will keep them engaged, loyal and productive.

Here are four outdated rules that are stalling business growth and holding companies back from being greater than what they are.

The greatest challenge employers face is dealing with employees facing personal issues. The reality is, everybody handles issues differently and while some are great at storing them away when they clock in, others are too emotionally attached. Someone can only push the cork down in the water for so long before it pops back up, and it always pops back up.

The traditional work-life balance that emphasized work and neglected life is becoming extinct . Employees want a blend, not a balance. They understand work-life boundaries are essential but they want to loosen the barriers, between management and employees, creating a transparent workplace with open and fluid communication. Managers are now taking on the coaching role and creating valuable partnerships with their employees.

It’s crucial for managers to set boundaries in their working relationships. Employers should not double as an employees therapist, but they should be available to lean on to coach employees through a challenge helping them to refocus. Some solutions can be encouraging the employee to take some time off, utilize their employee assistance program or providing support to solve performance issues.

Companies are finding it challenging to understand the need for flexibility. Even though email and messenger services are the main vehicle of internal communication, employers prefer to have all members of their team physically present in the office. Companies want to maximize their expenses. If they’re paying for the office space they want the space to be filled.

Age-old working methods require employees to abide by strict policies that stifle their creativity keeping them confined to their office cubicles. Employees receive little to no leniency on these rules and face write-ups as a consequence abiding strictly by the three strikes and you’re out progressive discipline policy. Imposing a blanket starting time for all employees to be present at their desks with little wiggle room creates a limitation in flexibility. Blanket policies are a great guideline but should be personalized for each individual situation.

The explosion of startups and tech companies has shown when employees are given the freedom to make decisions and own their results, they’re more creative. Google has yielded some of the most innovative platforms due to employees having the creative freedom to manage their own time effectively using the 80/20 rule. When people are valued it comes back ten-fold creating more innovative, creative and loyal employees.

The CEO of GM, Mary Barra, did it best when she reduced the automakers 10-page dress code to just two words “dress appropriately”. Companies today still cling onto novel-like dress codes because they fear a relaxed policy will impact the professionalism of an employee. If you’re investing in the recruiting, training and development of your employees and trusting they can do their job, you should be able to trust them to dress appropriately.

As adults in business, dress codes shouldn’t have to mirror grade school policies. The new era of employees are helping to relax cultures across businesses. Companies have loosened the reins on traditional bound dress codes empowering employees to tap into their decision-making skills pre-work. A suit jacket is still kept in their office or easily accessible should they have a formal meeting.

This small change has proven to have a massive impact on results in business. Giving employees the ability to work in clothing that is comfortable helps to induce creativity and innovation. Communicating and collaborating with employees to create a dress code that everyone understands is key to functioning as a successful workplace.

Exercise a Brain Break to Increase Productivity and Kill the Overwhelm

Some employers remain strict on counting hours and designating a certain amount of breaks during a workday. Creativity isn’t centered around breaks. The brain operates at its own free will. People can’t schedule time in to be overwhelmed but they can manage it by having the flexibility to step outside for a quick breath of fresh air when it occurs.

According to Ferris Jabr of Science American, employees are more productive when they take time for themselves away from the tasks that are overwhelming them than forcing themselves to work through them. More mistakes are bound to happen when the brain is feeling overworked. Taking time to get some fresh air and go for a walk gives a fresh pair of eyes and the ability to recharge energetically, mentally and physically before conquering the task.

Implementing walking clubs and meetings have become a popular wellness initiative across businesses. Google, Samsung and Apple have strong-armed this initiative by encouraging more physical activity. According to a study done by Stanford University, when a person walks, their creative output is increased by 60%. Employers can promote brain breaks by giving their employees the flexibility to tap into their creative mindset with outside influences and new workspaces.   ᐧ",
"One of the foremost steps to finding success is clearly defining your goals. Without knowing specifically what you want to accomplish, you are likely to waste time on pursuing actions that won't help you achieve what you really want to do. Clearly defining what you want to pursue, however, helps you establish what kinds of skills or accomplishments you need to gain in order to accomplish your goal — something vital for leaders.

Doing this, however, can be difficult, especially for young professionals just starting out. To help get you started, six members of Forbes Coaches Council, below, discuss actionable steps that people can take to define goals, and then establish a framework for reaching them. Here's what they advise:

Always start with the reason for the goals, or the ""why."" Many organizational leaders start with tactical things to get to an elusive place without first defining why they want to get there at all. Taking this first step will create the mindset for the new shift and provide the proper energy to move in the direction of the goal. - Heather R. Younger, J.D., Customer Fanatix

Help them develop a clear picture of what they are trying to accomplish or build. Many focus on problems or get enamored with a specific solution. Clarity on outcomes opens up a range of possible solutions. Then we identify ""why"" success matters to them. That's important because it's easy to plan, but it's passion and purpose that sustain progress. - Christian Muntean, Vantage Consulting

3. Consider What Makes Life Matter Most

Someone once called their time on earth as the ""hyphen."" When I asked for clarification, they said, ""you know, our headstone will have a beginning and an end date. It's the hyphen that defines us.” Wherever a client may find themselves right now, their next decision, their next action, their influence on others can be with the right frame of leadership to make their hyphen matter most. - Jon Rambeau, Experiential Leader

Goals that motivate you in a sustained way and rally supporters to your cause are those born from the desire to make a positive impact. If your goals sound something like ""to be the most admired"" or other self-glorifying language, that is a clue they may be born from fear. You are better served to get to the root of your worthiness issues before investing significantly in achieving any goal. - Stephanie Hartman, Catalyst Consulting

Everything starts with passion. In my coaching experience, passion comes from something that was either taken from you or you felt like you could not have at an earlier point. This frustration can be re-framed as a source for passion that can infuse and energize every area of your life. - Rosh Lowe, MicDrop

Start from the top. Identify your ultimate goal and walk backwards, listing out each individual step or action that prepares you for the one above it. When you don't know what a step might be, it's an opportunity to find out. In the end, you'll have a customized map and task list that will guide you directly from where you are to your ideal achievement. - Justin Giddings, The Kickstarter Guy",None
"Over my career in large businesses as well as small ones, it seems that more and more people are feeling unhappy and unfulfilled in their job.

I'm convinced that technology is making this problem worse, rather than better, since it often causes to a sense of isolation working remotely, or even in the same office. Isolation leads to a lack of relationship or connection with others.

For example, while social media exchanges are now quick and simple, they miss all the body language and emotion that many believe constitute more than fifty percent of human relations and communication.

The result is that even highly engaged workers can get results without a sense of fulfillment or satisfaction. This leads to a spiral downhill in productivity and happiness.

Your challenge as an entrepreneur and business leader is to discover ways to improve the fulfillment of your team, without turning back the clock on technology.

I found these issues outlined well in a new book, Back to Human, by Dan Schawbel. I like his research and experience on what it takes to improve connection and fulfillment in this age of isolation at work.

Here are some key actions for improved fulfillment that we both believe every leader and executive needs to adopt:

The first step to fulfillment is insuring that you have face-to-face conversations and joint social activities, so that you get to know one another better outside of social media and email.

The more you and other team members understand others' unique situations, life goals, passions, fears, and obstacles, the more you can help everyone feel more fulfilled, and the more they will help your business.

2. Show how your work contributes to shared values.

Make it evident that values from you and your team drive your business goals, rather than goals driving values. Fulfillment is a function of doing the right thing.

You have to engage the hearts and minds of your team members. To foster team fulfillment, breed optimism, promote resilience, and renew faith and confidence, real leaders look opportunities to reward adherence to values as well as results.

3. Define and foster a higher purpose for the business.

In my experience, both you and your team will have the most satisfaction and fulfillment if you can combine a strong sense of purpose with a quantifiable business opportunity.

In every business, the first higher purpose should be a focus on your customer needs, rather than internal challenges. Without customers, there is no business, and no higher purpose can be satisfied. Beyond that, seek active team participation in outside efforts.

4. Create and support a culture of trust in your team.

Provide the opportunity and encouragement for all team members to do the same. This will demonstrate team member authenticity and help build trust. Be the openness role model.

Listen to what your team members are saying, without interrupting. This shows respect and will help you better give them the feedback they need for fulfillment and trust. It also demonstrates that you are willing to engage with their ideas, thoughts, and feelings.

5. Focus on accomplishments rather than time at work.

We are all still humans, so personal relationships and the interpersonal skills of the team are still essential. Don't forget that critical side of your business.",
"Some people are natural-born leaders, but even those with a take-charge, go-getter attitude must learn how to manage other people effectively if they want to be successful as bosses. Leadership is even trickier when you're a new entrepreneur who is trying to grow a company and a team simultaneously.

It's important to understand your team and what they need from you as their manager, and you're not necessarily going to get it right out of the gate. In fact, many new leaders make mistakes while they're learning the ropes. Below, seven entrepreneurs share the biggest mistakes they made as a boss when they first started their companies, and what they would have done differently if they could go back.

Many entrepreneurs view their businesses as their baby -- something they created and are fully responsible for nurturing and growing to the point of success. It's easy to see failures or setbacks as a personal reflection on yourself, but Ginger Jones, founder and CEO of Jones Therapy Services, reminds fellow business owners that negative circumstances aren't always about you.

""My company is a product of my heart and soul, so any time something went wrong I would beat myself up,"" she says. ""Through work with coaches, I learned to quit taking things personally, look objectively at the situation and remove myself from the outcome.""

One of the most common mistakes new business owners make is trying to control every single operational process. ebenefit Marketplace Founder Frank B. Mengert was no exception, and he admits that he had trouble trusting his team when he first started out.

""I micromanaged every aspect of my business and wanted to be involved in everything. Not only did it hinder my ability to focus on growing the business, it frustrated my team and made them afraid to make choices,"" he shares. ""If you show your team you trust them and their ability to make decisions, you win.""

""When you stay away from being a control freak, you will receive the best work from your team members,"" she says. ""When I didn't see progress, I would try to handle the job myself. I was failing because I couldn't do everything alone.""

Trying to Manage Everyone the Same Way

The best bosses figure out what drives each individual and how each employee likes to communicate, says Aaron Schwartz, co-founder and COO of Passport. This is a lesson he learned the hard way when he took the opposite approach as a new leader.

""When I became a boss for the first time, I had my style -- and only my style. 'Work a lot. No excuses. Keep your personal life at home,'"" says Schwartz. ""Unless you were exactly like me, I was awful. A successful leader is someone who gets the most out of their team, not one who molds others in their style.""

Pretending You Have All the Answers

Like many new leaders, Kasey Kaplan, co-founder and president of Urban FT, felt like he had to have all the answers all the time. This is especially true when you transition from a small team to a larger leadership role.

""It can put an incredible amount of pressure on someone,"" he says. ""My biggest mistake has been not showing humility and not delegating correctly. Leverage the skilled people on your team and openly communicate with them.""

Not Giving Your Team Room to Make Mistakes",
"But that's not what the four-hour workday is about at all. The four-hour workday is about hard science and the limits to our cognition. Even for the most accomplished experts, deliberate practice of any kind is best capped at four hours a day. A shorter workday gives knowledge workers more energy (and yes, time) for what really matters. It also provides better work for more people.

Getting the mind primed for creativity can be a tricky affair. But the key to fuel your creative output is 'empty time'. A study of elite scientists demonstrated that they saw relaxing as an integral part of their performance at work. It's in these wonderful voids where you can let your mind wander and give your subconscious a chance to get dirty. That problem that's been nagging at you may soon feel like it's starting to solve itself.

So unless you're micro-dosing (and even then) -- chances are you can't squeeze more than four hours of deep work into a day. This is the kind of work that stretches your brain, and after an hour or so, a mental fuzz tells you it's time to stop. The rest of the workday demands a fraction of the focus and is really just filler, commonly known as email. Forcing yourself to sit in front of a screen for hours on end is not just bad for your brain, it's not a sustainable strategy for the future.

Setting the right conditions to do your best work requires both scheduled bursts and planned breaks. It might seem counter to the ""time is money"" injunction, but it's ""time off"" that affords you the breakthroughs to leap ahead.

We've become so enamoured with productivity, that we have forgotten how to slow down. We've made busyness a bragging right and '""I haven't got the time"" our collective mantra. Those poor souls with excess time on their hands -- well they must simply not have enough to do! But the goal of a more deliberate workday, peppered with bouts of deep focus rather than perpetual flailing, is all about managing your energy.

Instead of looking at how we spend our time, we should be aware of how we're funnelling our working spirit. Startup entrepreneurs, coding marathoners, workaholics, struggle pornographers, and many may gawk at this. Their ""always-on"" badges are worn with pride. But ask yourself: Would you want your nurse taking care of you at the end of a 12-hour shift or at the beginning of a four-hour one? (Your answer is why a pioneering Dutch healthcare company actually offers 4-hour shifts.)

The hoopla around the four-day work week is not about squeezing more work into the day, so you can bunk off Friday. It's about giving control to workers to do the work they need to do in their own time and in their own way. It's trading in the bulky industrial overcoat for a luminous information cape. If we get our act together quickly, these changes could mean a new age of good work and a better way of life.

Artificial intelligence may be our saving grace to realize a shorter work week. AI's predictive capabilities will help us make faster and better decisions. The richer the data set we feed our personal productivity pals, the better they'll counsel us on the optimal way to expend our energy. With the automation of low-level and mind-numbing tasks, ideally, we are freed up to focus on our deep work sessions. Of course, we may find that instead of working smarter, that we squander our new found time. What's certain is that AI will expose a plethora of pointless work that we perform every day. Having pointless tasks automated won't suddenly make them worthwhile. It will force us to consider not just how much we work but to rethink how we find meaning in it.

The benefits are no longer in dispute: fewer sick days, cost savings, and better work/life integration. And with an enhanced sense of well-being and self-respect, workers tend to be more creative, productive, committed, and collaborative. A shorter work week could let companies save on salaries and reinvest those resources in the training and development of their people. It could also mean more jobs for the unemployed.

New Zealand, Sweden, and Britain are all fans of the shorter workweek. ""I believe that in this century, we can win a four-day working week, with decent pay for everyone,"" Frances O'Grady, the head of the Trades Union Congress in England, recently remarked. The country agrees -- 61% of UK workers think a four-day working week would make them more productive. And in the United States, software company Basecamp has been experimenting with a shorter workweek for over a decade. So too has the State of Utah.

The practice of working long hours unnecessarily will stop sooner than later. Someday we might even value all the work we do that isn't waged. This revised view of work would look to quality, not quantity -- and could finally put to rest that nasty habit of lunching at one's desk.",
"A few years ago, it wasn't uncommon for managers to bring people in for multiple interviews over multiple daplaceholderys. It was also common for managers to drag out the hiring process. It made candidates' lives stressful--never quite knowing if this interview was the final one or not. And even after going through all of this, you might well get ghosted--that is, neither the recruiter nor hiring manager would ever get back to you to tell you that you weren't hired.

And so, it amused me greatly when companies started complaining that candidates were ghosting them. It's a candidate's job market right now, and if you snooze you lose. And to beat that, The Wall Street Journal reports that some companies are hiring sight unseen--after you fill out an application and have a phone interview, they make the decision on the spot. You can start a job without having ever met with a human face-to-face--or even Skype-to-Skype.

While most of the jobs profiled by the WSJ are retail or other entry-level jobs, some are skilled and professional jobs. And this all makes sense to me--I've worked for Inc.com as a freelancer for almost six years and I've never once met a single person who works there. I've talked on the phone and Skyped but I've never been to their offices and no one seems willing to fly to Switzerland to meet me.

The Wall Street Journal quotes Peter Capelli, a professor of management at the University of Pennsylvania, as saying that most companies are ""so bad at interviewing, and the interviews are so full of bias, that it's not crazy to just ignore them altogether.""

He's right. From managers that ask crazy questions to our unconscious bias peeking through and influencing our decisions, our interview skills are not great. You can be a great manager and a great person and still be terrible at interviewing because it's a skill that you don't use often.

You don't have a lot to lose.

We sometimes take hiring decisions more seriously than we should. Almost all employment in the United States is at will. You can fire someone who doesn't work out. This is not to say that you should just fire people right and left, but it means you aren't stuck with a bad choice forever.

Candidates, on the other hand, have a lot more to lose than you do. Most likely, they are leaving their current job for you or are turning down other offers. A job that only lasts a few months looks far worse on their résumé​ than it does on your Glassdoor review. They are the person taking the greater risk.

This job requires that I sit at a computer, analyze information, and write about it in a coherent and entertaining fashion (hopefully with as few typos as possible). An accountant's job is to make sure that all laws are followed and all numbers balance out. A computer coder's job is to write clear, clean code. None of these jobs require great interview skills on a daily basis. Someone who is great at interviewing may not be all that great at doing the actual job, and vice versa.

We place tons of emphasis on the interview when there are other ways to test actual skills. Looking at portfolios, short assignments, and actual tests can all help indicate if this person has what it takes to do the work--in many cases, far better than asking the candidate to share her strengths and weaknesses with you.

I'm not going to advocate for going straight from phone screen to job offer for most jobs, but shortening your hiring process is highly recommended. Don't drag things out. Keep the interview rounds limited and make your decision and move forward. If not, you may miss out on the best and the brightest who have just been hired by your competitors.",
"One thousand students. That’s how many young people were dropping out of Georgia State University due to unpaid fees every semester, many leaving college as a result of a shortfall of under $2,000. Tragically, many of these students were seniors, just months away from earning their college degrees. But thanks to some thorough data analysis, Georgia State noticed this troubling pattern six years ago and began its “Panther Retention Grant” program, where qualified students receive “microgrants” (average size: $900) to cover these tuition gaps.

The results prove that these small investments can have a big payoff. Last year, roughly 2,000 Georgia State students received a Panther Retention Grant and 86% of seniors who got these awards either graduated or were able to stay enrolled and continue accruing credits towards a degree.

As I have written in an earlier column, we know that a college diploma can transform the future earning potential and opportunities for students from low-income families. Students who fail to obtain a college degree after taking out student loans face a daunting economic future. Microgrant programs like the one at Georgia State help young people avoid dropping out due to financial hardship.

This idea is spreading to other colleges and universities. About two years ago, UNC Charlotte started offering “Gold Rush Grants” of $1,500 each to students in need. These small infusions of support make a real difference—students who received the grant graduated at an 8% higher rate than eligible students who didn’t.

Two schools in the California State University system have also begun microgrant programs. California Polytechnic State University’s “Cal Poly Cares” grants and California State University, Fresno’s “Good Samaritan Grants” help students in situations of emergency financial need.

At KIPP, the public charter school network I lead, many of our more than 12,000 alumni currently enrolled in college share the same struggles as the students from these colleges. While many of our KIPP alumni qualify for Federal Pell Grants and financial aid to pay for tuition and books, they often face daunting costs for rent, food, transportation and other costs that aren’t always covered by student loans and grants. In fact, nearly 60% of our alumni surveyed in 2016 said they worried that they would run out of food, and 43% said they had missed meals in order to pay for books, fees or other school expenses.

To address these and other barriers to persistence, KIPP schools in Washington DC started piloting their own microgrant program beginning in 2014, funded by the Ludwig Family Foundation. Over the past four years, KIPP DC has offered 39 persistence grants to alumni in college, and 95% are persisting towards their degree or have already graduated. These awards, which average around $3,200, provide critical support, like helping KIPP alumni take summer courses to fill credits and accelerate towards graduation or covering living expenses that can derail a college degree.

Sara is one alumna the KIPP DC Persistence Fund supported. Sara worked throughout her time at the University of Maryland, College Park, not only to contribute to her education but to also help with her family’s household bills. When her mother faced unemployment toward the end of Sara’s college career, Sara, her family, and her KIPP Through College advisor worked tirelessly to find financial solutions to make ends meet. After exhausting all other possible resources, a Persistence Fund award of $1,632 helped her cross the finish line and earn the B.A. degree that she worked so hard to obtain.

Now KIPP is expanding these efforts into a larger national program that will help KIPP alumni across the country. The KIPP National Ludwig College Persistence Fund provides pools of funding that KIPP regions can draw on to offer one-time, emergency grants to students currently in college to prevent them from dropping out or taking semesters off. Next year, KIPP will expand the persistence program to four new communities: Memphis, New York City, Philadelphia and the San Francisco Bay Area. Based on what we’re seeing in DC, we are eager to see the impact at a larger scale.

Interventions like these show that small shifts in resources can have an enormous impact on first-generation college students from low-income backgrounds. Many of these young people take out thousands of dollars in loans and work multiple jobs while pursuing their degrees. A persistence grant of a few thousand dollars can be the difference between a student dropping out and graduating. Microgrants aren’t just transformative for the students who receive them—they also ensure the tax dollars already invested in their education lead to graduation day. Over the coming years, we will be tracking and reporting on the results of the microgrants. Our goal in doing so is to shine a bright light on solutions to barriers that first-generation college goers face as they pursue their careers.",
"Brand transparency is crucial today, and consumers expect companies to be honest and authentic in their endeavors. In a world dominated by social media, however, it seems brands are one miscommunication away from losing millions of dollars in revenue.

Something as simple as an online post can cost your brand its positive reputation, especially when it comes from a member of your C-suite. To help companies avoid this, we asked a panel of Forbes Communications Council members for some public relations (PR) strategies businesses can adopt to minimize unexpected brand-related announcements.

Employee advocacy can be a powerful tool, but only when wielded wisely. Before you encourage any employee to begin using social media as a company representative or spokesperson, provide in-depth training and clear guidelines. Central to those guidelines must be the 'don't be stupid' list: don't share company secrets, don't be racist, don't pick fights, don't make unapproved announcements, etc. - Holly Chessman, GlowTouch Technologies

2. Ask Leadership To Check In With PR Before Sharing Information

It's easy for leaders who are social media savvy or have news contacts on speed dial to feel it's ok to put out a quick announcement. To minimize unexpected brand-related announcements that may impact ongoing PR/brand strategies, make sure leadership is willing to check in first with the PR team/agency. They will be able to fine-tune the message and anticipate any impact on the brand strategy. - Nysha King, MRINetwork

Rather than stifling executives on social media (which results in boring corporate communications and can ultimately shrink your audience and hurt your brand), companies should require that major brand-related posts be vetted by PR and legal to prevent damaging gaffes. - Steve Tan, eCommerce Elites Mastermind

4. Hire Good Leaders Who Are Less Likely To Cause PR Nightmares

When an individual is synonymous with or becomes bigger than the company itself, PR nightmares are all but inevitable -- especially in the age of 24/7 digital media. Brands wanting to minimize unexpected announcements can try to guide the leader through coaching, but should also make sure they are granting leadership positions to those who led high-performing (and happy) teams. - Cameron Conaway, Solace

5. Be Able To Detach From The Leader's Persona If Necessary

Planning ahead with 'values marketing' on a quiet, consistent basis is key. Guardrails for communications by C-suite members and others are important. Thing one about guardrails is that you don't need them until you do. Thing two: Guardrails aren't fences, and your C-suite can jump over them. The brand must be 'modularized,' able to detach from its leader's persona quickly, to survive such issues. - Edmond M Allmond, Hyperloop Transportation Technologies, Inc.

Corporate messaging, prepared statements and speaker training is no substitute for common sense. Digital tools enabling us to react, share opinions and self-publish are ubiquitous. Just because we can instantaneously share our thoughts doesn't mean we should. Take a pause and think it through. Use your common sense because there are no do-overs. - Reyne Quackenbush, ThoughtWorks

Executives are busy. They have to run the company and ensure profitability. They should not be tweeting or engaging in social media, as that’s a waste of their time. The marketing/communications team is responsible for managing the executive brand. Take control. Make the executive look good, while he/she stays focused on the business. - Parna Sarkar-Basu, Brand and Buzz Marketing, LLC.

Having a face for your brand sounds like the best thing you can do, right? Wrong. One bad tweet from can have immeasurable consequences. The best way to combat this is to have diversity in your influencers. Containing every misjudged comment would be a PR nightmare, but diversifying your influencers allows you to drown out the inevitable slip-ups. - Jeff Grover, Best Company

First thing's first, it is important to develop a thorough and seamless crisis plan and secure alignment from internal teams before a crisis occurs. Slip-ups may happen, but a quick, transparent and genuine response can help minimize or even defuse a situation with your brand versus trying to hide or ignore missteps. - G'Nai Blakemore, Mattress Firm

If it is true, the worst thing to do is to deny it or say nothing in hopes that it passes over. You never want to appear disingenuous to your consumers and shareholders because you can't afford to lose their faith. Once you have lost the trust of your most valuable stakeholders, you may never gain it back. Own it if an announcement was released prematurely and go all in on it as much as possible. - Edward Bourelly, OMNI-CULTURE MARKETING, INC.

CEOs who use colorful language can be a liability and an asset to a brand. Minimize liability by embracing tools like TweetDeck that allow PR teams to review a tweet in the queue. Tweets aren't censored but a second opinion can weigh in if a post crosses legal boundaries or could pose a potential gaffe. While this process isn't ideal for every tweet (or CEO), it's one step to eliminate error. - Monica McCafferty, MCM Strategies LLC

12. Help Your Leaders Understand That Tweets And Actions Matter

In PR, actions speak louder than words. This holds especially true for executives who serve as the face and brand of publicly traded companies. At the same time, PR pros have a responsibility to ensure that even the smartest founders understand the importance of adhering to established values and public policy positions. Issue management training now must extend to personal social media usage. - Marija Zivanovic-Smith, NCR Corporation",
"When I started JUSTJUNK at 25 I was broke and banks weren’t willing to lend me any money.  I learned very quickly that if I was going to grow a national franchise system, it would require some creativity and a keen sense for keeping people invested in helping the business grow.  I’ve tried almost every compensation structure imaginable over the years and have learned retaining great people is more about the strength of the employees' relationship with their boss than it is about compensation.

The single most important factor that keeps staff retention high is how loyal you are to your team. On occasion, I’ve been challenged for giving franchise owners or my head office employees too many chances, however, without loyalty, there is little trust to be gained. Everyone needs to know that they’re valued and their contributions to the company are important.  I too-often hear other franchise organizations say “slow to hire - quick to fire”, which is troubling. Too many people quickly get unfairly labelled when they join a new organization before they have a chance to prove themselves.

Money can keep people on, but it is a lower factor on the list than you may think.  We’d all like to make a little more money but would you jump jobs to make just an extra 10 - 20%, running the risk of working for someone who doesn’t trust you or micromanages and bullies you with fear tactics?.  We spend so much of our lives communicating with work colleagues that a negative relationship with a toxic manager or executive simply isn’t worth it for the extra pay.

You’ve heard the Golden Rule, “treat people the way you want to be treated.”  Obvious stuff right? Unfortunately, it’s not obvious to everyone. As I’ve watched my company mature, I’ve seen franchise owners implement different management styles and internally, managers at HQ try new things with our corporate staff.  People who were quick to fire never seemed to keep any employees for long. You can set the bar for the job high, but, if your staff views the workplace as a revolving door with a Trump-like boss yelling “You're Fired” from the boardroom, they will never feel a strong sense of security and one foot will always be out the door.

Employees also need to believe in the vision and trust that the franchise owner or founder is not only going to be loyal to them but also to the company.  Why would employees pour their heart and soul into something if the franchise owner is on their way out the door or mentally checked out looking for the next opportunity?  The passion and commitment demonstrated by the franchise owner will have a lasting impact on staff retention. If they sense the franchise owner already has one foot out the door, they likely won’t stick around for the ride.

Being an ultra-flexible leader is also key to keeping great people.   Work and lives have become so intertwined that giving staff flexibility without micromanaging every move goes a very long way in the eyes of the employee.  It is not uncommon for me to receive emails from staff at all hours of the night. I know they don’t need to work into the wee hours of the morning, and equally, I know they don’t need me micromanaging every second they are not at their desk. When everyone is engaged and passionate about their work, timekeeping isn’t needed - the results will speak for themselves.

Finally, but no less important, is understanding everyone’s own path of opportunity. Some people want to climb the corporate ladder while others are happy staying right where they are. For those that are eager to explore new opportunities within a franchise or corporate organization, it is the leaders' role to always look for new meaningful responsibilities or risk losing employees.  I've lost some great employees because we weren’t growing fast enough and I didn’t have enough capital to place individuals into the newly created roles. Seek out new revenue-generating roles or responsibilities so the new opportunity you have provided to your employee can help pay for itself.

People are the heartbeat of every franchise or company. Take the time to better understand what makes your staff happy.  Always seek candid feedback on what is important to your staff so you can foster a work environment that nobody ever wants to leave. At the end of the day, it will be less about the bells and whistles and boil down to how confident and trusting they will be in placing their career in your hands.",
"It sounds simple enough: Hire and promote the best among us. Do what you must to entice high performers who are competent in areas of leadership, strategy, strategic thinking, etc. Find the superstars – the industry rock stars – and get them to lead your teams. And when you can’t find or recruit them, do your best to develop them, hope for them and even steal them when necessary to ensure your organization holds a strategic and competitive advantage to achieve success.

Oh, but my clients – and my own management experiences – tell me it’s not so simple. Many qualified candidates and experienced managers don’t actually know what strategic thinking is or what it looks like. Words like strategy, strategic thinking, strategic thinker and strategic leadership have all become part of the latest array of buzzwords that managers use in executive and team meetings and candidates put on their résumés without truly understanding the nuts and bolts of it all.

Strategic thinking is a highly sought skill. Whether you are the executive trying to put together a strategic leadership team or the applicant on the prowl for your next position or promotion, this is useful information for you. There are several things you can do to show that you are a strategic thinker. You can practice these six habits of true strategic thinkers as well as demonstrate the following three unmistakable signs of strategic thinking.

1. Strategic Thinkers Make Better Decisions By Being More Reflective

Strategic thinkers do it differently. They understand and dig deeper with regards to analyzing processes, developing and applying performance metrics, collecting data and producing analytics to make more informed decisions. Strategic thinkers have high levels of critical thinking skills. When it comes to decision making, they are more contemplative and ask more thoughtful questions like the ones listed below. They challenge themselves, colleagues, employees, supervisors and executives to consider answers for these questions.

Strategic thinkers are more observant and reflective than the average person. Here are some questions they might process through and consider in order to make better decisions for any particular issue, problem, event or strategy.

2. Strategic Thinkers Advance Their Careers By Being Better Leaders

Strategic thinkers are – more often than not – all over leadership. Not all great thinkers are great leaders, but the ones who are leadership material are likely better leaders than those who fail to think strategically. The sum of the whole is much greater than the individual parts.

Strategic leadership is what happens when leaders move beyond the role of having and communicating a vision to fully understanding, thinking about, planning and executing the necessary strategies to realize it. I further define it as what happens when we are exploring, deciphering and interpreting the best concepts for achieving organizational excellence, anticipating and responding to change and aligning organizational systems, processes and people with enhanced services and/or products.

But it’s not just about your organization. If you want to advance your brand and your career, be more strategic. When an individual is being ‘strategic’ about it, she is focused on and considers both the hard and soft side of the system and weighs the implications and consequences of decisions to determine whether or not they impact and affect the team’s ability to accomplish strategic outcomes.

If you are doing this – connecting the dots and taking into account the entire system – you are being a strategic thinker who also demonstrates exceptional leadership. These two competencies together are what we know to be strategic leadership.

To learn more specific things that strategic thinkers do to get promoted, read the companion article to this one ""3 Things Strategic Thinkers Do To Get Hired In Senior Management Positions.""

3. Strategic Thinkers Demonstrate Organizational Value By Creating More Strategic Thinkers

To demonstrate their value to the team and the organization, strategic thinkers ask questions that reveal their propensity for and commitment to strategy. It is important to find and balance the value in strategic thinking. You can’t ignore strategy and be a strategic thinker. You can’t disregard the importance of delivering value as a leader and be a strategic thinker. And you can’t be too busy to make it a priority to develop a culture where others are encouraged to do the same. Strategic thinkers are the ones in the organization who ponder and prompt questions that are designed to create even more strategic thinkers.

Again, the benefits of strategic thinking are twofold. The advantage is not just for achieving organizational goals. Strategic leaders – individuals who demonstrate their competence and talent to both lead and think strategically – have a unique advantage when it comes to owning their careers as well as leading their organizations. If you apply these strategic thinking principles to areas of career advancement, salary negotiations, relationship development, networking, performance agreements and brand development, you will surely experience immense professional benefit.",
"“A more efficient and effective organizational nervous system” – combination of instincts and skills to survive and deliberately developed new strengths to thrive. Those new strengths include developing leaders, customer focus and business excellence. That comes from my conversation with Sarah Pettengill and CEO Jan Jamrich about their work at Entromy.

Instincts and skills to survive - The new normal

They report “Results-driven” as the top cultural attribute for companies growing   than the competition. In fact, the top three cultural characteristics for slower growing companies were “results-driven,” “individual ambition,” and “passionate.”

These are companies are getting the basics right: Improving technology. Clarifying roles and capabilities. Aligning organization on top priorities.

Deliberately developed new strengths to thrive: Beating the new normal.

Entromy’s study revealed that highly successful organizations are focused on developing leaders, customer focus and business excellence.

Even within this highly fluctuating, highly dynamic new tech space, developing leaders are senior executives’ #1 priority and their #1 challenge. New leaders are also seeking clarity from strong organizational structures, clear decision-making, and authority to execute and deliver results.

Those are required to stay with the pack.",
"When trying to cope with a widespread social phenomenon, such as child maltreatment, you quickly come to an understanding that in order to succeed, focusing on one aspect related to your targeted phenomenon is usually not enough. It takes a vibrant, diverse team of skilled professionals from different disciplines to tackle it, step by step.

My nonprofit has been working to train professionals and engage in research in order to cope with child abuse and neglect. Putting aside the emotional load that is inevitable while dealing closely with this issue, we had to figure out a way to work with the various services and professions addressing this issue.

Our mission was in front of our eyes, but like many nonprofits, we had to choose our strategy and focus. Where should we start? This phenomenon has legal, medical, educational and social aspects to it. Should we focus on one aspect or reach out to all professions at once? How can we provide the information and tools needed to all the different disciplines?

The quest to answering these questions led us to a clear answer. We needed to work as a multidisciplinary team in order to be truly relevant and to create a multi-professional language that would allow all services working with abused and neglected children to work in cohesion. If our goal is to cope with this widespread social phenomenon, we need the best players from all the various fields on our team. But how do you lead such a team?

Here are some of my tips for leading a multidisciplinary staff and working with a variety of professionals:

When leading a multidisciplinary team that trains and works with a variety of professionals, you have to set a clear vision for your non-governmental organization's (NGO) goals and targets. Each staff member might have a different professional socialization, but the essence and vision of your NGO should be shared by all. Deciding upon clear goals that are known and shared with the entire staff is the first step in leading your way to success.

Working with various professional groups and hand-tailoring programs for your diverse customers might pull you away from your main goals as an NGO. In my NGO, for example, each service we reach out to might request training on different topics related to their unique working environment. It should be clear to all workers on our staff what our main goals are, and they should keep them as the primary focus of their daily interaction with our clients.

Staying true to your initial goals and making decisions according to them is the only way to keep your NGO focused and target-aimed, especially when trying to cope with such complicated social realities.

It doesn't matter whether you're a cop, a social worker or a nurse -- while working together to overcome a widespread social phenomenon, everyone should put their ego aside.

As a team, we all work together to achieve mutual goals that are bigger and much more important than our individual professional ego. By working together, a multidisciplinary staff can become a model for cooperative work in the eyes of the multidisciplinary services that should be collaborating in the field.

Even more than with any other staff, you should place an important emphasis on communication when it comes to working with staff members from various professions. Staff meetings, ongoing updates, mutual programs and learning sessions are valuable and much needed in order to keep everyone in synchronization, up to date and focused on the same goals.

It is important for all staff members to speak in a unified professional language, alongside the language they were socialized to speak with their own peers. By creating a common terminology within your team, despite its differences, you will enable mutual learning within your NGO -- an enhancement of knowledge and cooperation which will enrich the work being done and will advance your NGO toward achieving its goals.

Becoming an inherent part of your NGO, this unified professional language will trickle down to the professional field, creating a solid base for gaining knowledge and working together to overcome complicated social phenomenon.

In conclusion, my experience has helped me understand that coping with widespread social issues requires, in many ways, coping with a wide range of professionals on your team and out in the field. To remain relevant and create an impact, you and your team must remain focused on your main goals, work together and communicate effectively. Succeeding in that might enable other significant players in your field to collaborate with one another and can create a strong foundation for tackling complicated phenomenon, together.",communication
"My days are all about candidates. Not just because my work is focused on recruiting (it is), but because the two decades I've spent in the business world have taught me that success comes down to two elements: How hard am I going to work? And how good are the people around me?

Your answers to these questions will likely do more to define your success than anything else. Why? Because you can control the outcome, and that's a vanishingly rare business advantage.

As the leader of agency owner recruiting and development at Farmers Insurance, it's my job to think about recruiting from a variety of angles and perspectives to help ensure that we're always refining how we find candidates that are not only good, but good for us. And I've come to realize that while needs vary wildly, good recruiting practices are universal.

Treat every hire like your first.

The first recruit for a fledgling business can be critical. It's the first time the vision for what the business will be passes from the owner to another person. And the cost of that growth is investing confidence in someone else to represent the brand, the vision and the mission to the rest of the world. The significance of that choice focuses our search and helps us pinpoint what we need in that first candidate. And because the stakes are high, we have the patience to wait for the right person.

Imagine approaching every hire like that first one. As businesses grow and time becomes more of a luxury for their owners, it can be tempting to hasten the process and let ""good enough"" win out over ""right for us."" That candidate who is just good enough isn't necessarily going to make or break your business, but if they wouldn't have passed muster as the first, they're likely not the best fit now either.

One of the traits I'm always on the lookout for is an entrepreneurial spirit. When I meet people who are driven and ambitious, even if they don't have experience expressly in the field for which I am recruiting, I take interest, because I know how far hard work goes in any industry.

If your goal is to support growth, especially in a small business, keep an eye out for candidates with an entrepreneurial spark -- even if they won't be working in sales, that drive can make them a powerful motivator for change and growth in your organization.

Recruiting is a challenge that's never solved. Whether through growth or turnover, your needs are going to change, and even with the best practices in place, you're occasionally going to have a mismatch between a new person and the organization.

Small business owners should consider recruiting two people, and expect to keep one. This is more practical than cynical. Strategic planning calls for having all of your bases covered, and that means considering the eventuality that a new addition might not work out. That's the root of this advice, but here's the kicker: If both stay, your business will be better prepared to grow into the need for both of them.

People tend to be surprised when I tell them how integral I believe research is to recruiting. And I'm not talking about doing a deep dive on a search engine for each of your prospects. I find research more valuable in terms of tracking down new resources that can lead us to great candidates, and can tell us more about our historical successes and failures.",
"We are in the season of thanks. We're planning the get-togethers. We're making the lists. We might even be cramming to hit deadlines at work--trying to wrap up important projects before the holiday season totally overwhelms us. And, somewhere in the back of our minds, we're thinking about gratitude--all the stuff we should be thankful for.

Obviously, we should be grateful if we possess health, wealth, and success. But recent conclusions to an ongoing, 80-year Harvard study made me wonder if we're all too focused on what we should be thankful for, instead of whom. ""Close relationships, more than money or fame, are what keep people happy throughout their lives,"" the study revealed.

Heading into the season of thanks, I thought it might be important to keep this message top-of-mind so we don't accidentally overlook what really matters in this world and at our workplaces--the people who add so much to our lives. Here are nine quotes to keep you focused on the true reason for the season.

1. ""Silent gratitude isn't very much to anyone."" --Gertrude Stein

Appreciation is an emotion. Recognition is the communication of that emotion. Leaders around the world often tell me how much they appreciate their people. But when I ask, ""Do they know that?"" the No. 1 answer I hear is, ""I think so."" Don't take that risk. Tell them today how much you appreciate them.

2. ""Develop an attitude of gratitude, and give thanks for everything that happens to you, knowing that every step forward is a step toward achieving something bigger and better than your current situation."" --Brian Tracy

While we often show appreciation to the people we like the most, we often forget to be grateful to those who taught us the most. Be thankful for that bad boss. They taught you a lot about yourself, and who you don't want to become. Treat everything as a valuable learning experience.

3. ""I don't have to chase extraordinary moments to find happiness--it's right in front of me if I'm paying attention and practicing gratitude."" --Brené​ Brown

The old saying, ""Stop and smell the roses,"" isn't just about recognizing beauty. It's about living in the moment and truly seeing the world around you. In fact, ""Stop and smell the dead fish"" might be a more profound statement, because although the smell is nasty, it might mean dinner is near.

4. ""No duty is more urgent than that of returning thanks."" --James Allen

While it's important to remind ourselves to recognize the people who add value to our lives, the intention must always remain sincere. For example, if you were tasked to recognize someone in the next 10 minutes, it might at first feel like an obligation. But within just a few seconds of time, the list of people you truly feel grateful for will grow beyond your imagination.

7. ""At times, our own light goes out and is rekindled by a spark from another person. Each of us has cause to think with deep gratitude of those who have lighted the flame within us."" --Albert Schweitzer

If you ever question your ability to inspire another human being, reflect on your own life. Think about the teacher, the coach, the friend, or the boss in your early career who recognized your special talent or ability. You will never forget that moment. And you have the opportunity to create that moment for someone else.",coaching
"As we near the end of the year, I find it's a great time to reflect and take some time for yourself. In my last article, I talked about ways to prepare your business for the new year. It's also important to prepare yourself personally. If you want to grow your business and be successful, it all starts with you.

The idea of self-care isn't a new one, but I find it's worth repeating for entrepreneurs and small business owners. Our lives are filled with pressure--both professionally and personally--and it can be easy to overlook your personal well-being in favor of putting energy into running your business. However, if you're not in a good place (too much on your mind, too much to do) you won't be putting your best effort into your business and are unlikely to succeed. Here are a few ways to focus on yourself:

Taking the time to focus on your well-being in addition to that of your business will help you be mentally, emotionally and even physically ready to handle the demands. For organized people and overachievers, it may be good to schedule this time in your busy schedules, forcing you to take the time for yourself. Try out some of these methods and you will surely feel better and it will help your business thrive.",
"No one does anything worthwhile alone, and that's why we all want -- scratch that -- why we all need -- to build great teams.

In the U.S. and throughout the West, corporations place great emphasis on the word ""teamwork."" But for companies with global teams, its meaning does not necessarily translate. Rather than bring employees together and help take efforts to the next level, it can be a source of confusion and even friction.

This is especially true in Asian countries including Vietnam. Throughout much of Asia, teamwork tends to be an alien concept. Much of this has to do with cultural norms around face and respect.

In most Asian cultures, people typically do not express their disagreement publicly. It is also extremely important not to lose face, and there is a strong attachment to hierarchy. In the corporate world, this manifests itself as a desire to respect those at a more senior level and receive respect from those at a lower one. This mindset is prevalent in Vietnam, although it is not as strongly rooted in the culture as it is in Japan, Korea, and to a lesser extent, China.

The idea of not losing face, even though it's not necessarily referred to in that way, definitely applies in the U.S., though.

True, but Vietnamese people find teamwork particularly difficult, because we are such a self-reliant people.  has made it so. Put too much trust and reliance in other people, and you will end up being subjugated by them.

That's why trying to instill a teamwork culture is something many multinationals struggle with when they attempt to import Western business practices to the region. It is one of the biggest mistakes they make when they come to Asia, and they will almost certainly fail.

But a simple mindset shift can help prevent this. The shift begins with focusing not on the teamwork dynamic, but on the notion of ""owning your work,"" which resonates more intuitively throughout much of Asia and certainly in Vietnam.

In essence, owning your work is about taking responsibility. It's about understanding that success or failure results from personal efforts, not external factors. We must each accept responsibility not only for our own successes, but also, for our mistakes.

Instilling this core value -- and the corollary understanding that it is not productive to assign blame or accept undue credit -- will help teams work more collaboratively and harmoniously even in the absence of an explicit teamwork culture.

This tends to resonate best with competitive type-A personalities who may be fairly self-focused as they strive to climb the corporate ladder. Once they get into management positions, they are often ineffective until they realize they are being judged on their ability to support others. They start making an effort once they understand that making others look good makes them look good, too.

Another aspect of the mindset shift is for leaders to ask themselves, ""How can I inspire employees to feel the same level of dedication as the company's founders and leaders? What structures can be put in place to achieve this and help the staff interact well with each other?""

For instance, each year my company holds a songwriting competition. All of the entrants are invited to our headquarters to take part in a gala performance each October that celebrates THP's anniversary. Some of the entries are by individual people, but most of them are by departments who have worked collaboratively on a song and a routine.  Typically, they'll dress identically as well.

Although they behave as a collective, they still would not describe their actions as teamwork. What they have is a shared sense of ownership. Everyone feels they have a stake in the outcome and they take great pride in being able to showcase their work to their colleagues and the rest of the organization.",
"Ever felt like you're just average? Don't believe it, because it's a lie; you can be awesome by choice the moment you step out of bed every morning.

It's what people with a growth mindset experience daily. This is arriving at a point in your personal development where failure is embraced and even welcomed as you learn and pick up new habits to improve your situation at work or in your relationships.

If you want to learn a few new tricks that will elevate your average status to that of ""awesome,"" try learning and adapting the behaviors of the most successful people on the planet.

If you haven't been rejected a number of times, the current mantra goes, you just haven't experienced success. Yet failure is the secret to success. In fact, Sir Richard Branson, founder of Virgin Group, swears by this premise. At Virgin, they encourage and even celebrate failure. The billionaire Branson says, ""Do not be embarrassed by your failures. Learn from them and start again. Making mistakes and experiencing setbacks is part of the DNA of every successful entrepreneur, and I am no exception.""

2. Surround yourself with awesome people to become awesome.

At a 2004 Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting, billionaire Warren Buffett told a 14-year-old from California one of the secrets to his success: ""It's better to hang out with people better than you. Pick out associates whose behavior is better than yours and you'll drift in that direction."" Buffett taught a common-sense life lesson for all of us about absorbing the very qualities and traits of awesome and successful people who have demonstrated skills and traits that will make us better leaders, workers, parents, and human beings.

3. Focus on saying no more to become awesome.

In the frantic pace of life to do more and be more, we hardly think about the importance of focus. That's why this quote by Steve Jobs 22 years ago hits the nail on the head even more so today. He said:

People think focus means saying yes to the thing you've got to focus on. But that's not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I'm actually as proud of the things we haven't done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things.

Without focus, your very ability to think, reason, communicate, problem solve, and make decisions will naturally suffer. You just can't maximize your efficiency or go into a state of flow if your mind is wandering off into multitask land. That ... is not awesome.

4. Read more to become awesome.

Bill Gates reads about 50 books every year, Mark Cuban reads three hours every day, Mark Zuckerberg resolved to read 24 books in a year, and Warren Buffett spends 80 percent of his day reading. Plain and simple, awesome people learn by reading what the most successful people on the planet are currently reading. To get you started, BookAuthority provides endless recommendations from hundreds of business icons such as Gates, Branson, Buffett, Musk, Bezos, Zuckerberg, and Cook.

5. Be genuinely interested in other people to become awesome.

Next time you go to a networking event or cocktail party, lose the elevator pitch. Instead, your first order of priority is to take the attention off yourself and put it squarely on the person across from you. Research has determined that being interested in others is more important than being interesting yourself. So, whatever you do, talk in terms of the other person's interest. You'll be surprised by the outcome.",
"Mention Google to most people and they think of search engines, Gmail or Google Maps. But Google is part of a much larger company called Alphabet with many different lines of business. One that you might not be as familiar with is Jigsaw, a group using technology to reduce attacks on conversations, information and people.

Over the last two decades, technology has irrevocably changed society. The ability to access and share infinite amounts of information, immediately and for free, has had an enormous impact on society as a whole. Sometimes for good, other times for ill.

Countering these negative effects was the inspiration behind Jigsaw. While it can be costly and risky to attack someone or something in the real world, the anonymity and reach of the Internet makes it an ideal platform for causing harm to others digitally. Jigsaw is committed to countering bullying, state sponsored attacks, or even vitriol from hate groups using tech and a powerful network of partner organizations.

The woman tasked with identifying and engaging those partners is Patricia Georgiou, Head of Partnerships and Business Development for Jigsaw. Her work recruiting partners to help with research, development, product design and dissemination is instrumental to the group’s success.

This is because just as technology is not the sole driver of these problems, it cannot be the sole solution. It requires more than just code and demands that people, organizations and viewpoints be pieced together to form an answer. Hence the organization’s name: Jigsaw.

Georgiou brings together the collaborators that can help turn ideas into impact and amplify the reach of Jigsaw’s products around the world. Her fingerprints are evident throughout some of the core focal areas for Jigsaw, including:

Counter Terrorism: Jigsaw developed and published the Redirect Method a counter-radicalization technique using ad targeting to promote counter-speech. It can be used to debunk propaganda and radicalization programs run online by violent extremist groups like ISIS. To help hone and pressure test the program, Georgiou enlisted the help of a number of Countering Violent Extremists (CVE) experts.

Information and Elections: Google’s mission is to make information universally accessible and useful, but some information is particularly vulnerable. Recent headlines have taught us this is especially true during elections when news websites, political campaigns and election-monitoring organizations are all susceptible to hackers or cyber attacks. To help shore up these key areas of democracy, Georgiou helped assemble a network of journalism associations, human rights and civil society organizations that worked in partnership with Jigsaw to develop a series of products like Outline, Shield, Intra, and Protect Your Election.

Online harassment: The threat of online harassment, bullying or doxxing can limit people’s interest or ability to access important information. This reduces the opportunity for people to engage in meaningful conversations and share different perspectives on important social issues. To help, Jigsaw is leveraging AI and machine learning to analyze comments at scale and detect toxic behavior as part of a solution called Perspective. Georgiou’s ability to bring the New York Times, Wikipedia and other online publishers into the development has been critical to its success so far.

Georgiou has always been motivated by a desire to improve the world around her. Originally from Lebanon, she trained as a lawyer before moving to Paris for work on an impact oriented strategic investment fund. Administered by the French government, it had a goal to create jobs in strategic sectors like technology, the environment and healthcare.

It was in this role that she began to understand the ability of tech to broaden the impact she hoped to achieve. She realized that technology was not only shaping the business world, but also how the world interacts and communicates. It was that awareness that led her to Jigsaw, where her professional and personal goals were well aligned with the company’s mission.

Despite working for an Alphabet company, Georgiou did not expect to have a career in technology. In her words: “When I was training as a lawyer, Google was not yet a verb.” But even without this early indoctrination, she has become a believer and works closely with software engineers, product teams and others on a daily basis.

But she is adamant that a technology background is not necessary to work in this space. She feels that her work with these experts has taught her more than any formal training could have provided. And her business training – along with multi-cultural (and multilingual) exposure – has helped her build bridges across the different sectors and geographies where she works.

It is because of this that she thinks more women should enter technology related fields. Technology continues to change the world and shape every aspect of our lives, and we can all play a meaningful role in it even without formal training. With more women in the field, Georgiou knows that technology can better reflect the diversity of viewpoints of the people it is meant to serve.",
"Meg Whitman, the former Chief Executive Officer of Hewlett Packard and now head of the digital media startup, NewTV, did the opposite of what everyone else was doing to recruit the best people. As companies prioritized hard skills and prestigious college degrees, Whitman looked deeper into the people she interviewed. She hired candidates hungry to succeed even if they didn't meet all the bullet points of a job description.

Many human resources professionals approach recruiting with the same age-old industry practices that no longer apply to the new era of workers. Instead of focusing on potential, they ignore resumes that don’t fit all of the criteria and spend the interview drilling down on the technical skills. This leads to hiring candidates based off of impressive resumes with little to no understanding of the type of worker they are and what motivates them.

While many view Whitman as one of the most sought-after and accomplished executives in business, most forget she has entrepreneurial roots that run deep. Before joining as their CEO, she scaled eBay from a mere 30 to over 15,000 employees increasing their revenue by over 2000% in just 10 years. Her ability to be successful in this weighed on the fact that she focused on hiring people with the drive, character and hunger to take to the next level.

Whitman has worked with some of the most powerful brands in the world such as Disney, , and eBay. As a natural leader passionate about growing companies and making them successful, she understands the importance of building a solid internal culture first.

When hiring Sheryl Sandberg in 2000, now COO of , Whitman saw the hunger Sandberg had to learn the skills to excel in her position even though she lacked the relevant experience. In an interview with Reid Hoffman on his podcast “Master of Scale”, Sandberg shared how this experience taught her to remove the constraints on the candidate pool by focusing on a person's ambition.

This proved to be invaluable in shaping the way Google formed its teams and culture, making it one of the most desirable places to work in the world today. Sandberg achieved great success with this technique and eventually brought it with her to improve the recruiting strategy at Facebook. The social media platform doesn't believe in siloed departments but instead a place where everyone contributes to making Facebook greater even if the tasks are outside the scope of the role.

An emphasis on a strong people culture requires a mutual relationship of flexibility from employees and employers. It's not uncommon for employees to wear many hats performing tasks outside of their role. The mentality of it's not in my job description is an outdated mindset for inflexible people. These are the type of people Whitman avoided when recruiting because siloed workers do little to drive growth.

The once heavy focus on a college degree and impressive background are taking a backseat to the hunger and creativity candidates embody to make companies more innovative. Companies such as  , EY, and are focusing more on hands-on learning experience than degrees. Vocational programs, online learning courses and boot camps allow candidates to gain experience for a fraction of the standard college tuition. This opens up the candidate pool to people who wouldn’t have been given a chance otherwise.

The goal isn’t to neglect the college degree altogether but to reframe recruiting practices to prevent time wasted hiring the wrong people. A candidate with the hunger to learn is more valuable than a candidate who has become complacent with their hard skills.  Hungry employees drive greater profits while complacent employees settle on a steady paycheck.

This isn’t a new concept, just a concept that’s been neglected and overshadowed by the gleam of an impressive skill set and a traditional college degree. While it may be tempting to hire the person with the most impressive skills, it doesn’t mean they’re aligned with company values. The most important thing to remember is the person hired is the person who can improve or destroy the morale of a company. If there is a mismatch in personality and values, the working relationship is going to suffer.

Companies can prevent the frustration of hiring the wrong person by investing in someone who has the potential to be great and the desire to learn than someone who has become stagnant with their acquired knowledge and experience. Human Resources should use the interview as a time to get to know a person's patterns of behavior, how they think and what makes them tick.

With Whitman and Sandberg’s experience as proof, people who are hungry for growth and eager to develop their skill set are the ones to drive the business towards greater profits.",
"What if you don't want a cloud based CRM application? What if you just want to buy and install the software in your office? Believe it or not, I regularly run into businesses that ask me these questions.  It's not that they’re averse to the cloud. But they have reasons why they would prefer to keep things in house.

For example, we have one client with offices around the world and a strong internal information technology team that has built a fast network and who claims that their applications running on their intranet are actually faster than the ones hosted by outsiders. I have another client who has created a very customized order processing system and wants something in-house to integrate with it. There are some smaller companies that have perfectly good servers and networks and prefer using those.

Then there are others who argue that their data is more secure in-house than hosted externally. Some of those clients - large healthcare or financial services firms - may have a point. Besides, they're subject to such regulatory oversight that exposing their data to the outside world creates unnecessary risks. However, I believe that most of my smaller clients would be better off security-wise if they relied on a cloud company for their security than their own IT person. But let’s leave that argument for another time.

There's also cost. Cloud CRM applications will likely cost more over the long run because you're paying a monthly fee for all users as opposed to just a one-time fee to buy the software. Some of my clients also worry that they also lose control of the cost because their cloud provider can raise those monthly fees whenever they want and it's difficult to move away from a platform where much has already been invested.

If for any of these reasons you’re considering an on-premise application, you do have a few solid choices. What are the best ones?

My firm sells GoldMine Software.  We have hundreds of clients - mostly small businesses - who use it. It's a strong contact manager that's been around for decades. Swiftpage sells an on-premise version of ACT! software which I believe is very comparable to GoldMine. Maximizer Software has an on-premise version of its popular CRM software. Even Microsoft makes a server version of Dynamics available for those who want it. There are other on-premise options available – check out the excellent software comparison site Capterra to do more research.

With the exception of Microsoft, all of these applications share similar benefits.

They all offer both cloud and mobile options. They can be purchased for a one-time fee and installed on your server. Some – like GoldMine – only charge for users signed-on to the system at the same time instead of requiring that everyone has a license, so the investment can be much less. They integrate with desktop products like Microsoft Office. They come with developer tools for integration to other applications. They are stable and if used on an internal network may be faster than a cloud based solution. They can be downloaded to laptops and used offline. They could (arguably) be more secure. Most importantly for some of my clients - particularly those in rural areas or heavy travelers - you don't need the Internet to use them.

Of course there are drawbacks. GoldMine, ACT! and Maximizer are older players that are likely more well-known to the over-50 set than millennials. They have dwindling user bases, support infrastructure, partner networks and older architecture. The companies that make and support these applications are oftentimes at odds as to where to devote their resources between evolving their on-premise and cloud based solutions. They are more difficult to integrate with cloud based applications and costlier to support - users must download and install upgraded software when needed. They do not necessarily play well on all devices and operating systems. Their older interface may turn off younger employees.

But don’t raise your eyebrows at the businesses that invest in on-premise applications in this cloud based world. These applications, when purchased for the right reasons and used by the right people, can offer a much better return on investment than the latest, greatest and coolest cloud based options. Just being cool doesn’t mean it’s the best business decision. Sometimes old school does the trick.",
"The late Stephen Hawking often expressed concern for the future of the human species, with AI as our nemesis. Inventor and futurist, Ray Kurzweil, sees a utopian future. While futurists hypothesize away, entrepreneurs, executives and government leaders must navigate regardless.  Entrepreneur and industrialist Christian Stadil, co-founder of Danish conglomerate Thornico Group, seeks “Buddhist middle paths.”

While in Copenhagen, I had the opportunity to spend an hour discussing Stadil’s journey building Thornico Group, and much more. We explored topics from leadership, creativity and “company karma” (a concept Stadil applies across his enterprises) to virtual reality, artificial intelligence and the future of humanity. Along the way, he touched on Picasso, Kierkegaard, Voltaire, women’s rights in Afghanistan, even immortality and sustainability. (See the full interview here.)

From its co-founding with his father, Thor Stadil, in the 1990s, Thornico has become one of Scandinavia’s leading conglomerates, active in fields from shipping and packaging to media and sports apparel, hummel being Thornico’s best-known brand. Thornico is also one of Denmark’s leading early-stage tech investors, and Stadil serves as a “lion” on the investment TV show Løvens Hule (""Lions' Den""), his country’s version of Shark Tank.

Stadil’s early-stage technology investments not only provide potential for outsized returns, but also enable Thornico to be on the leading edge across its more traditional businesses. He sees Virtual and Augmented Reality, Machine Learning and Big Data as essential technologies for all businesses. “In all of our seven [industry] pillars, we’re going to work with them. In all of them.”

To discover the future, Stadil recommends exploring “the realm between contrasts.” Emerging and established businesses, proven leaders and up-and-coming talent, even contrasts between traditional societies and new values.

Stadil expresses particular pride in hummel’s sponsorship, since 2010, of the Afghani men’s and women’s football (soccer) teams. Inspired by the company’s mission to “change the world through sports,” hummel sees football as a “natural way to unite the people of a war-torn country and to develop a sense of community and a sustainable future.” More recently, hummel has sponsored an immigrant soccer team in New York “to create and share a more embracing and tolerant tone in the current global immigration debate.”

More than anything else, building positive karma and finding meaning provide Stadil’s guiding principles, professional and personal. Stadil emphasizes company karma because it works. “Meaning creates motivation, motivation creates production, production creates bottom line.”

Poignantly, while our conversation took place in late 2017, he cautioned that he was “seeing similar data points to 2007” and predicted a likely recession within 1 – 2 years. While Thornico continues to take thoughtful risks and experiment widely, Stadil and his leadership team build portfolio optionality to remain successful long-term, recognizing prosperity is never guaranteed.

Ultimately, we agreed we are both “critical optimists.” If your mission is to envision and build a better future in an uncertain world, it’s difficult to imagine being anything else. Too much optimism can lead people off cliffs without parachutes. Overbearing pessimism and we’ll never advance. Well, and perhaps it also helps to consider Buddhism.",
"When I started my micro business back in the mid-1980s, being self-employed was somewhat of a dirty word. You became self-employed because of circumstance such as redundancy. How things have changed: Today self-employment is now the career aspiration of millions, who want to take back control of their lives.

Over the years the body of evidence to support the rise in the number joining the self-employed tribe have slowly expanded. I wanted to highlight the latest figures from Studio Graphene.

Their survey of over 2,000 UK adults found:

So why do people not follow through with their ambitions to launch a business? Studio Graphene’s research revealed:

In terms of what is holding people back, Studio Graphene’s study showed 46% of UK adults said they feel that they lack the skills and knowledge to be an entrepreneur – women (51%) are more likely than men (40%) to feel this way.

On top of this, 50% of respondents said they would not know how to fund their business if they were to start one; a particular issue for millennials (64%). And finally, 13% said that they want to launch a new technology product but do not know how to go about developing the tech.

Commenting on the findings, Ritam Gandhi, director and founder of Studio Graphene, said:

“We’ve seen a huge rise in the number of people starting their own businesses over the past five years. And this research shows that this trend is likely to continue for some time yet, with a significant proportion of the UK having ambitions to become their own boss. This should be celebrated – startups are driving innovation in our day-to-day lives while also contributing to economic growth. “However, we’ve also uncovered that many people are coming up with ideas for new businesses only to see that someone has beaten them to it. But competition shouldn't be a deterrent – as they say in business, you must ‘pivot’ and create a new niche for your company. And for those who fear they lack the required skills or know-how to launch a startup, it’s important to remember that there are vast numbers of people they can approach for support to help get their business off the ground; that's what makes the UK such a great place for budding entrepreneurs.”

The ambition to start new micro businesses is clearly alive and well right across the UK. A lack of knowledge is easily remedied today, with vast quantities of information available on every aspect of starting a new business. But perhaps, what is needed is more confidence to try out ideas and see if they could be the basis of a new business.

Starting small with the resources you have available enables you to test your idea, service or product without committing vast quantities of time, money and other resources. The micro business tribe do more with less, and often see there is a huge pool of practical support they can tap into. The key is to try.

I’ve tried to start several new businesses over the years. Some were successful, others not so much. But you have to give it a go. If you don’t turn your dream into a plan and put your ideas out there, you’ll never know whether it could have changed your life.",None
"Many companies are aware of the importance of identifying and retaining high-potential employees. They see these individuals as the superstars of the organization, so it's no surprise that it would be valuable to retain these employees for as long as possible. However, often well-meaning leaders of organizations make these five avoidable mistakes in identifying and engaging high-potential employees:

Often, leaders are looking for ready-made high-performing employees — the ones who just perform at a high level without any energy or work from their direct managers or leaders within the organization. It's what I like to call a lazy management approach. High-potential employees are headed toward potentially being leaders within an organization and may not require as much hands-on management as other employees. However, just like any other employee, they need development, feedback and to feel a high level of engagement with the organization. High-potential employees are often the most simultaneously valued and neglected employees within the organization. They may be rewarded for their efforts, but without the development they also crave, they eventually become bored and disengaged.

2. Using Unclear And Subjective Criteria For Identifying High Potentials

The term ""high potential"" is a buzzword these days throughout organizations. However, it's important to be clear on why you are identifying an employee as a high potential. While it's tempting for leaders to use their gut or immediate observations to make this judgment, developing clear criteria to measure all employees against is a best practice. Notice I suggest measuring all employees by the same criteria. Solely focusing on individuals arbitrarily identified as high potentials and building criteria that they happen to already exude is a recipe for disaster. Instead, leaders should get clear on what competencies are valued within the organization, measure everyone against those competencies, and then determine which employees are strongest in those competencies. Those individuals should be within the high-potential employee group.

3. Focusing Only On High Potentials And Ignoring The Rest Of The Organization

It's then tempting to put all your focus on high potentials. After all, these employees are the only people really producing and moving the organization forward, right? Wrong. Turns out, leaders often have much more untapped potential than they realize. Once leaders recognize that high-potential employees can be developed, a next step would be to start looking within the organization for other employees who show signs of high potential. People often grow once the right conditions are provided. Explore the different motivations, learning styles and needs of others within the organization, and you'll be surprised how many other employees start to perform at a higher level.

There may be instances where a high-potential employee becomes disengaged or their performance starts to decline. Rather than engaging in a discussion with the employee to really identify what's going on, sometimes leaders are quick to move them off of the high-potential list based on a bad client meeting, a mistake the employee has made, a couple of negative comments made by others about the employee, etc. The truth is that employees who are high potentials rarely become poor performers. New challenges, changes in personal life or changes within an organization, among other things, can impact anyone temporarily. The key is to engage in a conversation and see what kind of support, if any, may be needed, and then give it some time to see if things turn back around.

5. Believing The Only Way To Retain High Potentials Is High Compensation And Promotions

High-potential employees want to be in an environment that is inspirational, challenging, unique and meets their personal career progression goals. It is wise for leaders to think of what challenging projects to engage high-potential employees in, what unique or once-in-a-lifetime opportunities can be offered by the organization and what training opportunities could be beneficial to those employees. Managers of high-potential employees often neglect important conversations with the employee about what their career goals are, what passions they have, what they are curious about and how that manager could support them. While compensation and promotions are absolutely important, they are usually not enough to retain high-potential employees, especially if they become disengaged.

There is good news: If an organization is guilty of any of these missteps, it's not too late to turn things around. A valuable first step is getting clarity on the criteria used to identify high potentials. From there, assess the entire organization to identify both untapped potential and to identify high-potential employees. Using a growth perspective, it will be important to invest in developing both groups. Lastly, start having conversations with high-potential employees about what is important to them, and start to think broader than just money as a reward.",
"U.S. President Donald Trump has released a statement strongly defending ties with Saudi Arabia amid sharp international condemnation of the slaying of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The statement came despite U.S. intelligence concluding that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had a hand in the gruesome events in Istanbul. By refusing to hold Saudi Arabia and its de facto ruler accountable for the murder, Trump is sending a startling message about just how far he is prepared to take his ""America First"" doctrine.

In his statement, Trump asserted that the Saudis are planning $450 billion of investments in the U.S. economy, of which $110 billion is part of an arms package. Both figures were debunked by the Washington Post and New York Times who claim the arms deal is much smaller with both countries refusing to substantiate such a massive investment in the U.S. economy. Trump consistently makes an economic argument about maintaining ties with Riyadh citing job creation as the primary reason for doing business with the kingdom.

Even though the Khashoggi murder has rightfully attracted international condemnation, U.S. weaponry has fueled the conflict in Yemen for years without much scrutiny, leaving eight million people on the brink of starvation. The U.S. recently said that it will stop refueling Saudi warplanes but air raids are still using western aircraft and munitions. In fact, two-thirds of the 365 combat-capable aircraft in the Saudi inventory are of U.S. origin including 171 F-15s. Meanwhile, the Saudi land forces possess over 3,000 U.S. supplied armored vehicles.

Should a relatively small number of jobs take precedence over holding Bin Salman’s regime accountable for its actions in Istanbul and Yemen, with much of the latter carried out using state of the art U.S. military technology? The flow of weaponry between Washington and Riyadh over the past decade has formed the pillar of the Saudi onslaught in Yemen. The following infographic shows the value of potential U.S. arms deals with Saudi Arabia notified to Congress by year (not all deals resulted in final sales) as reported by the Center for International Policy.

2010 saw a lucrative $61 billion arms sale which did go through. It included 84 new F-15SA fighters, the upgrade of 70 existing F-15S aircraft, 70 Apache attack helicopters and 72 Blackhawk helicopters. House Democrats may use their new majority next year to probe Trump's relationship with the Saudis and several bills could halt the arms trade. With the possibility of a brutal famine occurring in Yemen, international calls will surely grow louder for Trump to set his ""America First "" policy to one side and show the world that the U.S. stands for more than just the dollar sign.",
"You want to help our returning troops? Good. They deserve it. They signed up for the chance to risk their lives for our freedom, and many did. They’ve given their time and made a multitude of other sacrifices for, in most cases, little pay.

But assuming their military experience is enough to prepare them for their new careers is a bit unrealistic. As a military veteran and now an experience executive coach, I can tell you one thing for sure: A person’s first job after the military can require a great deal more adjustment than anyone — including the vet — assumes.

Let’s definitely keep hiring veterans. Let’s keep looking for opportunities to leverage their unique experiences on the job. But let’s do so in a way that sets us, and especially them, up for success.

Here’s what you can do:

Train your managers how to create inclusive environments. As a major contributor to successful workplaces in this age of collaboration, diverse customer bases and fluid project teams, this has benefits that go way beyond veterans. If you are lucky enough to have a vet who has successfully integrated into your company, then invite him or her to speak to your managers. They can authoritatively highlight the differences between a military work culture and a private sector one and connect to both experiences in a real-world way.

Understand the difference between skills and cultural norms. Many managers underestimate veterans’ skills simply because they haven’t given these new employees sufficient time to adjust to cultural norms. The best way to speed up that learning curve is to engage in frequent dialogue. Sharing feedback and hearing out their perceptions and concerns will help them build a deeper understanding of the culture and how best to navigate it.

A healthy respect and acknowledgment for the differences of the military culture vs. that of your company is a good place to start. How do people socialize? What is the level of formality? What nuances exist around hierarchy? These types of questions should be part of a dialogue. Remember, veterans need to acclimate to your company’s culture, but that culture should have room for their style and what they bring to the table, as well.

Invite veterans to share what worked for them before. Too many workplaces struggle with teams that don’t have each other’s backs. Veterans come from a very different team culture. The majority walked out of the military with a strong sense of unity and partnership, even if they didn’t particularly care for everyone on their team. Leverage these attributes to help foster that sense of teamwork within your own team.

Provide support. This can come in several different packages. If you’re hiring a lot of veterans or putting them in high-level positions, it’s worth the investment to get them a coach. The cost of turnover or poor onboarding can hit pockets deeper in the long run. Consider a training consortium where veterans can learn from each other’s onboarding experiences and where they can coach one another. Assign them a peer partner whose role is to help them navigate the nuances of the workplace and answer questions without fear of looking bad to the boss.

Practice open-mindedness and a growth mind-set. One of the key differences I see between what I experienced in the military and what I tend to experience in the private sector is the presence of a growth vs. a fixed mind-set. The military just assumes they will have to train and develop their personnel.

Because the private sector can often err on the side of “buying” talent instead of building it, many civilian leaders don’t have a clue how to develop others. They are too quick to throw the baby out with the bathwater, writing off an employee at the first sign that they’re not meeting expectations.

Learning something new takes time, trial and error, and the space to take risks and learn from mistakes. Those first stressful 90 days on the job are critical for any new hire. However, for someone coming from such a drastically different work culture, they can be even more confusing. Leaders who know how to coach new hires through this precarious time can help your organization get the biggest return on its investment.

These are some basic, commonsense recommendations. And that’s all it should take — hiring veterans is not a hardship; it’s a huge benefit to your organization’s capabilities. Ideally, we can also help veterans move smoothly into the next chapter of their careers.",
"Lou Anna K. Simon, the former president of Michigan State University who stepped down earlier this year, was charged today in a state court in Michigan with lying to state police during an investigation of sexual abuse by Larry Nassar, the imprisoned campus sports doctor who sexually abused hundreds of female patients for years.

In May, investigators asked Simon if she was aware of any investigation involving Nassar prior to 2016. She said that in 2014 she knew that a sports medicine doctor at the school was the subject of review. But the new charges say she knew it was Nassar. She is also charged with not being truthful when she said she was not aware of the nature of the sexual misconduct under investigation. If convicted, Simon faces up to four years in prison.

A longtime professor and administrator, Simon resigned in January amid claims that Michigan State allowed Nassar to prey on young women, including gymnasts, over many years. She had been criticized for much of 2017 over MSU’s handling of Nassar, as she deflected criticism and defended MSU’s handling of sexual misconduct investigations even in the face of two lawsuits brought by 40 women who said Nassar had abused them. University trustees stood by her until just five days before she stepped down.

Hundreds of girls and women have said that Nassar molested them when he was their doctor, including while he was working as a faculty member at Michigan State and at USA Gymnastics in Indianapolis, where Olympic contenders train. Last year Nassar, 55, pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting nine victims and to being in possession of child pornography. His multiple sentences in federal and state court add up to life in prison.

In January, more than 150 women gave graphic, emotional testimony at Nassar’s state trial, held before Judge Rosemarie Aquilina in Lansing, Michigan, who invited any woman who wished to appear in court and tell her story. Victims included prominent gymnasts like six-time Olympic medal winner Aly Raisman. “I cannot adequately capture the level of disgust I feel when I think about how this happened,” she testified.

As Nassar’s abuse came to light, so did allegations of a cover-up at Michigan State and within the national gymnastics organizations.

In Michigan, the attorney general appointed a special prosecutor, William Forsyth, to investigate how the university handled complaints against Nassar. Forsyth filed the charges today against Simon. A lawyer who represents Simon has not made any public comment.

According to the Lansing State Journal, an MSU spokeswoman said that MSU would pay Simon’s legal fees. The university is also paying for lawyers representing former gymnastics coach Kathie Klages and for a portion of the criminal defense of William Strampel. A former dean of osteopathic medicine, Strampel was one of Nassar’s bosses. He faces two misdemeanor charges for his actions related to a Title IX investigation of Nassar. Coach Klages was charged with lying to police about her knowledge of sexual assault complaints against Nassar prior to 2016.

In May, MSU reached a $500 million settlement with more than 300 plaintiffs who sued over Nassar’s abuse.

A member of Reclaim MSU, a group of students, faculty, staff and alumni urging changes at MSU following the Nassar scandal, told the Lansing State Journal that the charges against Simon were “a good thing.” Natalie Rogers, an organizer with the group, said, “I think this is the first step in a long process of holding people at the institution accountable for what happened here.”",
"Most people entering the workforce today are going to have multiple careers over the course of their lives. In fact, the average college graduate will switch jobs four times in their first decade out of college.

But this change isn’t about pursuing the highest possible salary.

People want to find a place where they can be their best, most productive selves. And when you’re working in a rapidly-changing industry, that likely means shifting roles or finding a new position.

For example, the blockchain industry is an exciting space to work in right now because the technology is still so new and ever-evolving. Everyone in it has to hold on tight to survive at times. Most startups, like my team at Chronicled, have had to pivot—and that means roles change, people leave, and the focus shifts.

You have to be nimble and willing to change direction when that happens.

You need the self-awareness to know when it’s time to switch things up, whether that means taking on a new role in your current company or leaving for something entirely different.

Personally, I started at Chronicled as the Chief Product Officer, leading our product development. What I realized, especially in those early years, was that there was a strong need to be in the market with the customer—with the ecosystems we were building for tools and protocols.

There was a need to educate the market. There was a need to listen to the needs of the market. My natural strengths and interests are in consumer-facing work, so naturally, I gravitated towards the more market-pacing aspects of my product role: bringing ecosystems together, listening to needs, gathering requirements.

It wasn’t work I planned to take from the start, but it was what the company needed and where I excelled. The switch made sense.

If you’re on the fence about your current position, here are three clues it might be time change things up:

It helps to think of your situation as you would a relationship. You want to keep growing, keep improving yourself, and continue experiencing new things.

But sometimes you hit a plateau.

If you get a feeling that you’ve risen as high as you can, it’s a clue you may need to change your role. Because once you’ve plateaued, it will begin to affect your work life. And the signs will manifest themselves. You’re not as excited about what you do. You don’t feel challenged. The job has become stale, and you can see burnout lurking around the corner.

Those are signs you should think about a change—either a lateral shift within your organization or a move to a brand new company.

Either way, your goal should be to place yourself in a position where you can continue to grow. That often means finding a role with new challenges and responsibilities.

If you’re given the opportunity to do something you’re passionate about, take it.

We often tend to think that factors like salary or title will make us happy in a new position. People regularly choose a new role based on its perceived status or the money it will bring. But it turns out that what matters to people most once they actually start that job is whether or not it’s interesting and engaging.

Personally, throughout my career, I have been less interested in working to fix existing problems. Sure, entrepreneurs are taught to solve a pain point for a customer. However, it requires a mindset that’s always looking backwards, searching for ways to improve problematic areas through incremental steps forward. I’ve been more interested in creating the future, coming up with new ways to think about existing problems with new and innovative solutions.

Opportunities to work on forward-thinking, innovative projects don’t come along every day.

So if you are offered a chance to pursue a passion, you’re one of the lucky ones. A recent report by Gallup shows that two-thirds of Americans are unengaged at work.

When an opportunity to do fulfilling work presents itself, take it.

3. Your values no longer align with the company.

Startups are forced to pivot all the time. Even established companies have to change the way they do business and how they operate in response to external—or internal—forces.

If your organization’s vision has changed and your values no longer align, then you’re not doing yourself or anyone else a favor by staying.

This is where it becomes important to do some soul searching and self-reflection on your strengths and weaknesses. Maybe you were perfect for your current role a couple years ago, but have circumstances changed? Have you changed?

Research has shown that the more essential someone’s job is to their company, the happier they tend to be with their work. If you’ve reached a stage where you realize your skills and abilities aren’t as in tune with the organization’s mission as they used to be, then it may be time to start looking for a new role. In this situation, it might make sense to leave your company. But you can also explore whether a transfer within the company—to a new position with different responsibilities—could alleviate the dissonance.

The trick is to find where your interests, skill sets, and values all intersect. If you can find a role that meets those criteria, not only will you be happier and more productive, but you’ll push yourself to grow as a person.",
"What does great look like? Each person has a different viewpoint, and ""great"" is often defined by an individual set of terms. That's why, as a society, we have debates over the ""best athlete of all-time,"" the ""best musician of this century,"" the ""greatest philosopher of all time,"" the ""most well-done literary work of our generation"" and the list goes on.

Most people believe they are better than average and fall into the theory known as the ""better-than-average effect."" In his research article, Understanding the Better Than Average Effect: Motives (Still) Matter, Jonathon D. Brown shared that people tend to evaluate themselves more favorably than others, especially when it involves important attributes. The reality though, is that most people fall into the category of average.

For example, in the sports world, a study conducted by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) found that only 1.6% of collegiate football players will move on to professional careers. Even with odds like this, the individuals who make it do things that defy the odds — and they do. What makes these people so special?

Nothing, except that they are willing to do more than average. In my time as a coach over the last decade, I’ve found two overarching areas that seem to separate those who achieve their goals versus those who don’t.

Development is often uncomfortable, and people tend to stop pushing forward when discomfort sets in. It's often said that 92% of people who set New Year’s resolutions never actually achieve them. Only 8% break through the average.

What makes these people different? First, they practice their skill consistently with a laid-out plan.

Let’s go back to the NCAA football statistic of 1.6%. What’s the difference between elite athletes and everyone else? In interview after interview, you’ll find these elite athletes share that growing up, they spent countless hours every day working on developing their skills. They did this when the good players spent only a few hours a week in development.

Think about that for a moment. Most people have a full-time career and multiple areas of focus outside of their career. How can the average person achieve this type of mastery? Simple: They find the time. They have a mindset shift. They block hours out and hold development time as sacred. They make a choice to transition. They go from 14 hours of television weekly to watching two hours weekly. They go from listening to music on their 30-minute commute to listening to audiobooks and developmental podcasts. They set limits around social media surfing.

Along with developing new skills, they develop a different type of discipline. They make an active choice to reach the new growth goals they want to achieve. They set out actions to take, and they hold themselves accountable to following their plan.

Author and public figure Mel Robbins teaches us that our mind’s instinct is to kill our ideas quickly — to let self-doubt creep in and progress to stop. However, if we work to hardwire the five-second rule, in which we force ourselves to physically take action within the first five seconds of an urge, we will act, push and move to make our goals happen, even though we most likely won’t feel like moving forward.

This forward movement is what defies average. It’s what separates the 8% from the other 92%.

What keeps us moving forward in this process is the ability to receive feedback, collect the feedback and utilize it in our growth.

The best of the best know they can learn in any situation. In feedback sessions, those who pursue beating the average mindset work to leave their egos (and the emotion that comes with it) at the door. They listen, withhold judgment, thank those who take the time to provide them feedback and press forward in their plans for growth.

It's hard for someone to constantly present negative emotions in their feedback to you when you never fuel their fire and instead provide gratitude.

Average is the norm; research and data have proven this multiple times. However, average can be beaten. It’s not easy, and it comes with discomfort and the willingness to do what so many won’t, but it's your choice.

One of my favorite quotes on beating average comes from the movie Bleed For This based on the true story of boxer Vinny Paz’s comeback from a life-threatening injury. At the end of the movie, a reporter asks Vinny what the biggest lie is he’s been told. He implies that the critics in his life kept telling him his goals weren’t that simple. He goes on to say, “If you just do the thing they tell you you can’t, then it’s done.”

It’s that simple in beating average. It doesn’t matter if people tell you you can’t. It’s your choice to put the hours in, receive the feedback and beat average.",

"Things don't always go as planned. My life and leadership style changed the day that my youngest son was diagnosed with autism and apraxia. I have experienced a variety of leadership losses and business setbacks, but nothing prepared me for the difficult news that my son would struggle to develop and speak for a significant portion of his childhood.

Kyston was born four months before I launched my startup. The business was taking up every hour and every ounce of effort that I had to make it successful. During the end of that first year in business is when Kyston was diagnosed, and it was then that my wife and I were told that because of the severity of his condition, there was a high probability that he would never talk. Since then, I found that Kyston and my business have a lot in common. They both have amazing potential, but I often have to look to see what others may not.

I also found that Kyston taught me how to be a better CEO. Here are four lessons my son taught me that I believe every leader should know.

Every leadership path is different. Great CEOs often find their path and walk it with tenacity and courage. It's always easy to compare yourself to others — but don't. Kyston isn't concerned about the path of others. He's going to develop in his way on his time. He's different, and he's okay with his differences. His difference is what makes him who he is. It's an amazing irony to me: I always wanted to make a difference and celebrate the unique differences of my business, but I used to desire to have a son who was just like everyone else. There was a turning point for me when I embraced his differences as strengths. It reminded me that the world is changed by people who can see things differently. A different point of view should be celebrated and enjoyed. The journey of difference is not usually an easy journey, but it's a powerful one, and it's one that many CEOs and businesses must walk if they are to be successful.

Small progress can lead to big breakthroughs. Breakthroughs may seem to come in a day, but they have to be worked on daily. I remember being very discouraged month after month when it seemed as if nothing with Kyston was changing. He seemed to be stuck. All of the therapies and all of our efforts didn't seem to be making a difference. It would've been easy to quit trying. But Kyston kept at it in his own small ways. We celebrated every success, even when it was small. I learned from this that a success that's celebrated is more likely to be repeated. I'll never forget the day when we realized that the boy who couldn't speak was understanding and reading words in different languages. Business often works in a similar way: Small progress can often lead to significant breakthroughs. It might take months or even years for a business to be successful, but it takes daily work. Keep working and keep making progress even if it doesn't seem like much is changing.

3. Believe in yourself.

You can usually do more than others think you can. Kyston has always been able to do more than others thought he could. He never tested well, but the tests he took never measured what was in his heart or his ambition. The tests told us that he couldn't do it, but his will said that he would. I learned from him that every CEO must believe in themselves, even when the world tells them that they can't do it. CEOs might fail and fail again. Don't let your failures or setbacks ever make you think that you can't do it. Sometimes only the CEOs who have the will and the determination to know that they will succeed find real success in life.

I've found that there are two kinds of people in Kyston's life: believers and borrowers. There are those who believe in his possibilities and others who just borrow him for a moment. As his parent, I'm passionate about putting together a team of only believers for him. These believers have the same drive and desire to see him succeed that we do. My wife and I have always believed that Kyston would not only speak but also that he will grow up to be a public speaker and be able to speak to people in a multitude of languages. My son is now beginning to talk. Every day, he surprises me with what he's learning and how he's communicating.

Kyston taught me that every great business needs a team of believers as well. I've learned that CEOs must find the right people who believe in the product and mission of the organization. There are times when CEOs may need that team around them to keep going. When CEOs find those right people, the possibilities can be limitless. My son taught me the principle that when the team gets better, the organization gets better. Don't settle for nonbelievers on your team. The nonbelievers may only slow down your progress.

Kyston still teaches me something almost daily. I don't know what the future holds for my son or my business, but I know that if he can make progress, so can I. Kyston is now a thriving 7-year-old boy, and he's taught me more about what it means to be a CEO than business school did. Soon, I'll be able to share with him how he taught me about life and leadership even before he could speak. Life is indeed bigger than business. Today, I see things differently. I'm a different leader, and because of him, I'm a different CEO.",
"Recently, a friend of mine posted an article that suggested that the way to a happier life was to practice lessons from improvisational comedy. As I perused the post, I couldn't help but see the parallels between these lessons and their potential to positively impact your career.

At its core, improvisational comedy is about the relationship and interaction between its participants. And like any relationship, improv has certain principles that, when followed, enhance its effectiveness.

Here are a few ways to apply the lessons of improv to improve your professional relationships:

Improv is rooted in the principle of ""Yes, and..."" where one partner must agree with what the other partner has just said or done, and then build upon their idea. Failure to do so would bring their scene to a screeching halt, frustrate participants and bore the audience.

In a professional sense, maintaining a ""yes, and..."" mindset means that you're curious about and open to the suggestions of your colleagues, agree with at least part of what they say, and then find a way to build on their ideas. For instance, if you disagree with a team member who thinks you should use a celebrity to market your services, instead of arguing, you could say, ""Yes, and we could also test an influencer campaign against a traditional one.""

By showing that you value the ideas of others, and are willing to collaborate, you foster a sense of camaraderie and inclusion that fuels positive momentum.

A key element of improvisation is the ability to pay attention—to the energy you bring to a scene, to your partner words and actions, and to the reaction of the environment in which you're performing. Your ability to cultivate a sense of awareness is crucial for success, for you need to be able to understand and, if necessary, make course corrections on the fly based on your observations.

The same principle holds true in your career. You can harness the power of awareness by being mindful of how you enter a meeting. Did you just come from a stressful phone call? Are you distracted because your teenager just texted you? Chances are that this will carry over into an exchange with your colleagues. And consider those with whom you interact—what is their body saying, and does it match their words and tone? Your powers of observation require focus, so as much as possible, be present and in the moment.

Improv is not a monologue; it only works with a willing partner, one who knows you have their back no matter what and doesn't monopolize the scene.

All business growth and success is powered by positive relationships. No one can be successful in a vacuum; your ability to succeed is directly related to how well you treat others. For instance, that superstar salesperson in your company isn't just crushing her number. She's made a practice of listening more than she speaks to understand her client's needs better, offers encouraging words to her peers, and chooses to always provides value even when she's not closing a deal. By contrast, her colleague who is more concerned with closing the deal than being kind has earned a bad reputation with his prospect's gatekeeper and is frustrated because he can't seem to get a meeting.

Treating others well is not just a nicety, it's an essential element for positive career growth.

In improv, as in your career, relationships matter. By incorporating these principles, you can engage more fully and deepen your connection with others.",
"Your leadership is in a state of flow. You manage your endless emails and effectively juggle overlapping meetings. You come in early, work through lunch and take work home with you. You are in control; you are indispensable. Stress is your norm, and you thrive on it.

Then it happens. Life, divorce, chronic illness, cancer, catastrophic events, death -- everything shifts. Your focus turns to fog. Control shifts to crisis. The future turns to uncertainty. Your leadership is on pause, but leaders cannot pause. The emails still come in, the to-do list expands and the work still needs to be done, but how?

Surviving through crisis is not an automatic response. It is a practice — a mindset involving these four key elements that foster resiliency.

A wise CEO once told me, “You are not a leader unless you can leave and no one will notice.” Leaders are not the doers, they are the growers -- they know the benefits of empowering their staff.

Know your team, recognize their potential and foster the learning and abilities of each of your team members. Yes, it requires time, but the investment in people pays off exponentially. When life happens, others step forward, allowing you space to breathe, step back to deal with your new challenges and plan a path.

It is so easy to get consumed by your work and your role and lose sight of your own needs. Make time for your health and well-being, mentally, physically and spiritually. Monitor your stress levels and make the time to release building tensions within your body.

Sleep is essential for reducing stress hormones and mental clarity.

Movement is a must. You don't even need to join a gym. Just get out of your chair and walk, take the stairs, park further away from the door or take your meetings on the move.

Fuel up with food that nourishes your body and mind. Plan your grocery list, prep your week's meals on weekends or join a meal service.

Lastly, make time for your spirit. Create space for morning or evening meditation, prayer and gratitude reflection.

Leadership may be lonely, but it doesn't mean that you live in isolation. You don't have to deal with and solve every problem on your own. Nor is your world only comprised of your career.

Know who to turn to by cultivating a relationship with someone you can trust, who can hear what you need to say and acknowledge all that you are feeling without judgment.

It is so easy for your work to become so all-consuming that you do not realize how little time you are spending connecting with the ones who matter most to you. Make time for your family and foster your friendships. In the end, those relationships matter most.

Understanding the relationship between emotions and feelings can assist you in navigating a crisis.

Your emotions are your body's immediate reaction to outside stimuli. They trigger a response and send that message to your brain. Your brain, in turn, interprets that message and prompts a feeling.

Crisis activates your flight-or-fight response and impacts your body on a visceral level. If you perceive a crisis as a threat, you can become trapped by feelings of fear, anger, frustration and despair. While fight and flight are your brain’s initial go-to in a crisis, they are not your only choice.

Shifting your perspective from a threat to an opportunity changes your brain’s response from barriers to possibilities. It allows your brain to move into problem-solving — to pause, breathe and consider pathways forward. It does not remove the crisis but enables you to process and provides a sense of control.

Practicing emotional choice every time you experience a negative emotional trigger trains your brain to take that pathway in any crisis.

True leadership obligates you to not just lead within the moment but lead for the future. It requires you step back, assess your patterns and practices, and create your internal and external support systems. When a crisis happens, you can freeze or begin now by developing a survivor mindset through empowering others, clarifying your priorities, building supportive relationships, and understanding, acknowledging and working with your emotions. Adopting a survivor mindset will allow you to respond to a personal crisis with support and resiliency.",None
"One of my main roles as CEO -- arguably my main role aside from setting the strategic direction of the company -- is to be a leader, the best one I can be. Being a leader is the greatest honor that could be bestowed on me.

There are two sides to the leadership coin. On one side you have leadership attributes. Attributes include empathy, honesty, integrity, intellect and so on. If someone does not possess the attributes necessary for leadership, they will struggle as they progress in their careers. On the other side of the coin are competencies. There are three in particular that are essential for leaders to grow: the ability to lead, the ability to develop and the ability to get results.

Leading is not just about barking orders or charging up a hill. There are many facets of leadership, and it’s vital that leaders are well versed in leadership principles. There are three critical concepts that leaders must master. The first is that “it’s not about you, it’s about them.” Many poor leaders want to take the credit for success. What they don’t realize is if you, an individual, take the credit, it’s limited. There’s only so much credit that can be taken by an individual. If you give all the credit to your team, on the other hand, it becomes unlimited. It’s not based on an individual’s contributions but the contributions of many others.

The second is, “the team isn’t there to serve you, you serve the team.” In leadership theory, this is called servant leadership. In business, once the team’s direction has been set, the leader’s main role is shielding the team from higher level distractions and providing them with the resources they need to be successful. Many poor leaders derive power from withholding resources. This only makes them weaker because their teams will be weaker. Any organization that performs at a high level doesn’t assess a leader by his or her actions -- that leader is assessed by their team’s actions.

Finally, trust is the undercurrent for a leader’s influence. If it stops flowing, any influence the leader has evaporates instantly. The army has an illuminating concept, the “say-do gap.” Essentially, your actions better back up your words. Otherwise there’s a gap, and through that gap flows the trust and respect of your team.

A key factor in whether leaders will be successful in more challenging leadership roles can be largely determined by the environment they create. Is that environment one that is focused on the development of others? Does it foster a stewardship of the profession? Does it drive a steadfast adherence to achieving the company’s mission, vision and goals?

Leaders can directly influence their environments by the precedents they set for themselves. If they’re constantly late, the team will take that as a cue that timelines don’t matter and, as such, projects will miss deadlines. Do you as a leader take pride in praising your team? If so, your team members will follow suit and praise each other. Do you tolerate dismissive behavior? If so, your team will be afraid to speak up for fear of being shamed in front of their peers.

To create an environment that fosters the development of both individuals and teams, create a leadership philosophy and ensure all of your team members know it. In addition to creating an environment that enables your team to develop, prepare yourself for the daily challenges of being a leader. It can be exhausting, but leaders never quit. They eat last. They work more hours. They accept the responsibility for their teams. No leader can effectively do this without being mentally and physically prepared.

The last competency is where the rubber meets the road. At the end of the day, if you do what you say and create a positive environment for your team, but you fail to get the results, nothing else will matter. Here’s where balance comes in. Leaders who are too focused on the needs of their teams won’t make the tough calls to get the job done. Leaders who are too focused on the needs of the organization will burn out their teams and not get the job done.

The key to achieving that balance is empowerment through trusting your team and building the strongest team possible. Empowerment only works if the undercurrent of trust is flowing strong within the team. With trust, the leader feels safe in delegating tasks to the team. With trust, teams know that if the leader is asking them to work through the weekend, there is a good reason for it. With trust, the leader knows if the team has to adapt to a changing environment, they will. To achieve results time after time, the leader must be constantly focused on achieving balance.

Leadership is an awesome responsibility and incredibly rewarding. If you’re a leader or are striving to become a leader, focus on developing the three competencies listed above. Learn about the various principles of leadership, do all that you can to create an environment that enables you and your team to develop, and strive to achieve a balance between your team and your organization to get the results you are looking for.",
"In 2013, the Chinese government sought to diffuse social tension by imposing a ban on TV and radio ads for luxury goods. This was meant to address the country’s widening gap between the rich and poor, although Beijing also claimed to be concerned about the effect these ads had on values and creating a “bad social ethos.”

By that time, the Chinese consumer had already become the world’s top luxury spender, snatching the crown from the Japanese buyer in 2012. This is unlikely to come as much of a surprise given the country’s massive population and its swiftly rising number of affluent consumers. According to a McKinsey’s 2017 report, Chinese shoppers spend more than 500 billion yuan (about $71.9 billion) annually on luxury goods, which accounts for nearly one-third of the global market. And Gartner expects this share to reach 40% by 2024.

What remains somewhat under the radar is China’s growing clout as a luxury brand's incubator, not merely a country of luxury consumers. With Chinese buyers embracing homegrown brands, the big names of Western luxury might no longer carry the same weight only a few years from now. Yes, China’s wealthy still loves themselves some Prada and Gucci, but they are starting to turn to local designers or foreign-based ones of Chinese descent whose work mirrors their roots and exudes a sense of national and cultural pride.

Many might scoff at the idea, but Chinese luxury brands are a reality and likely to become a force to be reckoned with sooner than we expect. Let’s take a closer look at how they are exploiting their advantages and slowly turning the tables on their established Western rivals.

In recent years, we have seen China shake off its image of “cheap.” It’s almost inconsequential now that iPhones are assembled in China -- the country no longer needs this tenuous link to luxury fame. It now has brands such as Hisense, Huawei and Xiaomi, which are changing perspectives on “Made in China.” And these are only a handful of the Chinese companies that have become global players and helped create a new image for Chinese-made goods.

Here’s another important development: Being Chinese has become glamorous. Local celebrities are replacing Western faces in advertising campaigns and even ousting the piping-hot Koreans.

If you have any doubt about the sway of Chinese luxury brands, just consider what the big industry names are doing. For a while now, foreign brands have been creating collections that embrace the local culture (especially for Chinese New Year), establishing a connection between luxury and Chinese heritage.

Global heavyweights are even launching local brands to incorporate Chinese aesthetics and traditions into modern-day products and increase their appeal for Chinese buyers.

With so much interest in their market, Chinese brands are using every advantage they have. For starters, they can now hire managers who have previously worked for international luxury powerhouses. In this way, Chinese companies get access to the codes of luxury, so to speak. They also invite foreign designers to create their collections, thus getting the international touch.

In another clear sign of their steady rise, Chinese luxury brands are opening shops next to top global players in big malls across Beijing, Shanghai and other key cities.

Perhaps more importantly, Chinese brands have an immediate access to the largest luxury consumer base, one that they know and understand very well. The result? Greater agility and relevance than Western counterparts. Local luxury players can make better use of the massive Chinese ecosystem created around Tencent’s platform WeChat, thus providing services their foreign rivals might have difficulty duplicating.

There is also the matter of capital, and that is plentiful in China. Fosun, which started out as a private equity outfit, became famous in France when it bought Club Med. It proceeded to invest in other international luxury brands and topped it all by launching Fosun Fashion Group with aspirations of rivaling Western luxury conglomerates.

As China becomes increasingly important on the international scene, its people are feeling a resurgence of national pride, and local luxury brands are reaping the benefits. London-based designer Yang Li summed it up quite well, telling Business of Fashion: “As the market becomes more developed, a greater sense of confidence in what it means to be Chinese is leading to a growing desire to communicate individualism, personal identity, and a Chinese mindset.” The shift to national brands is already underway, and tensions on the global scene might accelerate it.

Let me finish by noting that I have lived in China for eight years. I’m only saying this because I have firsthand experience of how quickly things change in this market. Actually, the speed of change is so fast that it never fails to surprise. I believe the battle for the affluent Chinese consumer has just started, and local brands have a solid chance of winning it.",
"Now more than ever, companies are learning to cherish the valuable input created by fostering cognitive diversity in their organizations. Cognitive diversity is the inclusion of people who have different ways of thinking, different viewpoints and different skill sets in a team or business group. Many of these same companies have already realized the benefits of encouraging diversity in age, gender and ethnicity for years but are perhaps new to the idea of cognitive diversity.

Unfortunately, there are still holdouts that tend to hire employees who think alike. Perhaps they want to hire an exact replica of ""Ted"" from accounting because he was so good at his job. Or, there are managers who feel comfortable hiring people who graduated from their own alma mater. There are even those who attain a new position with a new employer and then proceed to hire their former colleagues from a previous employer, one at a time, until the old team is all back together.

There is no doubt that people feel comfortable surrounding themselves with others who have business styles similar to their own. Unfortunately, when you get more of the same, what you end up with is ... more of the same. Lack of innovation can lead to a slow, painful death in any organization. Sara Canaday writes in a recent article on the subject for Psychology Today, “A culture that encourages (explicitly or implicitly) conformity of thought breeds stagnation and imperils a company.”

It would seem on the face of it that more viewpoints, varied experiences and different ways of approaching a common problem would be preferable to a team of “yes men,"" but old habits die hard.

In the Harvard Business Review, Alison Reynolds and David Lewis wrote: “Colleagues gravitate toward the people who think and express themselves in a similar way. As a result, organizations often end up with like-minded teams.” After studying the subject for several years, they point out that unfortunately, “This lack of cognitive diversity has two impacts. First, it reduces the opportunity to strengthen the proposition with input from people who think differently. Second, it fails to represent the cognitive diversity of the employee population, reducing the impact of the initiatives.”

It may not be easy to overcome these natural tendencies but it can be accomplished. First and foremost, teams, management and organizations as a whole must not stifle “different."" They need to encourage it. By realizing that there is a positive measurable correlation between teams who embrace cognitive diversity, and teams who exhibit high performance levels, companies can improve their productivity by inspiring management to provide a robust level of psychological safety for their employees. For cognitive diversity to be successful, the organization needs to make it “safe” for associates to try new things in new ways without fear of repercussions.

An important part of the progression is the role that management (or the designated team leader) plays in the process of harnessing the power of cognitive diversity. If the leader continues to allow each team member to play the part they find most comfortable, the group may be missing out on a wealth of energy and participation.

For example, if one team member is naturally upbeat and easily falls into the “cheerleading” role, the ongoing repetition of this optimistic behavior may eventually annoy some other team members who begin ignoring his input. If one member is analytical by nature and wants to paralyze other members with mounting facts, figures and research, her input may not be heard after a time.

One method to avoid this role stagnation is to shake things up by assigning different roles to different team members by project or by milestones during the timeline of the project at hand. The team as a whole will still be getting an assortment of input to stimulate their ability to innovate, but getting a certain type of input from a different individual can wake up the process and allow participants hear something fresh.

Another way to leverage the synergy of multiple viewpoints is to encourage building relationships with other teams, other departments and even people from other companies in similar fields. Working in the vacuum of your own division’s structure can cause a groupthink condition. By exploring how others face similar challenges, it’s possible to see the strengths and the weaknesses of their methods. These newfound insights can be used to bolster your own team’s successes.

If you really want to jumpstart your team, initiate some innovative brainstorming and look at things from different perspectives for creative solutions. Find some people who aren’t afraid to be different and aren’t afraid to disagree with you.",
"Being on camera is intimidating. Some people are so scared by it, they won’t even try. (Public speaking is one of the leading fears in America.) From transitioning from a senior producer to a PR executive, speaking on camera is a skill I’ve mastered. But it’s OK to admit that no matter if it’s your first time or if you are a TV regular, it can still be a disconcerting experience.

I’ve seen (and done) some of the worst mistakes you can do. There is a right way and a wrong way to show up in front of the camera -- a way in which you’re in control of how you look and what you’re saying and a way in which you come off as nervous or lost. The good news is, with a little coaching and practice, anyone can achieve the former. So, what exactly does it take to really shine when the camera starts rolling?

What do you want viewers to learn from your segment? Don’t worry, this isn’t a trick question. It should be easy for you to answer. Use that as your north star. Going on air is a hectic process filled with hair, makeup, briefing sheets and the general chaos of being on set. There’s no need to overcomplicate it. Know the major points you want to make and keep them in your back pocket when you need guidance. Make those the takeaways of your segment. Having these will help you focus.

2. Limit what you have to say.

Time flies in front of the camera, making it impossible to get in everything you want to say. I’ve seen so many experts come across as flustered on screen, not because they don’t know what they’re talking about (they’re experts in their fields) but because they have too much to say and aren’t sure how to naturally work it into the conversation.

The key to addressing this problem is to limit yourself to three main points. That might sound like a small number, but in TV time, it isn’t. Home in on those three main points and visualize the different ways you can integrate them into the conversation. That way, when you’re on air, your mind won’t be racing and you’ll have a flow that allows you to easily string your ideas together, regardless of what direction your conversation moves in.

It can be scary when you’re asked a question you don’t know the answer to or don’t feel comfortable answering on TV. Instead of freezing, keep a few go-to replies on hand, such as: “I can’t speak to that, but here’s what I can tell you …” or “I talk a lot more on this subject at my workshops. You can find out more about those on my website.” Keeping replies like these in your back pocket help you control the message you’re presenting without seeming rude or unprepared.

It’s normally impolite to stare, but when you’re on screen, viewers are going to be totally focused on you. This means that small things that go unnoticed in real life, like smudged makeup or messy hair, become quite obvious on TV.

This isn’t a reason to become self-conscious -- this knowledge should empower you. It’s an excuse to really invest time into looking your best. Pick out an outfit you feel great in with a bold solid color. Get your nails done. Rock your favorite shade of lipstick. Being put-together will give you that little boost of confidence to really shine.

Body language is everything on camera. Fidgeting makes you look nervous. Crossing your arms too tightly looks hostile. Bad posture makes you look tired. Cameras are really our worst critics. But once you know this, it’s easy to work it. Sit up still and straight at the edge of your seat. This improves your posture, giving you a more confident look and makes it harder for you to move around.

Most importantly, don’t get stuck in your head. If you feel like something in your outfit is off, don’t let it derail the segment. Ignore the feeling, keep making eye contact with the host or camera and keep talking. Attempting to adjust an earring or a shirt collar will only draw attention to something that most likely wasn’t obvious in the first place.

6. Raise your energy, and then raise it again.

I can’t tell you the number of times I’ve watched myself on TV and wondered why I looked so low-key and boring. Even if you’re typically a high-energy person, it’s important to remember that there is an element of performing that comes with being on TV. I’m not saying to plaster a smile on your face and shout your replies, just match the energy of the host. It might feel a little loud or fast or unnatural, but through the camera lens, it looks just right.

Being on TV is an exciting experience, but that doesn’t mean it comes naturally to everyone. To get the most out of your time on camera, be sure to think intentionally about your appearance and pay attention to how you’re presenting yourself. Most importantly, have fun with it. You’re the star of the show, after all.",
"Many leading voices of the ed reformist movement have started calling for an emphasis shift from policy to practice. That makes a certain amount of sense; the last two decades provide plenty of evidence that policy can interfere with practice far better than aid it, and ultimately students are educated by classroom practices, not by policy.

But when discussion among edupolicy wonks turns to the use of best practices in the classroom, one complaint inevitably surfaces: ""Why aren't more teachers using the proven work of Dr. Wisewhacker on teaching [insert topic here]?"" Why is the path from great idea-hood to widespread classroom practice so hard to navigate?

People who ask these questions are rarely actual classroom teachers, nor do they understand just how many people come at classroom teachers with great ideas to market. Yearly, weekly, daily, someone knocks on the classroom door to say, ""I've got something for you here that is going to be awesome. You really need this."" Sometimes they are ushered to the door by the teacher's boss, or the boss's boss, or the state, or even the feds. Every single one of them claims to be evidence based and research proven. Most of them are lying a little bit; some are lying a lot. Evidence can be a company-run focus group survey of ten people. Research can be a study conducted with a dozen college sophomores. There is enough bad education research in the world to build a model of Kilimanjaro on top of the Grand Canyon, and that's before we even get to all the research that wants to pretend that higher test scores are the same thing as better education (that research is also junk, unless you think the whole point of education is to a high score on a single big standardized test).

Good research that produces solid practices has a 13th clown problem. You may recall the old political observation: if 12 clowns are in a ring slapping each other with herring and falling on banana peels, you can jump into the ring and start reciting Shakespeare, but to the audience, you'll just be the 13th clown.

So how do we filter out and rescue the good stuff?

If the principal walks into a teacher's room and says, ""Hey, I've got 143 program and textbook proposals on my desk. Could you go ahead and thoroughly check each one out so we can decide what to get. You know, in your copious free time, "" coffee cups will be flying.

Government, at various levels, has tried to take on the job, but that has two major problems. First, the review of practices is invariably done by some non-teacher bureaucrat who can answer questions like ""Is this aligned to the standards"" but not questions like ""Will this actually work in my math class?"" Second, the companies that produce materials don't like bureaucrats stepping in to contradict their marketing copy.

And any attempt to get the pipeline flowing smoothly has to address one other issue--cost. Most teachers are too familiar with the experience of gazing longingly at a set of books, a piece of software, or a technique that depends on some pricey gadget, and knowing that there is no hope that they will ever be allowed to buy it.

So is there a working pipeline into classrooms? Sure. The most effective PR for any classroom practice is a trusted teacher saying, ""I've done this, and it totally worked."" Publishers and other manufacturers of teacher stuff know this; that's one reason that sales forces are filled with former teachers. There is no better source of teacher-trusted research than a classroom. Every classroom is a research lab, and every teacher is gathering data every day--not just columns and numbers but things like how many of which students look lost and which are fully engaged and learning. How does this technique affect the energy in the room? How much confusion persists afterwards? How does it play with the top students? The not-so-top students? Teachers test out techniques every day under authentic field conditions, with actual live students, then tweak and edit those techniques on the fly for maximum effectiveness.

Teachers are the front line experts. Anybody interested in education practices needs to connect with the actual practitioners. Skip the clowns. Go visit the big show.",
"Sabina Mohyuddin, a founding member of the American Muslim Advisory Council, is a guest contributor for #VoteTogether

For 15 years I lived in a small town in rural Tennessee. As one of a handful of Muslims, my vote was always intentional. I wanted people to see a person who was visibly Muslim to walk in and claim her right, as an American, to vote. I would walk down my long driveway, cross the street, and enter the church to vote.

When I moved to Nashville this past summer, I wanted the Muslim community to feel that same sense of empowerment. American Muslims have been vilified and marginalized by politicians and in the media. But since the 2016 elections, policies targeting Muslims—like the Muslim ban—have made hate crimes, bullying, racial profiling, and workplace discrimination the norm. In this environment, one can easily become either depressed or fatalistic. On the contrary, what I found in our community was the opposite: American Muslims began to speak up and speak out. Our community was tired of being marginalized and started asserting their rights as Americans.

The 2018 midterm elections were the perfect opportunity to galvanize the Muslim community into action. Tennesseans were electing a new U.S. senator and governor and state house seats were up for election. Muslims didn’t want to see themselves as simply pawns during the elections, pigeonholed into issues only related to immigration. We wanted to be seen as the candidates’ future constituents who cared about education, healthcare, fair wages, economic development, and much more.

Getting Muslims out to vote was not an easy task. There were still Muslims who were skeptical about the voting process. Should we be compromising our moral values to vote for someone who we may agree with on certain issues but not on their moral stances? Our mosque leaders stepped up and encouraged their followers to become civically engaged and to vote. Voting was an Islamic imperative—we had an obligation to bring positive change for our communities.

But voting can be daunting for first time voters and logistically challenging for working people and those with kids. How could we overcome these challenges? The answer lied in emphasizing community.

The American Muslim Advisory Council hosted a #VoteTogether party on a Friday afternoon during early voting. This was our chance as a community to get together and celebrate our Muslim vote. We arranged for vans and cabs to take worshippers from area mosques after Friday prayers directly to the party. We had African Americans, Kurds, Somalis, Yemenis, and Bangladeshis just to name a few of the diverse groups of Muslims living in Nashville that attended the party. Nothing brings people together like good food, so we catered from a local Syrian restaurant. Henna tattoos were a hit as well as the photo booth. We had games for the kids so that people, especially women, felt comfortable in bringing their kids to vote. Two spoken word artists brought down the house with their powerful verses on voting.

For first time voters, we alleviated their apprehension around voting by explaining the ballot and showing a video of how the voting machines work. A non-partisan voter guide provided more information on the candidates. Additionally, we provided translation services to those who needed it while voting. The community support at the party made the whole process easier for those first-time voters.

What I saw at the #VoteTogether party gives me a tremendous amount of pride in my Muslim community. The smiles on the faces of people who were enjoying themselves and connecting with their fellow community members while celebrating the elections was priceless. Muslims were proud to take ownership of their vote, posing with #MyMuslimVote signs from MPower Change. They were voting for women—for change—to make our country better and to be seen and acknowledged by our politicians.

Whether or not their candidate won was irrelevant. What was important was that Muslims understood that their vote was their voice on issues. The #VoteTogether party helped them feel proud as a community and eager to participate in the democratic process. Politicians should take notice: Muslims are ready for the next elections!

You can help more communities host #VoteTogether parties by considering a contribution this Giving Tuesday.",
"The massive layoffs General Motors just announced as it restructures to follow market trends toward SUVs, trucks and electric and autonomous vehicles are a shock to the U.S, economy, but you can't survive over 110 years as GM has – or over a long career – without pivoting .  Diana Lee worked her way through college in a car dealership while preparing to go to law school.  Law school never happened, though, because she was making too much money at the dealership to switch gears.  Thirty years later, she’s still thriving in the industry, having paved her own route as CEO and Cofounder of a digital technology firm serving auto franchisees, called Constellation Agency. Now, she’s helping other women do the same.

Women buy 62% of cars and make 85% of car-buying decisions, yet women hold only 26.7% of auto sector jobs, and it gets worse as you climb the ladder: only 13% of the C-suite is women – including the CEO of General Motors, Mary Barra – and “over half of the top 20 companies in this industry have zero women on their executive teams,” according to research firm Catalyst.

Lee can’t understand why more women aren’t taking advantage of the industry’s lucrative opportunities, nor why automakers lack women in leadership, especially since women drive sales (literally).

GM is focused on “the future of personal mobility,” including doubling their investments in electric and autonomous vehicles over the next two years, according to their announcement of the restructuring, with Barra adding, “The industry is changing very rapidly,” on a call with reporters about it.  Since the auto industry is one of the most innovative today, and we know that diverse teams drive innovation, dramatically increasing women at all levels of the sector would be a win-win-win  – for automakers and dealers, for women with rewarding careers, and for women as consumers.

Lee sees the dearth of women in the auto sector as a huge missed opportunity, so now she’s leveraging her firm’s platform to help more women achieve success in the industry.

Constellation Agency’s new campaign, “Breaking Down Boundaries,” aims to inspire women to seek opportunities in the sector and to follow their own path to do so.  It invites women “to make a video about their own experience breaking barriers for women, even it’s not in the automotive industry,” Lee explained.

“The number one thing” that Lee attributes her success to, ”is having enough self-confidence to take the risks, to find the advocates, to ask for the promotion.  Without the self-confidence, I don’t think you can get ahead, especially in a male-dominated industry. Because, you have to be that much more confident….you have to believe you deserve that promotion.”

Here are 10 tips from Lee’s story for how women can excel in a male-dominated industry:

“I think the auto industry is one of those industries where, if you’re diverse and you’re smart, you have an opportunity…(it) will embrace the intelligence and you can move up fairly quickly,” Lee said.",
"Silicon Valley-born Hazel Health is reshaping the pediatric care model by providing free healthcare to all K-12 students, regardless of their insurance, financial or immigration status. Through Hazel’s in-school virtual medical clinics, students receive instant access to a network of doctors for speedy diagnoses and care plans, including urgent care for acute issues, health screenings, mental and behavioral health evaluations, over the counters, and prescriptions. Using Hazel’s app, students can interact with and see a nurse or doctor in a two-way video call from a mobile device at school. This approach reduces costly urgent care visits, keeps students in class–and gives parents peace of mind. I caught up with CEO Josh Golomb to find out more.

Afdhel Aziz: How did the idea for Hazel Health come about?

Josh Golomb: The need for a new model of pediatric care – from families, schools, and nurses, is enormous. Our founders saw these challenges firsthand – many families and children, especially those in underserved communities, can’t access care. We saw the problem in schools, where students missed too much class, impacting their academic performance and outcomes. We saw this issue reflected in the healthcare system because families were resorting to the ER for non-emergency issues.

With 8 million American students chronically absent, and health-related issues a major factor – academic achievement is suffering. But at the heart of this problem is that many of these children struggle with access to healthcare. A high percentage of students in underserved communities are on Medicaid, though Medicaid is only accepted by primary care physicians at a rate of 53% in major metro markets.

We believed we could bring together a pedigree of talent to tackle this problem by partnering with school districts to bring care directly to children, in school. Nick Woods has a software background from Apple and start-ups; Rob Darzynkiewicz was a pediatric emergency director; and Raquel Antunez worked in K-12 education as a teacher, principal, and entrepreneur. My experience is in healthcare, most recently leading a company called Paladina Health that operates innovative primary care clinics across the country.

As the grandchild of immigrants from Mexico, who had 9 children, didn’t speak the language when they moved to the U.S. and struggled to navigate the healthcare system, these issues are meaningful to me on a personal level, and I’ve made it a mission to help underserved populations access healthcare.

Golomb: Hazel provides free healthcare to K-12 students, in school, via virtual medical clinics. School nurses are the superheroes, providing care on the front lines every day, often across multiple schools. They are our partners in supporting student health.

With Hazel, when students are sick, the school nurse enables them to virtually connect, face-to-face, with a doctor. The student can receive care and treatment, administered by the school nurse, and 85% of the time, the student can return to class the same day – increasing instructional time, reducing costly emergency room visits, and providing a huge benefit to parents who otherwise would have needed to find a way to pick up their child from school.

Aziz: What have been some of your successes?

Golomb: Our goal is to ensure all 78 million students in America have access to healthcare.  We currently serve 10,000 students. More than 90% of them will have at least one Hazel visit in their first year – which is the best evidence of how much need there is. We have seen a 40% reduction in health-related absenteeism in our partner schools and plan to measure the impact on academic performance.

But it’s not just in the numbers: every day we see the impact of Hazel on the daily lives of the students we serve. These families often live in underserved communities, with parents who work full time and can’t afford to lose wages and navigate public transportation to pick up their sick children from school.

One recent success is a 5th-grade student who had been missing one day of school each week. We learned that she had been previously diagnosed with asthma but had not seen a doctor for more than two years and no longer had an inhaler. We helped her family reconnect with a primary care provider and coordinated getting a new inhaler, and ensured it was available at school and the child was trained to use it. She feels better, her attendance has improved, and her parents feel incredibly supported.

Additionally, Hazel has a Net Promoter Score of 85 from our district partners, including school nurses, and a nearly 5-star app rating from school personnel and nurses.

Aziz: What have you learned the hard way?

Golomb: We believe that for Hazel to succeed we need the right combination of executives from many backgrounds – including health, education, and technology – and we know attracting great people can make or break a brilliant idea. We’re not a “move fast and break things” company; doing this the right way, and creating a new model for pediatric healthcare, is our overarching goal.

We also have to be great partners for both schools and healthcare providers that are already serving these communities. Whenever I step inside one of our partner schools, I am amazed by the amount of work and passion that nurses, teachers, and administrative staff dedicate to supporting children every day. Our role is to work alongside them and to support the great work they are already doing.

Aziz: What insights do you have for other social entrepreneurs?

Golomb: Find work that is meaningful for you on a personal level. I have always had a passion for supporting underserved populations, dating back to my experiences as an AmeriCorps member working in schools right out of college. I developed a personal passion for healthcare in my last role at Paladina–seeing the impact that access to quality healthcare can have on people’s lives. Hazel does not feel like a job to me–it feels like my calling.

Social entrepreneurs should approach their work humbly and listen to the real experts. Spend time in the communities and with the people you want to serve. Listen to the people who have been in the trenches for years. I believe Hazel’s successes have not stemmed from us having all the answers, but rather spending time listening to school nurses, physicians and parents who knew what was needed but did not have the tools, resources, or time to develop the solutions.

Aziz: That's great advice. Finally, what does the future hold for Hazel Health?

Golomb: Our goal is to ensure that all kids have access to the healthcare they need so they can stay in school. This means our focus is concentrated on expanding to new districts across the U.S. in order to give every child, regardless of their parents’ income, immigration or healthcare status, the opportunity to access healthcare and remain in the classroom.",
"When you’re running a business, the need for an almost constant online vigil; monitoring and responding to emails, messages and social media, is part of the job.

But it can go too far,  and when it's at the expense of other important tasks everything else, it's time for a digital detox, disconnecting from all things digital  to spend some time focusing on the real world. Easier said than done? Six business leaders reveal their digital detox strategies.

Alister Esam, CEO of process management firm Process Bliss, says it’s important to get the balance right between stepping away from devices and feeling cut off.

“Digital detoxing can be dangerous for an entrepreneur and for many a complete break from digital communications is neither desirable nor realistic,” he says. “Yes, it is important to recharge your batteries, but if the thought of going ‘cold turkey’ is stressful then don’t push the point too hard; do what works best for you.”

For Esam that involves ring-fencing some time each day to check emails, an hour in the morning and an hour in the afternoon, and then communicating with customers or employees via a quick phone call if needed.

“I can stay in touch with what I need to, but still feel like I am away from day-to-day activity and not glued to a device,” he says. “Reading is good too. It’s something that can easily slip when I am busy in the office, but as part of a digital detox, keeps my brain working without staring at a screen.”

StemX, a video Interviewing platform for the recruitment industry, is a global business with companies and candidates requiring information and support 24/7.

Founder Dominic Chapman admits it’s all too easy to try and hold onto a lot of this, and end up being constantly connected. But he has found ways to manage this, including batching digital work.

He says: “I set a specific time in the day to batch responses to emails, social media and group chats, and I turn off notifications to avoid being distracted. It won't harm anyone if you don't reply within five minutes.”

As a last resort he makes it impossible to visit certain websites. “You can pause your Gmail account to stop incoming emails for certain times, and there are Chrome plugins, such as Block Site, a website blocker for Chrome, that enables you to block certain websites, Facebook and YouTube, for example, at certain times of the day.”

Celia Francis, CEO of online marketplace Rated People, uses the Moment app to monitor how much time she is spending on social media and act on the feedback.

She says: “It helps you understand how you use your phone, establish usage goals and disconnect at the right times. My phone is always off by 9pm and isn’t switched back on until after the morning routine, which consists of meditation, yoga, breakfast and a walk to the tube station.”

Francis also advocates more phone calls and in-person meetings with colleagues and friends. “Not everything needs to be done digitally,” she adds.

As founder of Eventbree, Tommie Edwards is constantly surrounded by digital technology and admits that it is impossible to stay away. However, to perform at her best, she has found a way to digitally detox on a regular weekly basis.

She says: “On one day I’ll turn my phone on airplane mode for three or four hours to concentrate and make critical decisions without any distraction. On other days, I stay off social media and emails for a few hours by turning off their notifications.”

Recognising that phone calls can be a distraction, she created a special ringtone for the most important phone numbers in her life, primarily her children's school and immediate family members. “I only pick up calls with that ringtone when I want to detox,” she says.

Digital devices can be a source of distraction during business meetings, when those attending are unable to tear themselves away from their inbox.

Paul Gottsegen, Executive Vice President, CMO & Americas Region Head at Mindtree uses meetings as an opportunity to digitally detox, showing up most times with no phone, no tablet, no laptop, just pen and paper.

“I end up being the most focused person in the room,” he says. “When you have no devices, not only can you focus more deeply, but it’s more apparent as you watch everyone else only halfway paying attention. When I suggest to others that they could try it, the answer is usually ‘what if there’s an emergency?’ How did business people manage for hundreds of years without being leashed to a device?”

Joyeeta Das is founder of Gyana, the big data company that measures human activity and she takes a different view; rather than fighting technology she breathes it. “It’s my life,” she says. “Like Elon Musk, I love extreme tech all the time; sometimes it’s more alive than humans if one could see its intricacies.”

Nevertheless she does believe in the benefits of a digital detox, and twice a year gives it all up to go on deep-sea missions or complete silence retreats, where there are no phone signals, minimal food, just meditation and nature.

“My ultimate choices are islands in deep sea surrounded by marine mammals where nature rules, in places like Thailand, the Philippines or Bora Bora; that’s where I’m at the mercy of water and faith in the universe, and this recharges me every time.”",

Want a job that can take you to the top of skyscrapers or out to sea working on an offshore oil rig? Become a welder. Welding can take workers anywhere they want as it is a career that is in high demand in the U.S. and around the world.

According to the American Welding Society, the industry will be short more than 200,000 welders by 2020. And that number is projected to grow, meaning that with the right training and experience, welders can expect to find a job that fits them.

The star of our video, Nathan Swink, is the CEO of Swink’s Welding and Fabrication Inc.  Nathan started welding when he was 13 years old and now at the age of 22, he operates a company that has seven full-time welders on staff. He’s found success in turning his hobby into a full-time career.

To get your journey started in welding, take some time to investigate the trade, especially the AWS certification. Certified welders can expect to earn $20 an hour. With more specialized work, like underwater welding, welders can make up to $80,000 a year.

Here are four steps to become a welder:

Welding is a physically challenging job. It requires a commitment to hard work, respect of safety, attention to detail, and precision skills. Before starting the journey, decide if those standards are right for you.

There are many ways to obtain experience as a welder. One avenue is through your local welder’s union. Reach out to your local union for information but its common for each union to offer a course. Some employers provide on-the-job training for individuals with no prior welding experience. Training is also available through the military or community colleges.

One of the beautiful things about welding is that it spans many different industries. Welders can work in construction, infrastructure, manufacturing, general purpose, automotive, underwater, and creative arts – to name a few. It’s up to you to decide which industry is the best fit for you!

Not all welding industries require certifications; however, it is helpful to have one regardless. The American Welding Society offers a Certified Welder Program which provides a certification exam for $75. It is important to explore the industry you’re interested to determine if certification is necessary.

Two more things about welding: The industry has typically been a male-dominated field. But with the welder shortage, there are more efforts to attract women to the industry. Read this Atlantic story about “Women Who Weld” for more about their work to bring gender equity to welding.

"Tensions in the workplace and conflicting personalities have gotten the best of even the most patient of managers. Conflicting personalities amongst staff members are certainly nothing new, and it's a problem that usually scales with a company as it grows. As our company went through growing pains and we brought on more staff, we experienced more cases of disagreements, jealousy, and tension. In the best cases, it made the break room mildly unpleasant; in the worst, we experienced turnover.

A study published in the Harvard Business Review last year changed our approach to the problem. The study and subsequent article published in HBR originated at Deloitte, where 190,000 people were surveyed on their workplaces. From those thousands of surveys, a classification system of workplace personalities was born. Now known as Business Chemistry at Deloitte, having an insight into the four main personalities can change how you interact with your team -- and how they interact with each other for maximum synergy.

As you read the descriptions of these four main workplace personalities, chances are someone in your office will come to mind. We were easily able to pick out who on our team resembled each, and the descriptions and suggestions for interactions helped our team immensely. We stopped butting heads and started creating new ways to work within everyone's comfort zone.

Here are the four types:

The Pioneer: Pioneers are described as abstract thinkers, risk-takers and entrepreneurial. Their high level of energy, imagination, and trust of instinct can drive more methodical personality types up the wall. In our company, I'm a pioneer. I don't necessarily like paying attention to the small details, nitty-gritty tasks, and paper pushing. This drives my VP of operations crazy.

The Guardian: Guardians are the steady rocks in each company. They thrive on order, organization and endless streams of data. They are risk-averse and take guidance from what has been done, not what could be done. My VP is a guardian to a tee, and before becoming familiar with workplace personalities it would irritate me that he seemed to lack the vision that I had. Now our working relationship has become seamless, with him providing a valuable check to my sometimes harebrained ideas, and me opening his eyes to new processes or details.

The Driver: Drivers are -- just like their names -- unstoppable. These personalities thrive on results, recognition and overcoming challenges. They are often competitive and focused on goals. The need for logic and data integrate them with guardians, as long as guardians have a thick skin. Drivers can be so focused on goals that they steamroll softer personalities.

The Integrator: The integrator glues the whole team together. This person is not all about the goals, deadlines, and data. Instead, they value emotional intelligence and connection. Integrators are incredibly loyal to their teams and like to build relationships. These people are born diplomats, and their need for connection can stump goal-oriented people like drivers.

Creating Synergy With The Four Personalities

Now you know what these four personalities are. So, now what do you do? The short answer is, it depends on your goals.

If you want to truly build the skill and resilience of your team, go against your gut and pair opposites. We led several brainstorming and breakout sessions at a team retreat and purposely paired integrators and drivers, as well as guardians and pioneers. Once these pairs figured out a dose of patience coupled with recognition of each personalities value in a large team, tasks got done.

This is because respecting differences and working through them leads to a team that is incredibly well-rounded. Try it, and you are sure to surprise yourself with just how much your team can do with personality intelligence.",None
"I have been a part of many winning teams and many losing teams, and there is a good chance you have been, too. One of the first things you realize is that there is no substitute for talent and skill. If you are simply not good enough, you can't compete. Still, in all forms of competition -- sports, business, politics or anything else -- the party with less talent often prevails.

So, how can you build and lead the team more accustomed to celebrating wins than suffering through losses? Here are some takeaways from key experiences I have had on both sides of the spectrum:

Coaching youth basketball was a foundational leadership experience for me as a high school student. I coached eighth graders at the junior high school I attended in my sophomore, junior and senior years. My first season coaching was particularly special because I took over a group that had never won before and led the team to the championship game.

While I implemented a number of strategic and tactical tweaks that played a role in the team's improved performance, the most significant and impactful change was in the team's confidence. I knew we could win, and I drilled that confidence into each of the players on the team. Under previous coaches, these kids got used to losing; as a result, their play was clouded by self-doubt when the game was on the line. With newfound swagger and a different culture, the same group performed very differently. This experience taught me early on that winning can be a self-fulfilling prophecy -- if you go in knowing you can do it, you will.

Instilling confidence in the people you lead instrumental to building a winning organizational culture, whether those people are youth basketball players or employees. As a leader, you can boost confidence in others by convincing them that they will succeed and by creating an environment that allows them to succeed. Small wins will lead to big wins, so focus on positioning each person you lead to enjoy incremental success and your team to flourish as an end result.

On the other of the spectrum, I was the captain of arguably the worst high-school baseball team in both the history of high school and the history of baseball. We lost every single game my senior year. As deeply as I love baseball, that experience was one of the most miserable of my life. Yes, we were not nearly as good as the teams we played against, but that does not explain losing every single game. We were plagued by a losing culture that started from the top and seeped down to the bottom. Our coach was a nice guy, but it seemed like his primary focus was on the well-being of his son, who was on the team, rather than the success of the team as a whole. His nepotism not only put us at a disadvantage on the field but hurt team morale. Equally frustrating to me was a lack of accountability for poor effort. A couple of players on the team consistently failed to hustle, yet the coach continued to play them regularly, which further reinforced an acceptance of sub-par performance.

In business as in sports, the buck must stop at the top. Leaders need to take ownership for a failing culture, roll up their sleeves and attack the underlying problems. Accountability to key -- without it, only those who hold themselves to the highest of standards will perform to the best of their abilities. When you see your organization drifting in the wrong direction, step in and do so boldly.

When I was in college, I wanted to work on a political campaign. In 2003, shortly after John Kerry announced his candidacy for president, I cold-called his office and asked if I could intern for his presidential campaign. While Kerry ultimately lost a very close general election, my internship was for the duration of the successful primary campaign. One of the things I observed in my time there was that there were two kinds of people who got involved: true believers and people in it for the experience. By true believers, I don't mean someone who aligned ideologically with the candidate, but people who were borderline fanatical about the cause. There may have been some true believers who were in it for the experience, but most people could be clearly delineated. For a campaign or a company to run, both types of people are critical. Rather than look down upon the enthusiasts, I watched the professionals cultivate and deploy them strategically. It is important to recognize that on any team you are on, some people are going to be far more mission-oriented than others. Embrace those who are and create outlets through which they can positively channel their passion. Send them to events, activate them on social media and encourage them to spread the word organically. As for the people in your organization who are not enthusiasts, embrace them too -- recognize their needs and wants and utilize their capabilities to your team's benefit. When you have been a part of winning and losing teams, you understand how important a great leader is to the success of the team and how integral a commitment to winning is to getting there. Leaders don't control everything, but they control enough to build a winning organizational culture.",
"Many people seem to think being kind means you're a pushover or a people pleaser. But showing compassion for a neighbor, giving a colleague the benefit of the doubt, and spending your spare time helping someone with a project could be a sign of strength.

Showing kindness often takes courage and confidence. What if the recipient doesn't want your help? What if your act of friendship isn't reciprocated? Strong people are willing to take those social risks.

Whether your ideas about politics have changed over time or your values have shifted as you've grown older, changing your mind might be proof you are growing and learning.

There's a difference between speaking the truth and putting yourself down. Acknowledging you're bad at confronting people or that you struggle to be organized might show you're strong enough to admit your imperfections.

Acknowledging your weaknesses can also help you take positive action. You might delegate tasks that you struggle to do or you could develop a plan to help you succeed despite your shortcomings.

5. Asking for help.

Saying ""I can't do this on my own"" is a real act of courage. Whether you ask your boss for more assistance or you reach out to a mental health professional, asking for help requires humility and strength of character.

Don't let anyone convince you that your failures are proof that you're not strong enough to succeed. Instead, view failure as evidence you're stretching yourself as far as you can.

Some people are quick to show anger but lurking just beneath those angry feelings are more uncomfortable emotions, like sadness, embarrassment, and disappointment. Yet it's often easier to say ""You're an idiot"" than to say ""My feelings are hurt.""

Labeling your feelings and finding ways to express those emotions in a healthy way takes strength. It's much easier to deny your pain or try to convince others that you're infallible.

Whether you're walking away from a goal because the effort it takes to get there isn't a top priority, or you're walking away from a heated dispute because you know nothing productive is going to happen, walking away doesn't mean you're copping out.

In fact, it takes strength to step away from something that isn't working out--especially when you've devoted a lot of resources to a task (or a person). But walking away might show you're willing to act in accordance with your values--even though you might face some ridicule.

Some people roll their eyes at someone who is reading a self-improvement book (they're usually the same people who laugh at overweight people for hitting the gym). But bettering yourself--physically, spiritually, or emotionally--is tough to do.

But don't let those people stand in your way. Keep working on developing the mental strength you need to reach your greatest potential.",
"Generally speaking, procrastination isn't your friend if you want to be a success. But according to Dr. Ellen Hendriksen, clinical psychologist at Boston University's Center for Anxiety and Related Disorders, there are just three main types of procrastinators. If you know which one you are, it might be easier for you to take charge of your agenda and finish tasks when you should.

You put things off just because they make you feel bad, whether the specific emotion is anxiety, boredom, overwhelmedness, or sadness. This is based in the pleasure principle outlined by Sigmund Freud, which says that people have a natural drive to seek what feels good and to avoid whatever's painful. This strategy isn't always completely successful, according to Hendriksen. You can feel negative emotions because of the procrastination, such as stress from having to squeeze the job into a shorter time.

You consistently think a task isn't going to take as long as it does, or that you have more time to finish the job. Research by Jeff Conte, psychologist at San Diego State University, identifies optimism as a key trait among those who are chronically late. The research also suggests that some people actually perceive time differently and feel like it passes more slowly than it does.

You don't do what you're supposed to do until you genuinely feel like doing it, which doesn't always happen. Here, it's not so much about avoiding a job as it is deliberately choosing something you like better. As Hendriksen notes, this is bad news because others can get frustrated and pick up your slack, which can breed resentment and earn you a reputation as a slacker.

No matter what type of procrastinator you happen to be, being able to do what's required when it's required is a fantastic goal. If you're realistic and invite others to keep you on track, reaching that objective will be no sweat at all.",
"The skilled labor shortage is affecting companies all over the world. According to the latest Manpower ""Talent Shortage Survey"" 44% of employers across the globe report they cannot find the skills they need.

The German Economic Institute recently calculated that the lack of skilled labor -- estimated at 440,000 qualified workers -- is costing the German economy 30 billion euros a year in GDP growth (0.9 percentage points to be exact).

Business leaders are reacting in several standard ways: recruiting hard for the few candidates who are out there, offering higher pay and benefits to attract and retain them, and investing in learning and development programs to increase the skills of current employees.

But there's another approach organizations need to consider: Stop making management positions a reward for exceptionally skilled labor.

Top two reasons for the promotion to manager:

When companies promote a worker to management on the basis of prior performance, they lose a job expert and obtain a manager who often times has no talent for people management. That's how moving a single person can create a double negative -- and it hurts the business.

A better plan is a redesign of the company's career path and promotion system.

Allowing job role experts to advance inside their roles keeps great workers doing their great work and keeps management in the hands of people with the ability to do it well.

The current system is simple: The only way for exceptional performers to advance in their careers is to take on people management responsibilities.

While this system offers workers a clear, defined advancement path, the negative effects are reflected in both the shortage of skilled labor and the terrible state of people management across the world -- highlighted by a 15% global employee engagement rate.

Indeed, Gallup finds that 70% of the variance in engagement can be attributed to the direct manager and only 30% to organizational structures and processes.

There are alternative ways to build career paths: Gallup's best practice advice is to create additional paths for skill roles that parallel the manager path. These paths reward achievement with advancement inside a role, rather than with a move to a management position.

This is how it works: As people become better at their jobs, their pay and -- equally importantly -- their status and responsibilities increase.

This approach allows the talented and skilled to develop excellence in one role instead of switching roles for the sole purpose of advancing in the company.

In addition, pay structure is shifted to a broad-banding system, where the entry pay for a higher-level role is less than the top-end pay of a lower-level role, e.g., the expert salesman earns more than the new sales manager.

Such a system indicates that the business puts financial value on excellent performance and recognizes developmental achievements, too.

Naturally, that changes a company's management promotion system. And while it keeps skilled labor in skilled positions, it does force companies to reckon with this issue: how to select managers if prior role success isn't the key criterion.

Gallup has done extensive research into what predicts management excellence and has found five innate talents -- i.e., natural capacity for excellence -- best predict a manager's success:

There's no reason that a high-performing individual contributor can't have these qualities. But there's also no reason to assume she does, simply because she's been so successful in her current role.

Companies that value performance must value potential -- and discover how to develop it on an individual basis.

When companies select for talent in a position rather than using managerial positions as a reward, everyone wins.

Indeed, our research shows that managers selected because of their exceptional managerial talents realized significantly better business outcomes: an increase in profit of 48%, an increase in employee engagement of 17% and an increase in productivity of 22%.

And people are more likely to be engaged in their work and less likely to leave a company if they can use their strengths in a role.

The opportunity is clear: Better careers paths and a new manager selection system allow organizations to greatly improve their internal allocation of human resources.

But the ongoing need is also clear; Businesses can't succeed without skilled workers.

Competition for them is fierce, and hiring them is costly.

Keeping talented workers where they shine -- and that goes for managers, too -- is a winning strategy for people, companies and the economy.

Hire skilled workers into the right roles and develop their natural talents:",
"A research report from McKinsey indicates that organizations can help boost productivity by as much as 25% simply by improving internal collaboration. Pixar already knows this: It believes so strongly in collaboration that it designed its headquarters in California to compel interactions all over the company between team members. From the bathrooms to the cafeteria, people are constantly forced out of their silos — by design.

Beyond architecture, Pixar is known for a culture where sharing works-in-progress is the norm. The company expects employees to present projects in early stages, but rather than just critiquing or shooting down ideas, Pixar adheres to the rule of plussing. As in, you can only criticize an idea if you also add a constructive suggestion. This ensures that wild ideas aren’t rejected before they’re explored and that people direct energy toward idea-building instead of dismissing.

To get your own people in the habit of collaborating early and often, try a technique called Sharing Works in Progress. It’s designed to make people feel less possessive of their ideas and to leverage the expertise of others. It’s ideal for kicking off a broader discussion about collaboration or as evidence of its value.

Start by dividing the room into teams and providing a flip chart and a bunch of sticky notes to each team. For the next five minutes, ask each team to come up with as many ideas as possible to solve their unique challenge. To illustrate the type of challenge suited to this exercise, imagine that you’re Nike and you’ve been tasked with partnering with Godiva.

Don’t worry about the quality of the ideas — just come up with as many as you can. Write each idea on a sticky note and place it on the flip chart. Now as a team, identify the most disruptive ideas, and then, choose only one. Write a brief description of it on the top area of the flip chart and remove all the other sticky notes.

To experience real-time collaboration, direct your team — and every other team in the room — to migrate to whichever flip chart is to their right.

You should now be standing in front of a disruptive idea on another team’s flip chart. After reviewing their challenge and disruptive idea, use sticky notes to build on their idea with as many enhancements as your team can in five minutes. Write each enhancement on a separate sticky note and add those to the flip chart under the selected idea.

But don’t get too comfortable here because your team should again move to whichever flip chart is to your right. The new flip should display a new disruptive idea and a bunch of sticky notes with possible ways to further develop that idea. Compare the team’s original challenge along with people’s ideas and enhancements. Then, in a civilized manner, take four minutes to identify on sticky notes all the reasons their ideas won’t work.

Productive phrasing for your feedback might include “We’re concerned about X. How might we avoid that?” Or: “Curious about the R&D capabilities for Y. How could we solve for that?”

Critique is an uncomfortable but necessary step because collaboration isn’t just about more ideas, it’s about stronger ideas. In many cases, the path to a stronger idea requires us to point out concerns so we can come up with a bulletproof concept.

Now head back to your original flip chart with the Nike and Godiva partnership. On your flip, you’ll see further developments to your disruptive idea, as well as candid concerns. Taking all of it into consideration, what improvements can you make to your disruptive idea that also addresses people’s concerns? Take four minutes as a team to come up with a newly improved solution that you’ll present to the group.

Keep in mind that your solution should take competitors and consumers by surprise with its originality. A sample concept that’s come out of this exercise is Godiva + Nike’s melt-proof chocolates with energy-boosting vitamins that are marketed to athletes at high-end gyms.

While multi-layered ideas like this certainly can be achieved by a single individual — it’s unlikely that it would happen in a matter of minutes. Yet many of us spend unnecessary time and resources trying to perfect things before we reach out to others for input or advice. But innovation doesn’t happen when we’re heads-down in a cubicle or office. Conscious, ongoing collaboration get us comfortable sharing works-in-progress — and innovating faster.",
"In a recent New York Times investigation, Facebook’s leadership is again facing criticism for their mishandling of crises ranging from election interference to data misuse: “As evidence accumulated that Facebook’s power could also be exploited to disrupt elections, broadcast viral propaganda and inspire deadly campaigns of hate around the globe, Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg stumbled.” Is it possible to trust the leaders of institutions like Facebook in this age of radical transparency?

Facebook is hardly alone in facing public scandal over trust. We've seen a wave of recent scandals involving institutions that we trust with critical aspects of our lives and communications:

There will surely be another example when you next open your news app or scroll through your Twitter feed. The 2018 Edelman Trust Barometer shows that trust in U.S. institutions declined 9 points from the previous year, the steepest decline ever measured. The advances that the digital transformation promises are tremendous, but the trust crisis created by institutions whose bad behavior is laid bare by transparency is a big obstacle.

Our institutions, including our businesses, need to change. They need to find a way to thrive in the era of digital supremacy and live up to the scrutiny. How should they reposition themselves to embrace this transition in a way that is sustainable, inclusive and resilient? Is it possible to design a strategy for navigating the information age that fosters trust rather than eroding it? What would that look like?

We perform many acts requiring trust—both in institutions and in each other—over the daily course of our lives. We still rely on these trusting relationships to collectively move forward. As a result, amazing advances have been made in terms of life expectancy, poverty reduction, technology, and production capacity over the last century. There has never been a better time to be alive in human history, a point made eloquently by Yuval Noah Harari. We need to trust each other. Nevertheless, many people across the globe feel uncertain about their futures.

Governments around the globe are finding it challenging to address the discontent and uncertainty. This was clearly on display during Facebook’s Congressional hearings. The oncoming digital transformation will make this even harder as new technologies mature, including machine intelligence, gene editing, mixed reality, robotics, cyberwarfare. How can our leaders guide us through this monumental impending challenge when many of them have no idea how the basics work? This lack of clarity from regulators creates ongoing challenges for business leaders.

Radical transparency suggests that they should embrace the openness by reorganizing into loose networks rather than hierarchical systems and that the default should be to allow access to data rather than try to prevent it. This idea relies on extreme trust and willfully ignores the impact that nefarious actors can have. Is it even possible to prevent breaches from happening in a time in which the barriers to entry have been dramatically reduced? A determined actor can leak the contents of an email server to attempt to disrupt an election or as Ted Koppell warns us, could even take out an aging national power grid with just a computer, which is much easier to obtain than a nuclear warhead. Our leaders need to find a way to lead us through these challenges, but the lack of societal trust is resulting more in a paralysis of inaction than a new era of thoughtful, forward-looking policymaking that would restore trust in leadership and the institutions that they represent.

The European Union is trying to carve out a policymaking leadership role for itself in data privacy through its new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). I am far from sure that this regulation will generate solutions, but it has surely identified a major piece of the problem -- a critical component of designing systems of trust is how we treat the right to privacy. When our trust is broken, it is often related to an invasion of privacy.

So, what is to be done? It is unlikely, undesirable, and probably impossible to try to reverse the course of this powerful digital disruption. In the long run, history shows us that it will lead to unforeseen advances, but it also tells us that the periods of transition often result in massive human suffering. Some leaders have tried to earn our trust by proposing ideas to innovate or retrain our way out of the problem or even experimented with universal basic income, as was done in Finland, with mixed results. There is reason to hope that market forces will sort out some of the problems as consumers become more conscious of the problem.

So yes, trusting an institution or another person with your privacy is a tremendous leap of faith, and yet it is one that we take all the time, according to the research of Rachel Botsman. Do you trust Google or Siri with your most intimate medical questions? Does the hive mind get to weigh in on what you plan to wear tomorrow? Does your Fitbit tell you when to go to bed at night? When did you last hop into a car with a total and complete stranger—were you hitchhiking or catching a Lyft? What’s the difference? And I for one, can't break my Facebook habit in spite of their myriad issues. People will choose convenience over safety nearly every time and, in an odd way, that means trust is not dead—it’s just shifting. Time will tell if our institutions can keep up.",
"This is The Advocate—a series of leadership lessons from people in the news.

Incoming congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is forging her path, actress Ellen Pompeo speaks up about race, British Prime Minister Theresa May pushes through Brexit, Recode Executive Editor Kara Swisher says to tell people you are the best and Condoleezza Rice makes it clear women know football.

Tell yourself that you belong here.

Since being elected to U.S. Congress, the 29-year-old lawmaker and former restaurant employee Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has been shamed for not knowing whether she could afford the rent in D.C. before starting her role, treated like an intern and criticized for her clothing. “If I walked into Congress wearing a sack, they would laugh & take a picture of my backside. If I walk in with my best sale-rack clothes, they laugh & take a picture of my backside,” Ocasio-Cortez wrote in a post on Twitter.

Entering a world of mostly older, privileged men is not easy for young, working class women. Don’t back down from contributing to a world in which you initially look like you don’t belong. This is your chance to make sure your unique voice is heard and represented. Ignore the naysayers, and focus on what you were charged to do. Tell yourself that you belong here.

It’s your responsibility to speak up in every single room you walk into.

In a Net-a-Porter interview about equal wages, actress Ellen Pompeo said, “…there’s a ton of women in the room, but I don’t see enough color…I think it’s up to all productions to make sure that your crew looks like the world we see. As Caucasian people, it’s our job, it’s our task, it’s our responsibility, to make sure that we speak up in every single room we walk into.” This is not the first time Pompeo has publicly discussed issues of race, gender and the wage gap.

If you have privilege, use your power to advocate for others. Be bold so that it is no longer bold to say or demand what is deserved or should be. Be honest in what you see, and earn respect in the process.

Currently orchestrating the Brexit agreements, Theresa May is being criticized in every direction. Speaking with Sophy Ridge of Sky News, the Prime Minister says, “Politics is a tough business, and I’ve been in it a long time.” May suggested that she will not allow her critics to affect her leadership, drive and purpose.

You will be criticized no matter what you do. Criticism comes with being a leader. Don’t let criticism distract you or stop you. When things get tough, don’t back down. Do what you believe to be right.

Have the confidence to say that you are good.

In an interview with Moira Forbes, Recode Executive Editor Kara Swisher shared that people find it uncomfortable when you say you are good or the best. It bothers people when you praise yourself. It’s not being arrogant because, as Swisher says, “Arrogant is being inaccurate about your abilities…If you’re really good at what you do and you state it, that’s not arrogant; that’s how you are.”

Know your abilities, so you can have the confidence to know what you are good at. When you know what you are good at, it can make it easier for you to say it. When you say what you are good at, it makes it easier for others to believe it. And remember: Don’t let other people who overestimate their abilities steal opportunities from you. Have the confidence to say that you are good.

Don’t let people tell you that you don’t understand the game.

Former U.S. Secretary of State Condeleezza Rice responded to rumors of her being considered as the next coach for the Cleveland Browns. Similar to when she was selected as a College Football Playoff selection committee member, some people were skeptical about a woman who had not played the game. While Rice put aside the idea of being a coach at this time, she said she hoped “that the NFL will start to bring women into the coaching profession…One doesn’t have to play the game to understand it and motivate players. But experience counts -- and it is time to develop a pool of experienced women coaches.”

Point out injustice, and don’t let anyone tell you that you don’t understand something or can’t do something. Learn as much as you can. Practice as much as you can. Gain as much experience as possible. If people underestimate you, so be it. But don’t underestimate yourself.

"Our phones ring off the hook and our inboxes blow up with invitations for Elon Musk--everyone wants him at their event. Our office fields hundreds offers each year for him--we get more calls for Musk than any celeb, politician or athlete.

Musk's speaking appeal is not solely due to his fame or him being a household name. It's not because he's wealthy or his companies are changing industries and lifestyles. Between us, fame can create demand for speaking events, it won't guarantee hundreds of speaking offers--unless you have the goods to deliver on stage.

While Musk and his speaking style isn't usually placed on the same shelf as Steve Jobs, he does a few things better than the ""connect the dots"" maestro. If you want to inspire audiences like Musk, be authentic, use humor, and share a common vision.

Jobs won audiences with presentations polished like a diamond, Musk wins over people with his ad-lib authenticity. When he talks about Tesla, he isn't delivering pithy publicity sound bites, he speaks candidly about Tesla's challenges and shows genuine appreciation for customers.

In a recent address, Musk shared how Tesla was overcoming the challenges for charging vehicles and setting up new charging stations. He also thanked all the people who lined up to order the new Model 3 car and how much it meant to him.

One of the ways Musk charms his audience is humor. While some jokes are thought out beforehand, much of the humor comes off the cuff and is sometimes self-deprecating. This naturalness to his humor only adds to his appeal.

In the presentation introducing the Model 3, for example, he joked how his chart with lots of arrows looked like missiles and how people gave him feedback through Twitter. His ability to mock his own presentation slide as well as laugh at Tesla's foibles, humanizes him. When he laughs at himself, it makes us laugh too.

Musk connects with his audience because he inspires people with a vision of what is possible. Some CEOs talk about ""war stories,"" money made, items sold, market share conquered--and he focuses on how the group's work will help individuals, the environment, and the world.

Musk may not be the most polished speaker in the world, but he is one of the most inspiring. Especially when he connects with the audience, using authenticity, humor, and vision.",
"Studies show that decisions made during the first few months of a CEO's tenure are disproportionately important in determining his or her success. However, several issues -- unique to CEOs and often overlooked -- complicate or even cloud good decision-making.

First, new CEOs often spread themselves thin in an attempt to understand every stakeholder and nuance of the business. Second, they are heavily shaped by current employees' perspectives.

These factors can lead to a superficial, biased or insufficient understanding of the organization's strengths and weaknesses.

If you're a chief exec or even an executive leader:

Now that you've identified them, ask yourself:

One Gallup client learned his best customers were leaving not because they had problems, but because too many people were involved in fixing them.

Another CEO was mystified that his best salespeople were performing so badly -- Gallup consultants revealed that a lack of reliable office management had a direct correlation with their performance.

Seemingly small things can have a huge effect -- and those small things are easy to overlook. Even when promoted from within, a new CEO's perception of an organization's talent assets can be limited. We all best understand the people we know well and the business units with which we're most familiar. Yet a CEO's view must be comprehensive and extremely thorough to effectively distinguish, retain and get the most out of revenue-producing talent.

The nature of the CEO's job makes it difficult to recognize the nuances of employee and customer interactions and their effect on the business. Assessing that effect requires a thorough process, one geared toward finding the best direction to pursue using the strengths of your human capital assets to find opportunities for customer relationships.

According to a May article from McKinsey & Company, ""67% of new CEOs, looking back, wish they had moved faster to change the culture."" That is understandable -- but how are new CEOs supposed to know what needs changing? The cultural elements that matter most in attracting and retaining the best talent and the best customers can be very hard to identify.

And very few CEOs, new or not, have the time, capacity or resources to accurately identify the specific behaviors among individuals, departments and business segments that routinely motivate employees to be a star every day.

That's why Gallup scientists and consultants identify the capabilities and strengths of those in significant roles -- usually via carefully constructed focus groups and stakeholder interviews -- to identify common points of pride, purpose and motivation. That equips CEOs to develop and implement strategies that fit their culture or, if need be, reconstruct their culture.

Too few are so equipped, it appears: The average tenure of an S&P 500 CEO is five years, which is a year less than it was in 2013. That's chilling, and may cause up-and-coming leaders to hesitate before taking on the ultimate responsibility for a company.

It is true that new CEOs face some daunting challenges, but they can increase their odds of success if they get the facts they need to make decisions and set priorities. They don't have much time to do it, though -- research shows the average CEO tenure is decreasing rather than increasing. Not getting accurate, objective, performance-related insights is a mistake any new CEO can make. But the right advice and analytics can prevent it from becoming a career-ending mistake.

Now that you know the pitfalls, start here to quickly and efficiently drive performance:",None

"Thanksgiving is over. Turkey sandwiches happily gobbled up. The carcass is soup. Leftovers safely stored away. And you know what that means. We’re about to enter the high season for holiday eating: cookies and parties, feasts and chocolate, champagne and buffets. Recreational eating and drinking will soon be singing their ubiquitous siren songs. And when considering these treats, let’s not ignore the emotional upsets and resultant stress-eating that can accompany some holidays. With all this happening those without a strategy just may find themselves with a culinarily unhappy January, and some new bad habits. I’d like to suggest adopting a mindful strategy of savoring every mouthful. Trying to wrest as much enjoyment as you can from every calorie just may help avoid a hot buttered run towards Type 2 Diabetes, heart disease or just self-critical excess.

But it won’t be easy. As Lilian Cheung, co-author with Thich Nhat Hanh of Savor: Mindful Eating, Mindful Life, defined it “Mindful eating is the practice of cultivating an open-minded awareness of how the food we choose to eat affects one’s body, feelings, mind, and all that is around us. The practice enhances our understanding of what to eat, how to eat, how much to eat, and why we eat what we eat.” Unfortunately, navigating the platters ahead can challenge the habits of even the most mindful eater. All those glittery, noisy, insistent holiday indulgences conflict with the contemplative core of mindful eating.

Remaining fully mindful just seems like an awful lot to ask of one's self when yet another sweater clad co-worker brings in yet another platter filled with home-baked treats. Or when the music is blaring at yet another  party while you stand with wine glass and empty plate at a buffet table groaning with delectables. Further raising the likelihood of over-indulging is the social pressures that you may be feeling at that party. A heaping plate of food just might seem the best way to avoid that anxious-making conversation. Stuffing one’s face would at least be a useful distraction. These are not exactly situations conducive to mindfulness. Aspects of these experiences scream to be ignored creating an irresistible urge to self-protectively close one’s mind at least a little bit.

But all is not lost, despite the fact that eating mindfully throughout the holiday season really is like trying to embody a yoga sequence while skiing down a double-black diamond. Remember that mindfulness is not all or none, and so too with eating mindfully. It has many parts, most relevant being practices to help you savor your food or drink. Things like slowing down, using all your senses, chewing thoroughly, and managing quantity.

In other words, despite rampant over-commercialization, finding joy in food and drink is very different from chasing after larger portions and bigger quantities. More is not better. More is not joyous. More is numbingly distracting and self-defeatingly excessive. Mindlessly eating a heaping mound of shrimp cocktail is just not as pleasurable as is slowing down to savor the pleasures of a few.

And that’s the key. Finding as much joy and pleasure as possible. Focus attention, as much as the situation allows, on thoroughly enjoying whatever it is you eat. Really feel the joy. Celebratory pleasures really can be the content of mindful attention in the same way experiencing the taste of tea can be a mindful experience during the act of drinking tea.

So, slow down and just like when you drink tea, taste tea; when you celebrate the holidays, savor the holidays. And that means taking the time to savor what you have rather chasing after more, and then more more.",
"No matter how experienced we are, no matter how cynical we become, we can’t help falling for leaders who look the part. In business, in politics, even in the not-for-profit sector, those at the top very often have what gets described as ‘charisma’, but which in reality tends to be a very effective mastery of body language. We just can’t help but interpret confident non-verbal behavior as a sign of competence and leadership ability. But are we putting ourselves on dangerous ground by making such assumptions?

According to research I carried out at the London School of Economics’ Department of Management in conjunction with Cameron Anderson at the University of California, Berkeley, the answer to that might be a rather worrying ‘yes.’

Our studies suggested that people who exhibit the confident and assertive body language traditionally associated with leadership tend to dominate group decision-making – even when their ideas are patently wrong. It seems that, despite the development of more participative models of leadership, we are still heavily influenced by such simple signifiers as a confident demeanor.

The root of this problem lies in the tendency to associate confidence with competence. Consequently, participants in groups where there is a confident and assertive personality hesitate to argue back or contribute different points of view.

In our experiments for example, participants – students from both London School of Economics and University of California, Berkeley – worked with someone in the role of a supervisor to filter applications for a hypothetical job role. For half of the participants, the ‘supervisor’ was instructed to display confident non-verbal behaviors, such as direct eye contact, upright posture, and a confident tone of voice. The rest of the time, he was asked to appear more uncertain, speaking quietly and avoiding eye contact. Using the prescribed non-verbal behaviors, the supervisor engaged in a discussion with the student about the candidates for the role while stating his preference for the candidate who was clearly the worst choice. After the discussion, students assessed the supervisor and judged him to be more competent when he was using confident non-verbal behaviors, despite his error of judgment. More critically, students were less likely to challenge the confident-appearing supervisor, thus leading to a poor hiring decision.

So it seems we are locked in a vicious cycle in terms of the leaders we choose. We allow those with a confident bearing to gain positions of power because we assume they are also competent, ignoring the possibility that their behavior is no more than smoke and mirrors. And then we wonder why human history is littered with examples of apparently great leaders making some truly terrible decisions.

Perhaps it is time, then, for organisations to look beyond body language and find better ways of judging competence. Because the impact of body language on corporate culture – for good or ill – simply cannot be ignored.",
"Today’s marketers find themselves in an incredibly complex environment. Traditional marketing models have broken down, fragmentation is rampant, and the fight for relevance depends on adopting a model equal to the challenges ahead.

As marketers face mounting revenue pressure, a dizzying diversity of customers, markets, channels, and products, decreasing budgets, and siloed organizations, an integrated marketing approach is fast becoming the model of the future.

As the name suggests, integrated marketing is an approach that brings coherence to the complexity and fragmentation that increasingly characterizes the marketing world. Specifically, integrated marketing refers to the process of aligning and coordinating a marketing organization to deliver a consistent, seamless, customer-centric content experience across all channels.

Since content is the common currency of every market and consumer touchpoint, integrated marketing increases operational efficiency and drives superior performance through collaboration. The business case for integrated marketing is the move from a cost center to a profit center.

As a testament to the power of integrated marketing, research conducted by Gartner has found that Integrated campaigns across 4+ channels outperform single or dual-channel campaigns by  300 percent. Amplifying a consistent message drives value, and according to Kantar Millward Brown, integrated campaigns are 31 percent more effective at building brands.

These kinds of numbers beg the question of why more marketing organizations haven’t adopted an integrated approach? In more than a decade of partnering with marketing organizations in order to help them achieve integration, this is the short answer I’ve come up with: The fight is real.

We have met the enemy, and it is us.

Though it’s easy to blame the complexity lying outside our organizations as the chief obstacle standing in our way, the foremost challenge to building an integrated marketing organization is internal. Said differently, we have met the enemy, and it is us.

Competition is not the answer.

The enemy to integration that lies within our own organization is internal competition stemming from once-functional divisions within and between teams to handle multi-channel challenges. But with multi-channel rapidly giving way to omnichannel, silos based on specific channels are serious liabilities and active areas of dysfunction, and integration is mission critical.

How can we overcome the enemy to integration within our own organizations? The solution lies in the key shift from a culture of competition to a culture of collaboration. With decreased competition comes increased collaboration, and with increased collaboration comes increased organizational integration and customer-centricity.

Six milestones for building an integrated marketing organization.

Now is the time to be the first to the future.

2019 will be a critical year for marketing organizations to adopt an integrated approach, and early adoption brings first market advantage. In the face of the complexity that characterizes today’s marketing world, the future of marketing lies in overcoming fragmentation through intensive coordination and coherence. In the shift from competition to collaboration, marketers are already achieving the marketing model of tomorrow.",
"As someone who has been both in a leadership role and relied on others to guide me, I've noticed two huge aspects every leader should practice every single day. Demonstrating certain traits will help keep your employees inspired, and allow you to avoid accidentally creating a toxic work environment.

Here are two key traits to focus on that will help create a workplace that propels employees to stay motivated and show up to work as their best selves:

Your team can't read your mind, so you need to speak up and share your ideas. Great leaders should always be working on their communication skills because every single individual has different communication strategies that they positively (and negatively) respond to.

According to the Center for Creative Leadership, ""Communication is a core leadership function... You need to think with clarity, express ideas, and share information with a multitude of audiences. You must learn to handle the rapid flows of information within the organization, and among customers, partners, and other stakeholders and influencers."".

Powerful leaders inspire, advise, and sometimes have to reprimand their employees. To do this you need to be able to speak to each of these circumstances. Have you ever had a boss that didn't give you much instruction and then blew up in your face when you completed the task not to their liking? It's not a productive or motivating way to instruct or discipline someone.

Prioritize healthy communication and do your best to ensure your employees are fully aware of what is being expected of them.

Part of this means being able to listen to your employee's feedback. If you have a coworker who is struggling, have a conversation about it and find out why. This ensures that everybody is on the same page at all times.

It also can empower your employees to reach out and get assistance when needed. Or in some cases, it can inspire them to go above and beyond what is asked of them once they get an understanding of the bigger picture. Leading means providing the vision, instruction, and feedback that will allow your employees to do their best job.

That is not a productive way to be a leader. Instead, leaders should be enthusiastic about the work cut out for both themselves and their team members When you lead with enthusiasm, you lead by example. You set a tone that says ""anything is possible.""

Richard St. John spent 10 years researching 500 successful people in an array of industries to answer one question ""what makes someone successful?"". In his study, he found eight key traits that help someone on their journey to success, the first being passion. This is just as true for leaders. To be a successful leader you need to be passionate. And when you're passionate, you're enthusiastic.

This energy can be contagious and inspiring to employees. Work can be hard, draining, and frankly sometimes even depressing. As a leader, you need to be the one to continue to ignite their passion for the job-- even on tough days.

For example, if you want your sales team to drown out rejection and only focus on getting the sales, you need to celebrate each sale made. I had a friend who worked at a recruiting company where every time someone closed a deal the ran up in front of everyone and hit a gong while the song of their choice played.",
"Respect is the new currency in the workplace. Our research has shown time and again that if salary and compensation are truly the biggest motivators to high performance, organizations are in big trouble. According to the Society for Human Resource Management, 65% of employees said the respectful treatment of all employees at all levels in the organization is a very important contributor to their job satisfaction.

What makes for a respectful exchange? An interaction is respectful if it acknowledges, appreciates and gives honor to each person's abilities, strengths and perspectives. Respect is reciprocal: It must be earned by both the giver and receiver.

A respectful interaction has many different core elements that help build trust and shared understanding, which are crucial elements to successful leadership.

1. Do what you say you will do.

Following through builds trust, shows integrity and builds a lasting emotional connection. Are you a leader who builds trust by following through, or do you break trust by making false promises?

The best leaders I know stay focused on helping others succeed as much as themselves. When enabling the success of others is your strategic priority, it becomes harder to fail to follow through.

2. Measure your airtime and that of others.

You must earn others' respect as much as they must earn yours. Respect involves giving each other equal airtime in discussions. Do you speak over others? Do others speak over you? Listen and engage in active dialogue in order to hear diverse viewpoints. You will have far more influence and respect when you are calm and use silence more than chatter.

I work with a passionate CEO with a very high integrity. He has been immensely successful in his career. Part of this success is due to the fact that no matter who he speaks with, he asks for equal airtime.

He deploys an important practice of clearing the air, in which neither party withholds information that may cause harm to the other person in the conversation. Instead of allowing a prospect, employee or even a current customer to dismiss his position or thoughts, he asks for advice in the form of, ""I know you don't believe me, and I understand this. I do ask that you respect me and provide me with your thoughts rather than dismissing me outright. I must have triggered something, and I want to know what it is to get better. It can only help us both.""

3. Be aware (and beware) of your emotional triggers.

Instead of reacting immediately to an idea or request, observe, wait and listen (OWL) to the other person. Appreciating the various challenges, triumphs or ideas they present can provide great currency in a relationship. When you provide genuine appreciation, you will rarely find opposition.

Let's say you find yourself in a situation where you feel you are being attacked or your idea is being shot down. This is the best opportunity to observe the core issues, wait and listen to what is happening around you.

I once invited a leader and author to dinner with C-level executives who are part of an association I'm in. Instead of showing appreciation, he became triggered in some way by the gesture, assuming it was a ploy to wrangle a free speaking engagement out of him. In reality, I was inviting him to dinner with a highly influential group of decision makers who would be given his newly released book. His opportunity cost for that dinner was potentially losing the sale of millions of book copies, potential speaking engagements, and consulting and coaching opportunities.

Sometimes, a kind offer is just that. In this case, it was an opportunity for this author to expand his network and sell copies of his newest book without doing a thing other than showing up.

Your emotional triggers cause chain reactions that can harm your relationships. Though people will forgive you, most will never forget the way they were treated. Emotional regulation is a key conflict resolution practice. The next time you find yourself in a situation that triggers an emotional response, remember that your loud reaction may have effects that can do more harm than good.

Building respect between you and others is a key differentiator between you and other leaders. Build your reputation by following through on promises, supporting others' successes, displaying emotional regulation and building relationships that are mutually respectful.

Remember, respect must be practiced and earned.",
"The #MeToo movement has created a ripple effect across the nation, prompting organizations to address sexual harassment issues that have historically been ignored or suppressed. While much of the discourse has focused on corporate America, nonprofits also grapple with these challenges. According to a survey conducted by The Chronicle of Philanthropy and the Association of Fundraising Professionals, one in four women who fundraise has been subjected to some form of sexual harassment. With the light now shining on this serious issue, nonprofits have an opportunity to tackle it in ways that align with their pursuit of social change.

Like corporations, nonprofits have multiple stakeholders to consider when examining sexual harassment issues, including donors and boards of decision makers. However, they may not have corporate-like structures in place to implement solutions. In these cases, creative thinking about outside partnerships can lead nonprofits toward executive development, staff empowerment and systemic change.

A few innovative approaches to consider when implementing change include empowering leadership to create a safe space by partnering with other leaders, building a nurturing environment with employees through activities that encourage openness and cultivating a coaching culture for progress. Financial resources in nonprofits are often aimed at achieving the mission of the organization for its stakeholders. However, an investment in leadership, an organization’s employees and coaching for long-term systemic change can establish a safe and trusting environment that protects and empowers employees.

To build a progressive organization, executives, managers and third parties need to address sexual harassment head-on and establish a clear understanding of what can be done to prevent it. It is valuable to invest in improving the communication skills of an organization’s leaders, nurturing employee rights and bringing in a third party to guide the development of a respectful workplace environment.

Leaders have to consider their employees when making decisions and hold themselves accountable when carrying them out. But moving forward with change on your own can be challenging. Accountability can be achieved through partnerships with other leaders or a coach who can help you develop insight into different approaches and develop the confidence to instill and nurture a positive work environment.

Overall, leaders can help employees feel empowered by encouraging them to openly communicate, ask powerful questions and influence solution-based thinking. Team-building activities can also be facilitated to build cooperation, trust and confidence within an organization, helping employees understand, navigate and address systemic challenges, including gender bias.

Women have always looked out for the good of others. With the #MeToo movement giving women a platform for their voices to be heard, they are increasingly advocating for themselves as well.

Employees need to feel like work is a safe space for them, where they can discuss difficult subjects like sexual harassment. If an employee feels empowered by their leaders, both parties can prevent issues from arising by tackling them head-on. This will lead to a healthy work environment, rather than having an employee publicly complain or leave a company out of fear.

Sexual harassment incidents need acknowledgment, a strong sense of community in the workplace and an outlet for people to discuss boundaries freely. Leadership development, employee advocacy and coaching can empower leaders to support staff, influence collective activism and create a ripple effect that influences a supportive environment in the long term.

In the era of #MeToo, the subject of sexual harassment cannot be ignored. While women are speaking up more, some do not, especially when it comes to security at work. Women may feel hesitant to speak up for fear of upsetting their co-workers, causing tension, stunting their career growth or losing their jobs. Partnering with other leaders can create more accountability and empower leaders to create an open and comfortable workplace prepared for progress.

The #MeToo movement has become a topic that organizations, including nonprofits, need to address and work toward preventing. The attention it has garnered and the weight it holds has urged organizations to #PressForProgress.

There is no perfect approach to preventing sexual harassment, but investing in third-party resources such as coaching, engaging the community of leaders and creating a safe and open space can lead to thoughtful organizations that enable employees to enter open discussions, collaborate and better communicate in difficult situations. These are tools that can help employees feel protected and build a sustainable environment for the future.",
"Employees enjoy hearing praise from their leaders, and those who are recognized are more likely to be productive and satisfied at work. According to Gallup’s research, “Only 41% of employees strongly agree that they know what their company stands for and what makes it different from competitors.”

A concern that I find leaders and companies often struggle with is how to enable their employees to produce good work. Great companies produce great work. Their leaders select people who focus on making the right actions that will achieve goals and produce results.

American writer and philosopher Elbert Hubbard once wrote, “The best preparation for good work tomorrow is to do good work today.” Every day provides an opportunity to do good work. However, many people waste their days at work producing nothing of value, therefore missing out on opportunities to leave a legacy.

1. Some people think that their work is not important.

When an employee believes this, this is an attitude of avoidance that must be redirected.

Many people get used to doing the same tasks repeatedly. They never look beyond their current reality to see the possibilities of other work they could complete. It is the employee’s responsibility to learn the “why” behind the tasks they are to accomplish.

Leaders can help encourage this by constantly reminding the team of the overall mission of the organization and by sharing success stories from customers when the team delivered above expectations. These steps can remind everyone about the value of their work in the organization.

2. Some people feel they are too important to do the work.

When an employee believes this, this is an attitude of arrogance, and this must be corrected.

Many people are hired to do tasks, but some may feel they are too important to do the work that others in the organization could perform. These individuals become “silo thinkers,” which is contrary to an organization’s need for everyone to be involved and engaged.

The attitude of a great worker is to do their best with the work in front of them. Leaders should encourage people to express why other team members are important and seek to find opportunities where people can work on cross-departmental teams to enhance relationships and knowledge of others outside of their own area.

3. Some people feel like they have more important work to do.

When an employee believes this, this is an attitude of ambition, and this must be tamed.

Some workers don’t complete a particular task because they feel they have more important work to finish. But sometimes, the best work is the perfection of a simple task. In an organization, all work is important work. Writer Laura Ingalls Wilder has been credited with saying “Every job is good if you do your best and work hard. A man who works hard stinks only to the ones that have nothing to do but smell.”

Leaders must elevate clarity to the team to communicate the areas of high priority to the organization. This will release high performers to work in areas that are mission critical and discourage team members from only working on the tasks that they feel are the most critical.

4. Some people feel like they know better regarding what work is essential.

When an employee believes this, this is an attitude of authority, and this must be managed.

These employees have a disconnect between the leadership and the leader’s perspective. These workers may think they know better than the leader when it comes to what needs to be done, and they may believe the leader is wrong to place a higher value on some work than what the employees feel should take priority. These individuals often wrestle with who is in charge.

In every organization, the task of the leader is of utmost importance. The leader sets the agenda and communicates the value of work. Every organization needs to be clear about the most crucial tasks of serving customers and producing results.

One successful activity that many leaders practice is asking each person on the team to list the most important aspect of their job or their performance. The leader should make a list of every answer and then communicate the absolute top responsibility for that department or organization. The leader must strive for clarity in order for team members to have clarity about their responsibilities and performance expectations.

Every great organization produces great work. As legendary English poet, essayist and literary historian Samuel Johnson has been credited with saying, “Great works are performed not by strength but by perseverance.” Every job and task have the potential to produce great work. The leader and the employees must take responsibility to find the right perspective to accomplish great work.",
"Many entrepreneurs who are looking to build successful startups are incredibly talented and intelligent, but they are missing the key ingredients that have the potential to turn their startups that no one cares about into startups that are bound for success. It all starts with the team and the culture. And that’s not all. If you’re looking to raise money from investors, it is also about being the best in your industry.

As a founder and an advisor to many of the top incubators around the world, I'd like to share my winning experience. Here are a few things to keep in mind when building your startup. When you want to scale up, this strong foundation will make it much more feasible.

Building a startup isn’t easy and there are many stages involved in growing a large-scale business. This requires a lot of informative decision making that can’t be done by a single person. The startup is going to have its ups and downs -- so having a team and co-founder to navigate through that is incredibly important.

Finding a co-founder is much like dating. You can’t just pick them up at a nightclub and hope they will be the one for you. I recommend using websites like CoFoundersLab, AngelList and even LinkedIn to vet potential founders who would be a good fit for your business.

The same due diligence is required when building out the rest of your team. I learned how to take it slow during the interview process until I was able to build a relationship with candidates and see their true colors. It is more about chemistry than it is about finding someone who is simply knowledgeable. You want them to be able to work through the difficult times that come with a scaling business.

Many startups believe they have to be in Silicon Valley to live out their dream and build a sustainable company. This is simply not true. There are many investors in Silicon Valley, without a doubt, but at the end of the day, nobody cares where you are located. If you are building the best product or service in your industry, then you will be sought after. Investors will literally come knocking on your door. For example, many successful startups such as Hootsuite, Vidyard, Influitive and others are located outside of Silicon Valley.

It is all about building a strong technical infrastructure and automating the rest of your business. Invest in the tools that will help your company scale, not the location. It is my belief that location has always hindered founders who aren’t being honest with themselves about whether they are really the best at what they do.

After working with over 200 startups, I have noticed that many startup CEOs are brilliant but lack the skills it takes to really understand their team members. Whether they need glasses or not, putting on people glasses is about seeing things they currently aren’t seeing to prevent new issues from occurring. Some tangible ways founders can see the perspectives of their team members is by simply getting involved and listening to them about their career and personal goals.

I once worked with a company where the founder asked every team member to have a side hustle before joining. He had a separate channel in Slack where everyone could discuss their side hustle. This was a way for them to bond, but it also helped team members plan for the future and always have something to fall back on.

Founders can support their team members’ pursuit of their goals by allowing them to be more open about them. It doesn’t have to be about your company all the time. When you focus on building a company that focuses on their team, everyone wins. People glasses allow CEOs to focus on providing team members with the resources and flexibility they need to succeed.

This is the year to take your startup from failing to winning. You don’t have to be in Silicon Valley to achieve that. Success is possible when you focus on your tools and your team.",
"Inc.com columnist Alison Green answers questions about workplace and management issues--everything from how to deal with a micromanaging boss to how to talk to someone on your team about body odor.

My employer is asking all of us to decorate our offices or work areas for Christmas this year. The decorations are provided, and she thinks it will brighten up the office. I work as an administrative assistant in the front of the office. Because of some difficult personal reasons, I will not be celebrating Christmas this year, and, honestly, the sight of anything holiday-related makes me sad. Would I be out of line if I refused to put up decorations?

If you wanted to refuse to decorate your own personal workspace on religious grounds (such as being of a different faith or belonging to a branch of Christianity that finds Santa frivolous or counter to the true meaning of the holiday, or so forth), you'd be well within your rights to decline to participate on those grounds. Federal law requires employers to make ""reasonable accommodations"" on religious grounds (including lack of religious faith) as long as it doesn't cause them undue hardship, and having you opt out from decorating your work area certainly wouldn't cause your employer hardship.

However, it doesn't sound like your objections are religious in nature, and because it sounds like your desk is in the reception area, it's a little different anyway. It's reasonable for a business to decide it wants to decorate its front office for the holidays, and ultimately that area isn't just your workspace -- it's also the company's reception area where it greets visitors.

That means that it's possible that the company's going to hold firm on its holiday decorating plans. But you can certainly float the idea of opting out by saying something like, ""I'm not participating in the holidays this year for personal reasons. Would you mind if I didn't put up decorations in my area?"" That might take care of it! But it's also possible that even a reasonable manager could reply to that with, ""It's fine to keep the decorations out of your immediate desk area, but we do want to decorate the reception area where you're located."" If that's the response, there's not a lot you can do at that point, particularly not without pushing the issue further than will appear reasonable.

However, if that happens, are there decorations that might feel less Christmasy and therefore more workable to you? For example, could you go for more of a winter theme -- snowflakes, greenery, and so forth? Or arrange them so that you won't have to look at them all day long? Or even see if someone else will volunteer to do the decorating so that you're not actively participating in it? There might be compromises here that will feel more livable to you.",None
"Let me guess. You want to be happy. Me, too. But that long-standing idea that working fewer hours is some magic pill for joy--or conversely, that too much work is the quick route to the blahs--might just dissolve into nothing. That's based on data from the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) and the 2018 World Happiness Report (WHR).

As a starting point, as summarized in a blog and infographic from BambooHR, OECD data shows that the average number of hours worked per week in the United States is 34. This is despite the increasingly common assertion that people in America area working more than ever before--almost half of small business owners say they clock more than 50 hours weekly. America ranks #18 on the WHR.

Like those in America, people in Switzerland and Germany work an average of 34 hours a week. But the WHR ranks for the latter two countries are #5 and #15, respectively.

If you want to look at the data in a slightly different way, the country with the highest happiness rank (Finland) has workers clocking 36 hours on average. But workers are clocking that same number of hours in Italy, too, where the WHR is only #47. Or consider that Turkey and Columbia rank #74 and #37 on the WHR, even though they both have a work hour average of 48. And the country with the lowest average number of hours per week, the Netherlands (29 hours), sits at #6 on the WHR.

No matter how you slice it, the data reveals that there's really very little correlation between how much you work and your overall level of happiness. That's because, while your work of course does influence your life, there's a lot more to happiness than going to or staying away from the office. The WHR points out some of the factors they take into consideration in rankings, for example. The happiest countries support all six elements that support wellbeing (income, healthy life expectancy, social support, freedom, trust and generosity).

""a ranking of countries according to the happiness of their immigrant populations is almost exactly the same as for the rest of the population. [...] The closeness of the two rankings shows that the happiness of immigrants depends predominantly on the quality of life where they now live, illustrating a general pattern of convergence. Happiness can change, and does change, according to the quality of the society in which people live. Immigrant happiness, like that of the locally born, depends on a range of features of the social fabric, extending far beyond the higher incomes traditionally thought to inspire and reward migration. The countries with the happiest immigrants are not the richest countries, but instead the countries with a more balanced set of social and institutional supports for better lives.""

So here's the bottom line for you as an entrepreneur or leader: It's not really how much you're working, but why and how. It's context. You can be miserable working 20 hours a week if you're in crappy conditions, or you can be ecstatic working 80 hours because you've got great circumstances. And as your company expands and changes, you should be highly aware that reducing or increasing hours isn't a universal way to boost morale.

All this said, according to a 2017 market report, while you can't assume they're always the happiest, countries with the least working hours do tend to be ranked as the most productive. So let go of the idea that you have to work your employees to the bone to get amazing results. If they've met your goals in 4 hours instead of 8, that's to your financial advantage. Take only what you need to achieve rational, realistic goals and let them have control of the rest.",
"The personality traits that drive people to open their own businesses may not always match the qualities that make for entrepreneurial success, a recent study suggests.

Entrepreneurship may appeal to open-minded people who enjoy the autonomy, but they're not necessarily likely to succeed, according to the research. Extroverts, on the other hand, appear more likely to run profitable ventures.

Researchers at Washington University in St. Louis, Johns Hopkins University and the University of Delhi sought to discover whether personality differences explain which individuals become entrepreneurs and, among that group, which ones succeed.

""Most small businesses fail, but it is unclear why some individuals are successful entrepreneurs while others are not,"" the authors note in their National Bureau of Economic Research working paper, ""The Right Stuff? Personality and Entrepreneurship.""

Previous research, they note, recognizes that workers may choose self-employment for the non-financial benefits associated with running a business, that is, because they enjoy it, ""and not necessarily because they are good at it.""

Looking into the ways key personal qualities affect both the choice to become self-employed and entrepreneurial returns, or profits, the researchers developed a model showing that ""the personality traits that make entrepreneurship profitable are not always the same traits driving people to open a business.""

This finding has important consequences for entrepreneurship policies, they write.

""For example, subsidies for small businesses do not attract talented-but-reluctant entrepreneurs, but instead attract individuals with personality traits associated with strong preferences for running a business and low-quality business ideas,"" the authors say.

A ""lifestyle entrepreneur"" may open a business based on a low-quality idea because he enjoys the autonomy of being his own boss, they write. On the other hand, a ""reluctant entrepreneur"" may show an aversion to entrepreneurship despite possessing the qualities for productive self-employment.",
"I’m sure I won’t surprise you if I write that smart use of technology is an integral part of success in business today. We live in the digital era—using mobile devices to create, cloud computing to collaborate, cognitive computing and artificial intelligence to improve operations, and data analysis to extract key insights. And that’s just scratching the surface.

I’m not sure, however, that most people recognize how technology can help make a good company great, and great business owners—and hopefully, their teams—wealthy.

Last month, my team at Fundera released a report called “10 Businesses to Start Now to Be Rich in a Decade.” The report aggregated and analyzed data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, market research firms, and investment firms—and determined 10 industries expected to generate high levels of job growth, revenue, and output in the next decade.

Basically, if you’re looking to start a lucrative business that will stand the test of time, something in these 10 areas would be a good bet.

The number one industry? Technology, of course. Tech companies capture nearly half of all venture capital dollars, and forecast output growth is at 135%. Cloud computing, machine learning and AI, and big data were cited as the sub-sectors that will make the biggest impact.

But as you continue down the list, the same common denominator jumps out at you: Regardless of industry, a major reason for that industry’s expected success is how technology has changed, and will continue to change, its trajectory.

Take the number two industry: Health. While many hospitals and primary care facilities are in crisis, facing downturns in profitability (particularly in rural areas), the health industry’s overall future output looks strong thanks to the subsectors of biotech, health data management, and personalized health solutions—which is based on the idea that your health data will drive your immediate and long-term treatment options. Personalizing health care as we have personalized entertainment and hospitality is guaranteed to be a gold mine.

Every industry on the list is in some way powered by the gains that technology, in particular, will bring. For energy, it’s the increasing use and efficiency of sustainable energy sources, and the concept of “energy trading” via tech devices. For finance, it’s financial tech or cryptocurrency. For real estate, it’s flat-fee online brokerages and other disruptors that will alter the course of this late-blooming industry (at least as far as tech innovation is concerned).

Even so-called legacy industries (retail, construction, and hospitality), which have been around for generations, vaulted up the list due to the incredible upside that tech innovations afford them.

So what does this mean for budding entrepreneurs, and anyone else looking to enter any of the industries we highlighted as potential next-decade winners?

The goal should not be to pivot into one of these top 10 industries if you have a completely different kind of business, or to invest needlessly in tech products and platforms just to feel tech-savvy (companies can suffer heavy losses or even go bankrupt by investing in the wrong technology at the wrong time).

If you’re a business owner in 2018, you’re probably already using tech in some way. It’s either an integral part of your business—you run an e-commerce site, or a digital marketing agency—or you use digital platforms that have become tools of the trade for any modern business, such as G Suite for collaborating on documents or Slack to communicate.

Instead, we should be thinking critically about how technology can continue to improve our existing operations. What do we do now that could be done better by automated processes, software, or artificial intelligence?

For example, a report from Gartner on strategic technology trends in 2018 noted that the use of narrow AI (“consisting of highly scoped machine-learning solutions that target a specific task … with algorithms chosen that are optimized for that task”) is on the rise. Applications that use narrow AI technology can do things like fill out your tax forms, book flights and hotels, recognize customers and provide them with a personalized experience, and plan your day—all by using existing data and previous preferences.

Narrow AI isn’t just for simple tasks—it’s the current basis for self-driving cars—but it’s the perfect example of an emerging technology that is being used in an expanding number of business tools, platforms, and services to help humans focus on higher-level tasks like decision-making, problem-solving, and communication.

Other examples include even simpler shifts, such as switching from desktop-based to cloud-computing software, or moving away from manual processes for tracking inventory and assets to management software. The companies that can offload essential but time-consuming or otherwise menial tasks—including planning, bookkeeping, and auditing—will be the ones that win.

We still have a long way to go to see how exactly Fundera’s report on future industries will play out. But I feel pretty confident in predicting that technology will play a role in helping companies of the future succeed. The only question is, how will they use technology, and what forms will it take? Whether you work in transportation, retail, or the wide field of tech in general—or another field that is being augmented by digital tools—the results are bound to be fascinating.",
"Last week I was doing some strategic planning for my own business in preparation for 2019. The next day, as I thought about some of the plans I'd mapped out for myself, I started to feel anxious.

So I started to think through how I could scale back on the activities I knew would be beneficial in helping me grow my business. No bueno. A few days later, I realized the root of the anxiety I felt: fear.

Fear was causing me to play small. Thankfully, I snapped out of it and went to my go-to method for helping me overcome fear to attack the big goals I have for my business. Here are four steps you can take to overcome any fears that may be standing in the way between you and a breakout 2019.

It's easy to go into a new year doing the same activities you did the previous year. But if you want to improve upon the results you earned in 2018, you'll have to shake things up a bit.

That means getting bold with the goals you set for yourself. Instead of writing down all the things you think you should be doing, spend some time dreaming about the activities that would help you make significant progress toward achieving your mission. Brainstorm the activities you would do if you could wave a magic wand and implement your ideas flawlessly.

Don't focus on how you'll do it or any existing constraints that exist during this step. Just imagine the possibilities and set goals for your business that will allow you to stand out and make a bigger impact for the customers you serve.

2. Identify who you need to become to accomplish your goals.

To achieve the bigger goals you set for yourself, you've got show up differently. You've got to establish and nurture the habits, processes, and company culture that will enable you to execute the tasks and activities necessary to reach your big goals.

For me, that meant I needed to hire a team of people to take on the work I couldn't do myself, or that I shouldn't be doing, so I could focus my time and energy on the right tasks.

3. Specify your non-negotiables along the way.

You don't want to build a business that gives you a life that you hate. But that can be totally possible if you don't set up some boundaries for yourself regarding the way you want to work and live.

For my business, my non-negotiables include making time to work out each day and to eat right. It also means taking proper vacations, not working through the weekends, and not working with clients I'm not excited about.

When you establish operating norms for both you and your team, it makes it easier for you to design the way you work in a manner that supports everyone living and performing at their best.

Most of us experience fear, especially when we're faced with the prospect of doing something new. Fear can only defeat you if it paralyzes you or prevents you from stepping outside your comfort zone to do something that will help you grow.",
"These days, customer engagement all comes down to good content. Whether your company is crafting blog posts or producing videos, content is the name of the game as far as reaching your target audience goes. Well-crafted content has the ability to drive customers straight to your company door. Even further, niche content brings in specific clients who are already loyal to your vision or goal.

There are a million pieces of content marketing advice out there. It can be difficult to know which strategies will be the most effective and garner the most audience engagement. To help, these eight members of Young Entrepreneur Council share the content they’ve seen succeed, along with practical marketing steps to drive more content-based traffic.

We produce studies that analyze the sleeping habits of thousands of consumers to get a better understanding of the positive and negative implications of certain behaviors. We summarize our findings in an easy-to-digest manner that helps to educate audiences about smarter ways to sleep. As a result, we often identify interesting correlations between sleep and happiness, sleep and health, and sleep and productivity that are both insightful and newsworthy. Our studies generate the most engagement for us because many news sites, blogs and influencers link to and share our reports, providing us with free publicity and reach. For other brands, I recommend producing original surveys to share unique data they may find within their respective categories or industries. - Firas Kittaneh, Amerisleep

We have increasingly mandated that our clients convert their conventional blogging to long-form content blogging and industry writing. One particularly successful example of long-form content is industry guides that are often 3-4K words. From these guides, that are both useful internally for marketing and awareness, and externally for SEO, we observe increases in SEO traffic and engagement. Certain industries are highly competitive in this realm, such as health and beauty, but long-form SEO still competes in this arena, a signal of its rise and longevity. - Matthew Capala, Alphametic

User-generated content that we report has resulted in high engagement. This isn't surprising because even though we are acknowledging one individual, that individual reflects our customer base and how they see and respond to our brand. We highly encourage our customers to share their experiences with our product, whether it is through reviews or direct social media posts. This opens an avenue for us to engage with them and share their take with our community, which builds trust and unity. It also becomes a way for us to learn more about how they respond to our products and, in turn, we can iterate and most importantly make sure that they feel heard. Our customers come first so the more we build a relationship with them, the more they become part of our journey. - Stephanie Vermaas, THIS IS A LOVE SONG LLC

The two-way street of social media gives you easy means to interact with your target audience in different ways. However, it is important that you follow a pronged approach. Polls are now part of popular social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Using polls works well in capturing user attention, and they’re very effective conversation starters. Quizzes are another way to get people to click through to your website. But make the quizzes you share via social media informal and fun. When done right, both can increase user engagement significantly. Videos are among the most engaging forms of online content as of today, and there appears to be no slowing down in their upward trend anytime soon. Professional photos and infographics might require your attention, too. - Derek Robinson, Top Notch Dezigns

We found that when we write content that somehow relates to current world events, it creates a lot more engagement than when it's general ""evergreen"" content. For example, if you are writing content for a client in the home improvement vertical, a blog post entitled ""5 Ways to Protect Your Home From a Hurricane"" would do way better than a general title like ""5 Ways to Make Your Home More Secure."" People tend to keep up with the news in their region, and they like to discuss the news on social media, especially if they feel a personal or emotional connection to the topic. Taking advantage of trending and popular hashtags on Twitter is also a great way to ensure your content is seen and put in front of a relevant audience. - Amine Rahal, IronMonk

For our audience of founders of companies in the early stages of their lifecycle (at or just before their first institutional round), we find that “how to” still draws the most attention. How to build a pitch deck, how to get your books ready for due diligence, how to identify the right sources of funding who understand your industry and business model -- all of these get great engagement whether we offer them in blogs, webinars, panels or presentations. Even for experienced entrepreneurs, each startup is new and our breadth of clients means our team may have seen scenarios that they have not yet. Advice? Go with what you know, with what makes you distinctive. - David Ehrenberg, Early Growth Financial Services

7. Content That Adds Value And Humor

Everybody is going through something in their lives and most of the time if they see something funny, they will be amused and want to see more of it. Content that includes value and humor will help you gain the respect of a larger audience. Then again, it depends on who your target audience is and what they like. Some audiences may not prefer humor and they just want you to bring them value. You have to identify what your audience wants and focus on user surveys that help you understand them better. Once you do that, you can deliver content that is tailored just for them. When you're building a strategy for your business, it's more important to engage with the audience to find out their needs. You'll win if you can understand the audience and what they want to achieve. - Sweta Patel, Silicon Valley Startup Marketing

We've seen video attract, by far, the most engagement over the past few years. Everyone's time and attention is fragmented these days; people would much rather watch a three-minute video than read text-heavy stories. The great thing about the video is that you don't have to have a degree in media production to create a good clip. If you're just starting out, try filming a few videos on your iPhone and post them to social media -- the more honest and authentic, the better. Earlier this year, I posted a video to LinkedIn about how excited I was about a new product our company was launching, and within minutes I had tens of thousands of views and hundreds of comments. - Yaniv Masjedi, Nextiva",
"Warren Buffett, one of the wealthiest and most successful investors in the world, recently shared some excellent advice for those who are looking to improve their value in the work world.

Michael Hood, co-founder of Toronto startup Voiceflow, recently accompanied Buffett to the Canadian Walk of Fame inductee gala. Hood took advantage of the opportunity to ask Buffett what advice he'd give to new graduates about to enter the workplace, so he could post the answer on LinkedIn.

The one easy way to become worth 50 percent more than you are now at least is to hone your communication skills--both written and verbal. If you can't communicate, it's like winking at a girl in the dark--nothing happens. You can have all the brainpower in the world but you have to be able to transmit it. And the transmission is communication.

Buffett's advice is so on point, especially considering that we live in a time when communication skills are more important than ever. Remote workers live and operate in different time zones and on different schedules, increasing the need to communicate effectively via the written word. Additionally, if you use modern technology to communicate, your potential audience has transformed from a few people to a few thousand, or a few million. Poor communication skills will affect how that audience perceives not only your message but you as well.

To accomplish this, resist the urge to interrupt, or to dismiss new ideas or techniques. Instead, dignify those you work with by asking for their opinions and perspectives. Then, make sure you pay attention when they speak--rather than concentrate on what you're going to say next.

By showing your audience that you value what they have to say, they'll be more willing to share what they really think.

2. Remember, it's not just what you say; it's how you say it.

Many people feel that respect must be earned, rather than given. But taking the initiative to show respect to others will drastically increase the power of your message.

Respect begets respect. If you show consideration and dignity in the way you speak to others, they'll be more willing to listen to what you have to say.

3. Think before you speak (or write).

In a world ruled by convenience and speed, it takes major self-discipline to think before speaking. But responding too quickly can cause you to say something out of emotion that you later regret--like sending an angry email or text, or agreeing to something that you don't really want to follow-through on.

Instead of responding immediately to every question or message, take time to think about your response. When speaking, this may be a matter of just a few seconds. When writing, it may be a few hours, or even a day.

Speaking face-to-face (or over the phone) is often preferable to written communication, because you can include emotional cues such as tone of voice, facial expressions, and gestures. You can also ask follow-up questions to make sure the other party understands and is on the same page.",
"According to one study, business leaders waste approximately 21.8 hours per week on low importance tasks or unproductive activities. Time’s a-wastin' in small businesses across the nation … is it wasting in yours?

Most likely, yes. As a small business owner, you’re weighed down by time wasters during the course of a normal day. You may spend time at work doing tedious tasks, taking breaks to recharge, and dealing with preventable business emergencies.

If you spend too much energy on time wasters, you may end up putting your small business’s growth on the back burner. Don’t let your company’s wellbeing take the hit—eliminate time wasters instead.

A time waster is something you unnecessarily spend time doing. Often, time wasters are activities that don’t produce benefits (e.g., texting). Time wasters can also be tedious tasks that have less time-consuming alternatives (e.g., running payroll by hand).

Here are a few common time wasters in business:

The power to connect with loved ones at any point in the day is a wonderful thing—except when it’s not. Frequently texting throughout the day can end up becoming a major time waster.

Do you use the internet to do your job? Odds are, you will need to access the internet at some point. And when you do, it can be easy to get off track. Surfing the internet for things that aren’t work-related can become dangerous. At first, a minute goes by ... then 20 minutes ... then an hour.

Chatting at the water cooler is a great way to catch up with your employees, but time can start adding up. And when conversations turn into gossip fests, it’s your cue to get back to work.

Many small business owners spend a significant portion of time manually handling business tasks they could either automate or outsource. Although absolutely essential, activities like small business bookkeeping and running payroll can become time-consuming without the right tools.

Reading through unimportant emails can be time wasters, especially if you receive hundreds per day. Business leaders spend 3.4 hours per week reading through emails that don’t add value to their business.

Having inefficient meetings can also take its toll on your small business. Unstructured meetings can quickly waste time, especially if you and employees get off topic. On average, leaders waste one hour per week in unproductive meetings.

My door is always open to my coworkers when they have questions, comments, or concerns. But if they came in every other minute with questions about how to do their jobs, we’d have a problem. Fielding employee questions can quickly become a time waster if your employees don’t have authority over their jobs.

You likely can’t completely wipe time wasters from your small business. Here are a few of the ways you can stop time wasters from wreaking havoc on your productivity, energy, and business.

Technology can be a beautiful thing. When you take advantage of technological tools, you don’t need to do everything by hand. Use technology to streamline tedious tasks and other small business owner responsibilities.

Are you wasting time managing tasks that technology can handle? Consider automating responsibilities like payroll, accounting, and marketing.

Payroll and accounting are time-consuming tasks that can take you away from profit-generating activities. With payroll and accounting software, you can get back to running your business.

Marketing is a critical part of attracting and retaining customers, but it can be a time waster if not done effectively. When you use marketing tools to automate email marketing and social media posting, you can cut time and more effectively market to your target audience.

Are you spending too much time on tiny tasks that pull you away from the big picture of your business? It’s hard letting go of aspects of your business. But if you have employees, you need to. Delegate daily operations to employees so you can focus on growing your business.

At my company, Patriot Software, every one of my employees has a critical role in operations. I’m not saying that their responsibilities are time wasters. But if I were to try to take on someone else’s role, I’d be wasting my time.

Don’t be afraid to delegate to employees. They are in the trenches day-in and day-out, so they know what needs done and how to do it effectively, without wasting time. And, avoid micromanaging your employees. Micromanaging is a huge time suck, and you have better things to do than peer over each worker’s shoulder.

Jumping between thoughts or projects can be a time waster. You might think that multitasking will save time, but more often than not it ends up wasting time, depending on the tasks.

One study found that people who constantly switch from task to task can lose up to 40% of their productivity. I don’t know about you, but I can’t afford to lose that much of my productivity.

So, why is multitasking bad? When you switch between tasks, you need to adapt your brain. While your brain is working on keeping up with the new task you’ve put in front of it, it’s trying to regain focus. And if you’re not focused, you likely work slowly and make mistakes.

Picture this: You’re writing an email to your vendor, John, when you take a call from an important investor, Shelly. “Hi John, thanks for getting back—” Oops. Don’t call Shelly John. Don’t multitask.

Instead of multitasking, focus on the task at hand. You’ll finish what you’re doing more quickly if you can concentrate on your current project before moving on to another.

How much time do you spend looking for records or sorting through inventory? Do you have piles of papers spread out on your desk? Do you have inventory spread out throughout your business? Not having an organized system in place is a business time waster.

Instead of weeding through clutter when you need to access documents, use an organized system. You can upload records to your computer to avoid misplacing them. When storing physical paper copies, use a secure filing cabinet that only you have access to.

Keep your inventory organized, too. Inventory management problems can come up when you don’t know where your inventory is or how much you have. Designate separate areas to inventory and track it as it goes through the production process. For example, you might keep raw materials in a storage room, goods in the production process in a back room, and finished goods on display.

Disorganization might not cost you large chunks of time at once. But after a few weeks of sorting through the same mess for a few minutes each day, time will start adding up.

How many meetings do you have per month? Although meetings aren’t inherently bad, you need to know how to make meetings more effective. Structure meetings to avoid wasting time.

To make meetings more effective, don’t host an official meeting each time you have an announcement. First, decide whether you even need to have a meeting. If you do need to have the meeting, create a plan for what you’re going to talk about.

Ask employees to prepare items they want to talk about. When employees are prepared and involved in the meeting, you can reduce the chances of them zoning out and not adding to the conversation.

You should also set a timeframe when hosting a structured meeting. That way, you won’t spend too much time on certain topics or get off track.

Structuring meetings can reduce the amount of times you need to meet per month, shorten meeting sessions, and improve takeaways.

When you run a business, distractions are constant. And, many distractions are out of your control. But if you can eliminate the distractions that you can control, you can save some time.

Consider eliminating distractions like cell phone usage, internet surfing, and excessive chatting about non-work topics.

You can reduce distractions like employee questions about low-priority tasks by giving employees authority over their jobs and resisting micromanaging.",
"You've more than likely heard that we are all creatures of habit. Whether we like it or not, many of our behaviors are habits that take up much of our daily lives. Some habits are healthy, and some, not so healthy. We're on autopilot, doing the same thing day after day, week after week, month after month, and year after year.

Just like individuals, organizations fall into habits too, and this can put your organization into a rut without you even knowing it. Have you thought about whether or not your organization is on autopilot?

In my work as a strategic advisor and coach, I ask my clients a simple string of questions to shine a light on their highest capabilities. The first is: if you were to sell your company today, would you be selling it at its highest potential? Rarely does a CEO or business owner answer yes. Most would say that they are not where they would like to be today. How would you answer?

That brings me to the next question: Why don't you feel you are at your highest potential? Generally, my clients will outline a few details related to growth, execution and/or profitability. If you agree that you're not at your highest potential, list out the top three reasons.

The third question I ask begins the process of creating what I call ""healthy disruption."" What are the barriers getting in the way of you reaching your highest potential? Make a detailed list right now.

Though you might have the tendency to try to solve these issues right now, wait. It's important to take your leaders through this same process. I encourage my clients to organize long lunch sessions (two hours each) over two consecutive days. Generally, this works best with an outside facilitator, but it will work well if you, yourself, take your CEO/leader hat off and become a facilitator.

What's most important is that the participants feel like they're in a safe environment to share. There needs to be a strong level of trust. If you have this kind of trusting environment, then you will see healthy disruption begin to develop.

Begin the first session whiteboarding the three questions: (1) If we were to sell our company today, would we be selling at our highest potential? (2) Why do we believe we are not at our highest potential? (3) What are the barriers getting in the way of us reaching our highest potential?

In the first session, you should avoid trying to solve the problem or eliminating the barriers that exist. This session should be focused on simply identifying the barriers and hard facts.

The second session is for narrowing the whiteboard down to the top three barriers or facts. Again, it’s not about solving the problem, but getting clarity and alignment on the top three things preventing you from reaching your highest potential.

It's unfortunate that in our daily work as owners and CEOs, we don't create an environment that allows for these facts to surface. CEOs will tell me that they are in constant communication with their team, but what they don't understand is that they are generally hearing the things that they want to hear from their direct reports and not the hard facts.

While your organization may be on a path of ""doing better than last year,"" you still may be in a rut. Think about ways to create a healthy disruption with your organizational leaders that can move you to a better path.",
"High levels of employee engagement can have an extremely positive impact on a work environment. Productivity rises, communication flows more openly and projects move from idea to actuation faster. However, whether from dissatisfaction with work or disruptive events in their personal lives, employees occasionally become disengaged. This can not only have negative effects on their work, but can also spread to other team members.

It’s important to recognize the signs of employee disengagement as early as possible so that effective action can reverse the trend. Below, 12 members of Forbes Human Resources Council share the signs of disengagement team leaders and HR need to watch for, as well as some tips on how to respond.

Employees who are disengaged will withdraw from any non-necessary conversations or activities. They also tend to only do the minimum to get by, will decrease their productivity and no longer give discretionary effort. HR can meet with disengaged employees to attempt to find out why this is occurring and, if needed, coach leaders about how to increase employee engagement. - Kellie Graham, SHRM-SCP, SPHR

Observable signs of disengagement include lack of participation in team or one-on-one meetings or in “the meeting after the meeting,” where employees meet separately to process and communicate what should have been shared in team meetings. Another sign is decreased productivity. Regular pulse surveys provide insightful data that can be used to proactively address concerns with managers and individuals. - Jeff Weber, Instructure

Engaged employees are reliable, with recognizable routines. When patterns change — a vocal person in meetings is now quiet, or a star performer’s deadlines slip — it’s worth taking a closer look. While it may be a stretch, one boss of mine believed a dramatic hairstyle change was concerning. When someone exhibits change, it’s time to inspect and open up a dialogue for explanatory insight. - Stacey Browning, Paycor

One prominent sign of disengagement is silence — on team calls, over email or in missed meetings altogether. If an employee seems distant, take immediate steps to connect with them one-on-one. Make yourself available to chat. Find out what drives them and coach them toward their goals. Encourage team members to also reach out and provide support. Hold a team lunch or fun outing to build relationships. - Vivian Maza, Ultimate Software

Almost every time I’ve seen apathy or lack of commitment from an employee, it’s been a clear sign they’re disengaged and likely looking to leave. Observable signs of apathy could be unwillingness to engage in healthy debate, just not caring enough to present or defend their ideas, not fulfilling their commitments (doing what they said they would do), and not being willing to be accountable. - Zach Montroy, SPHR, Navigate the Journey

Because there are many reasons why employees can be gone from work, we don’t often look at absenteeism as a sign of disengagement. The truth is, really engaged employees will find a way to be at work. Organizations should look at absenteeism as an opportunity to have a caring dialogue and ask, “What’s going on?” Maybe it is just a cold, or maybe there is something more.  - Lucy Rivas-Enriquez, Union Rescue Mission - Los Angeles

A clear sign of employee disengagement is complacency. Managers and employees need to have two-way, honest dialogues about performance, expectations and overall attitude before full disengagement ever becomes an issue. There are a number of factors for feeling complacent, but through honest discussions, great leaders can help discover the root cause and come up with a realistic solution. - Beth Ann Steinberg, Zenefits

Two of the most obvious signs of disengagement are a decline in work quality or output and regularly showing up late or missing deadlines. When these become persistent, HR should approach the employee as soon as possible to determine the causes. If it’s the result of disengagement, management should work with him or her to determine what is necessary for re-engagement. - John Feldmann, Insperity

Disengagement can stem from prolonged burnout, which manifests as exhaustion, cynicism and inefficiency. These employees might have been highly engaged at one point but didn’t have the tools to preserve their well-being. Explain how well-being can impact their ability to recover from their burnout. Encourage managers to adjust workloads when someone has been going full throttle for too long. - Laura Hamill, Limeade

Disengagement can show up as disinterest in participating. Leaders can respond by ensuring employees have a reason to, and know how to, engage. Leaders can co-create goals that are meaningful, measurable and achievable, but with some degree of difficulty, and can clarify connections of goals to the success of the company. Leaders can share role models of expected behavior and celebrate success. - Phyllis Wright, Ph.D., VRM Mortgage Services

One telltale sign is that an employee becomes disenchanted with the organization and acts out that disenchantment by frequently naysaying new ideas and opportunities related to driving the business forward. At the first sign of an issue, the manager should involve HR to help discover the root cause and work to correct the course of relations. - Scott Faurot, ashcompanies.com

Everyone has trying days, but to become curt with other coworkers or clients can be a big sign. It could actually be boredom or that an employee is not feeling heard, which may cause little effort in the workplace. Try holding a meeting and letting them speak frankly. From those meetings, conclusions could be mentorship opportunities, ongoing training or special project work they are interested in. - Elizabeth Coakley, C.H. Coakley & Company",
"I'd rather not calculate the hours -- probably days --that I've lost simply by staring at a blank screen, not knowing what I should write about or how I should even begin. Imagine the tens of thousands of additional words I could have produced during that time!

One incredibly simple and powerful method for breaking through this paralyzing feeling is freewriting. In his book, Writing With Power: Techniques for Mastering the Writing Process, Peter Elbow, a professor emeritus at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, spends an entire chapter on it.

Here's how he describes the process: ""To do a freewriting exercise, simply force yourself to write without stopping for ten minutes. Sometimes you will produce good writing, but that's not the goal...If you can't think of anything to write, write about how that feels or repeat over and over 'I have nothing to write' or 'Nonsense' or 'No.' If you get stuck in the middle of a sentence or thought, just repeat the last word or phrase till something comes along. The only point is to keep writing.""

Ever since I can remember, and even to this day, I've been a meticulous writer. That's my humble-brag euphemism for saying I'm a slow writer. I'm slow because I sweat every word in every sentence, rearranging in my head, trying out different permutations, before typing it out -- only to go back and rewrite again, and again, and again, and again. Freewriting, as Elbow claims, can help you break out of this time-sucking process:

""So much writing time and energy is spent not writing: wondering, worrying, crossing out, having second, third, and fourth thoughts...Frequent freewriting exercises help you learn simply to get on with it and not be held back by worries about whether these words are good words or the right words.""

2. Freewriting helps you learn to write when you don't feel like writing.

From my numerous conversations with writers on my podcast, and having read dozens of books on the craft of writing, it's hard not to conclude that learning to be a productive writer, and also a good writer, is the result of cultivating the habit of writing. It's the constant struggle against the ""Resistance,"" as Steven Pressfield calls it in his classic book, The War of Art.

""It is practice in setting deadlines for yourself, taking charge of yourself, and learning gradually how to get that special energy that sometimes comes when you work fast under pressure,"" says Elbow.

3. Freewriting teaches you to write without thinking about writing.

Speaking and writing are deceptively similar exercises. Both involve the conversion of thoughts into words. But as Elbow describes it, they differ in at least one very important way, and it partly explains why writing is so hard.

""We can usually speak without thinking about speech --without thinking about how to form words in the mouth and pronounce them and the rules of syntax we unconsciously obey --and as a result we can give undivided attention to what we say. Not so writing.""

While you can still stumble and pause and get nervous when you speak, with writing, the process is a lot messier, more prone to error, and definitely more stressful.

4. Freewriting is a quick outlet for venting your feelings.

Writing can easily be seen as a cold, analytical process devoid of emotion. Unless it's a computer-driven AI generating the words, this is not the writing process I know. Writing is inextricably tied up with how you're feeling at the very moment you're doing it.

Elbow puts it this way: ""We have lots in our heads that makes it hard to think straight and write clearly: we are mad at someone, sad about something, depressed about everything. Perhaps even inconveniently happy...Freewriting is a quick outlet for these feelings so they don't get so much in your way when you are trying to write about something else.""

5. Freewriting helps you to think of topics to write about.

Stymied for topics to write about? I know I often am. Freewriting can help turn on the ideas spigot in your brain and get them flowing again. Says Elbow: ""Just keep writing, follow threads where they lead and you will get to ideas, experiences, or people that are just asking to be written about.""",None
"The traditional performance assessment process gets a bad rap for being too infrequent, filled with unhelpful feedback and focused too much on raises and bonuses. But that doesn't mean that we should scrap it all together. There is value in getting well rounded, ongoing feedback from the people who you spend most of your time with.

Rather than trying to re-invent the system in its entirety-- a large undertaking for any individual leader-- I recommend starting with yourself by conducting a reverse performance review instead.

What makes a reverse performance review? It's initiated by you and it asks for a range of feedback from your direct reports in order to build realistic progress plans that you actually report back in on.

Identify three to five people you interact with on a regular basis who would be willing and able to offer you ongoing, objective feedback. The wider the mix of peers, direct reports, stakeholders (and maybe even your boss), the better.

2. Ask the same three questions.

Sit down with each person individually for no more than 30 minutes and ask them the same three questions:

Why these three questions? They're open enough to produce valuable feedback without being so broad that they'll overwhelm. As you listen to the answers, be on the lookout for broad themes that emerge. The more frequently and consistently you get a piece of feedback, the stronger the imperative to act on it.

3. Commit to a course of action.

The great thing about a reverse performance review is that you get to decide what you want to work on. As you review the feedback you've received and the key themes across your discussions, know that you don't have to work on every single thing that emerges. It's important to take what's useful and to leave the rest.

In fact, I suggest taking away no more than two or three specific things you're going to work on over the next 90 days.

Make sure you've got a clearly defined end goal and an articulated success metric for each development point. Then share these with your support group and ask them to hold you accountable.

Every three months or so, book in a 15-minute session with each person and share what you've done since the last time you met, what went well, what you'd do differently and what you're going to do over the next three months.

You should use these sessions strictly for an update on your progress and to hold you accountable to the things you've decided to work on. Keep focused on the discussion and try not to let small talk and socializing creep in (you can always schedule those for a different time).

Rinse and repeat this process every six months and continue to work on no more than two or three key issues at any one time. You'll begin to see lasting behavioral changes in the way you lead that will have a significant impact on your team and your organization.",
"New hires are expensive. When you add up the costs of recruiting, interviewing, onboarding, training, and ongoing development, the cost can be staggeringly high. However, the price of keeping a bad hire can easily outweigh the cost of replacing them. A bad hire impacts much more than the financial bottom line.

Bad hires don’t intentionally show up to work differently than they interviewed. The job may not be what they were expecting, it could turn out to not be a good culture fit, or a hundred other reasons. The question you have to ask is if it's worth keeping the employee and investing in them in the hopes they’ll improve, or is it better to cut your losses and find a new candidate? Before you make a final decision, there are a few things to consider.

Try to repair the situation.

Start by examining exactly why the new hire isn’t working out, and search to find the source of the problem. Are they struggling to keep up with the workload? Not understanding their job responsibilities? Is it a poor culture fit? Is there tension between the new hire and their colleagues? A personality clash between them and their manager? There’s no right or wrong answer here, but often the root of the problem lies within one of these scenarios.

Once you’ve identified the issue, or at the very least it’s underlying cause, you need to take steps to try to repair it. Start by delivering constructive feedback that highlights the issues with the new hire. Explore other factors that could be causing a problem, because the issue is never 100% the new hire's fault. In cases of personality conflict, focusing solely on the new hire will only exacerbate the problem.

Prepare yourself for an uncomfortable conversation.

You have to address the issue head on, which means having a direct and typically uncomfortable conversation with the new hire. This is not the time to beat around the bush with them, you have to be direct in expressing your concerns. The good thing is, the new hire knows that there’s an issue. Unlike other performance management conversations that can come as a surprise to the employee, the new hire will know right away why you want to have a talk.

The important thing here is to make it a conversation. Involve the new hire in the discussion and get their feedback and opinions. You need to clearly explain why you’re having the conversation and the specific issues that have come up, but also get their feedback on what you’re saying. Chances are, they’ve already recognized these issues and will be appreciative of the opportunity to come up with solutions.

This conversation will help you gauge whether the new hire is willing to change or adapt. If they're open to your feedback and actively participate in the conversation, that's a sign that it's worth investing in them, at least in the short term. If they're closed off and resistant to what you're saying, that indicates that they aren't likely to change and you should start to seriously consider if it's worth investing in them further.

Identify the cost of keeping the employee versus letting them go.

A new hire is a costly investment, but keeping a bad employee can be even more expensive. The affect a bad hire can have on the company hits far more than the financial bottom line. They can negatively impact employee morale, productivity, and performance and in extreme cases, cause existing employees to start to look for other jobs. All of this can stem from one bad hire, which is why it’s so important to evaluate the true cost of keeping them.

When weighing your options, consider both the immediate costs and the long term costs. Focus on all of the factors, not just monetary. Consider the amount of time you would need to dedicate to resolving the issues at hand. Will dedicating that time and money to training the new hire in the hopes they'll improve be worth it, or is there a better use of those resources?

There's no easy decision here, unfortunately. Keep in mind that it truly can be more expensive to keep a bad hire than to let them go, no matter how much money you put into hiring them. In the long run, hiring another candidate who is a good fit will more than balance out the money you lost on the bad hire. Letting a new hire go isn’t an easy decision, but sometimes it’s the best one to make.",
"Not everything that Facebook has done lately is wrong. So, let's try to sort out the prudent from the feckless before we all jump on the ""kill Facebook"" bandwagon.

Organizations commission in-depth research on their competitors and perceived adversaries all the time: it's called due diligence. In fact, it could be argued that a company or non-profit is not doing their job if they don’t seek to understand deeply those who invest in them, comment on them, compliment them, and criticize them. That is simply looking for more information, motives, ulterior motives, and doing the proper due diligence that their stockholders and stakeholders would expect them to do. Good strategy would dictate that they can not be expected to fly blind in a firestorm, if they can help it.

On this level, there is absolutely nothing wrong -- in my opinion as someone who has been active in creating public strategies for private and public organizations for a long time -- with Facebook's commissioning ""oppo"" research into George Soros after he excoriated tech companies at Davos. You know what: every good professional would, or should have, done the same thing.

Great leaders want and need to understand the views of their organization from the outside in -- especially critical ones, or ones that have recently changed 180 degrees. We preach all the time to them -- ""don't drink your own Kool-Aid""; ""listen to your critics""; ""understand them, be able to pivot, and create strategies to mitigate their complaints."" This is simply great strategy.

The rub comes when an organization or leader takes that information and then acts upon it in a way that is less than wholesome or admirable. And THAT is where Facebook's strategies regarding Mr. Soros get dodgy. Any time you build an external strategy to fight back criticism, unfair or not, by publicly denigrating or destroying your critic, you are getting yourself into trouble. And even if that practice is now successful in political and global circles, it doesn't mean it will work in tech, or in the world of social media. Or should.

Most Facebook members expect a higher moral standard from the organization they trust to hold their life data. Flaunt that expectation at your own risk.

Information is power, now more than ever. But you can use that power for the public good -- and to help inform and elevate your strategies to new levels of effectiveness and trustworthiness. And to build the trustworthiness of your brand. Or, you can misuse that power -- to target, denigrate, muddy the conversation, lower the level of compassionate discourse, and sully your brand.

So, beware of the advisors you hire in a firestorm. Some politically partisan ones, such as opposition research firm The Definers, can lead you down the low road -- or they won't challenge your instincts when you want to explore the nether regions. Other advisors will help you seek win/win public strategies that may be challenging in the short-run, but prepare you to shine in the mid- to longer-run.

Ethical dilemmas and opportunities are everywhere, and the lines between right and wrong are increasingly fuzzy. Yet, I don't believe it has ever been more important to our public weal to insist upon the moral, ethical, and strategic high roads than now. The more others do not, the more we must do.

In an effort to understand the low road, Facebook may have taken it. And that is a stance that must be walked back thoroughly, and now. And they can do that.",
"The Rams were prepping for their game with the Lions when they produced a roar on Thursday night: Cowboys 13,  Saints 10.

Excuse Los Angeles for muttering something along the lines of ""how 'bout those Cowboys.'' With Dallas upsetting  New Orleans, the Rams gained a half-game on the NFC leaders without taking a snap.

The Rams  (10-1) can forge ahead of New Orleans (10-2) in the race for the NFC's top playoff seed by disposing of the lowly Lions (4-7) come Sunday. After an assembly-like performance in the season's first three months, LA heads to Ford Field hoping its production remains steady as it goes.

With a win, the Rams will clinch their second-straight NFC West title.

Following the Rams' electric 54-51 win over the Kansas City Chiefs when they were last issued pads on Nov. 19, LA finally exhaled. The dramatic nature of that victory, and the team being affected by the pair of tragedies in its region, the squad, at last, pumped the brakes.

There's never a bad time for a bye in NFL and every one of its coaches will second that thought. But the Rams' respite was at an opportune time; eleven straight weeks is a challenge.

""Just based on the physicality of the game, our guys were ready for a little bit of rest and recover,'' coach Sean McVay said.

Aqib Talib took advantage of the schedule. He's scooting around the practice field again and it appears the cornerback will return for the Lions date after injuring his ankle on Sept. 23.

Talib will aid a secondary still licking its wounds from the Chiefs' onslaught.  His presence is needed and him paired with Marcus Peters, another Pro Bowler, was what the Rams envisioned with their offseason acquisitions. Peters' play has been on and off, but it's on an upswing and it gets another lift with Talib on board.

The big board shows the Rams ranked No. 19th in stopping the pass (252.6 yards per game). They hope Talib, an 11-year pro, supplies a spark down the stretch.

Todd Gurley is full steam ahead and there are few things more critical for the Rams. A tweaked ankle that diminished the running back's contributions in the win over the Chiefs is sturdy. In fact, Gurley said it never bothered him.

The Lions need not be a team the Rams fret over, especially considering they blew out the Giants after last year's bye. But the defense, which surrendered more than 500 yards versus the Chiefs, needs to rebound. If it does, the Rams are likely bound for the postseason.

""We'll talk about all those other things later,'' defensive coordinator Wade Phillips said. ""It's not crank it up for anything except this game.''",
"If you're a traffic cop in Silicon Valley, you're probably accustomed to seeing all sorts of surprising things. So it wasn't a huge shock when officers in Redwood City saw a Tesla Model S zooming south on U.S. 101 at 70 miles an hour around 3:30 am on Friday. Still, they thought something was off when they saw a man behind the wheel who appeared to be fast asleep. He turned out to be Alexander Joseph Samek, planning commissioner of Los Altos and a hotel industry financier, developer, and entrepreneur.

The officers first drove alongside the Tesla and confirmed that Samek appeared to be sleeping. They got behind the car and turned on their flashing lights, indicating he should pull over, but that failed to wake him. So the quick-thinking cops, concluding that the Tesla might be in Autopilot mode and programmed not to collide with another vehicle, pulled ahead of the Tesla, got in front of it, and gradually slowed down. The Tesla slowed in response, and they were eventually able to bring it to a complete stop.

The officers then approached the car and woke Samek by knocking on the window and calling to him, which worked after a while. They gave him a field sobriety test and then arrested him on suspicion of DUI.

This is at least the second time a Tesla has been stopped in the region with an impaired driver behind the wheel. In January, a Tesla was found driving in Autopilot with a driver whose blood alcohol was twice the legal limit. He, too, was arrested and the Tesla was impounded. ""(No it didn't drive itself to the tow yard,)"" California Highway Patrol tweeted at the time.

Many experts have argued that a well-functioning, fully autonomous car would likely be safer than a human driver. It seems certain that an autonomous car is a safer driver than a human who has been drinking or is otherwise impaired. It also seems certain that at some point in the future, self-driving cars will be a useful alternative for people who are inebriated or exhausted or can't drive due to a disability.

But that future is not here yet. Autopilot is not intended to turn a Tesla into a fully autonomous car, and the company has always told drivers that they should continue watching the road and take control of the wheel regularly. After the first Autopilot fatality, in the spring of 2016, Tesla pushed out software to its cars that gives more frequent warnings to drivers who don't put their hands on the wheel for extended periods, and will stop working after three warnings until the driver stops and restarts the car. Nevertheless, a second fatal Autopilot crash happened this spring when a Tesla Model X swerved out of its lane and into a highway divider. And last January, a Tesla in Autopilot mode was also involved in a fatal crash in China.

In other words, if you're under the influence or too sleepy to drive, you're better off calling for a ride or using a designated driver than relying on Autopilot to get you home. And if you're an autonomous driving engineer, you should probably consider teaching your car to recognize flashing lights and pull over in response.",
"Congratulations! You've just been promoted to a big job, heading a group or function. You got the job because you're smart and hard-working--so hard-working, in fact, that your colleagues wonder if you ever sleep.

Naturally, you want to communicate with your team. Share your vision for what the group needs to accomplish. Do some straight talking about what needs improvement. Get everybody fired up, engaged, on board, on the same page.

And the good news is you can teach yourself to be a better listener. Here are five ways to do so:

1. Get up and go. If you're like most people, your office space is a breeding ground for distractions. Email, ringing phones, smartphones and paperwork are like Kryptonite that can drain your power to listen.

The next time you need to have an important conversation with a colleague, leave your office and meet in a location that's free from distractions. Find a place that enables you to focus all of your energy and attention on the speaker. Try a local park, a quiet mall at non-peak hours or a restaurant.

3. Wait your turn. If you're the type of person who has the tendency to interrupt the speaker before he or she finishes, you're not alone. One way to improve is by counting to three after the speaker finishes talking before you respond. The more you practice this exercise, the easier it'll be to wait your turn to speak.

4.  Demonstrate understanding and appreciation. Nothing is more frustrating than trying to talk with someone when all he or she does is give you blank stares in return. One of the keys of effective listening is acknowledging what the speaker says. Here are a few ways you can demonstrate understanding and appreciation for the speaker:

5. Ask questions. One of the best ways to improve your listening skills is by asking more questions. Your question can be as simple as ""How are things going?"" or ""How's your job been lately?"" In addition, ask your colleagues to speak up when they have issues or concerns and tell them that you'll always be available to listen to them and provide support.

Remember, of course, that listening takes work . . . you have to want to hear what your team members have to say.",
"China is experiencing its slowest growth since 2009, but that doesn’t mean it’s getting any easier for multinationals to hire and retain Chinese employees in top cities like Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen.

“I thought the slowdown and gloomier prospects, caused by the trade war, would dramatically cut down on job hopping – but it hasn’t,” says one Western executive in Shanghai.

Surveys bear this out. Bilateral relations, domestic competition and cutting through red tape have emerged as the main challenges for U.S. multinationals, but human resources remains key to operational success. Moreover, Western firms are no longer the default employer of choice for young white collar Chinese : fast-growing private Chinese companies, state-backed firms, and entrepreneurs now compete for the best local talent.

Many multinational leaders complain about the talent situation, and the sharpest are taking strategic and creative measures to attract, retain, and motivate their workforces.

These forward-looking companies do three things particularly well: they discover what motivates their Chinese employees, they tailor their people policies accordingly, and when possible, they test and measure. This process has made their human resources strategy a source of competitive advantage and is improving the bottom line.

Here’s a deeper look at what companies are doing:

Life Solutions delivers five-star service to clients in the recommendation, installation and maintenance of state-of-the-art drinking water systems. To deliver its service, the company requires top sales, engineering and support staff – positions with technical and soft skills that are in high demand in China.

Most of its employees do not come from Shanghai, where the company’s sales and services head office is based, which means staff highly value staying connected to their parents and relatives and see their company as a tightly knit family.

Jon Newton, cofounder and managing director, has paid close attention to this cultural context. He spends considerable time in the field with his employees and customers and has built a highly local team of managers whose opinions he trusts.

To motivate the team, Life Solutions could have taken the conventional approach and focused solely on cash rewards. Instead, it did two things. Firstly, it sent annual gifts – food and other important goods – back to employees’ parents. Secondly, it gave the team alternatives to cash payouts: employees opted to allocate some of those funds to freshly cooked meals at lunch time so everyone could eat together and they voted for weekend getaways for the team.

“I’ve worked around the world and human motivation is more or less the same – but the specific measures to take, however, can vary by culture,” says Newton, who grew up in South Africa but has started and run multiple businesses in China for nearly 20 years.

The insight: discover the role culture plays in motivating employees, like Life Solutions has.

Based on the insight that employees wanted to feel part of a caring family, Life Solutions strategically tailored its rewards and incentives.

But in today’s rapidly changing China, what worked for Life Solutions may not work for everyone.

Take the example of a fast-growing U.S. technology multinational. Its sales staff is primarily made up of young, single men in their mid and late twenties. In China, young men face mounting pressure to buy a house in preparation for marriage and to show upward mobility in their jobs.

Based on this observation, the company created large cash bonuses, contingent upon hitting aggressive targets. It coupled the rewards with multiple promotion tiers and pay grades: more than twice the number of job levels offered in the company in the United States and Europe. For these young men, making substantial money and getting recognized was paramount.

However, engagement surveys revealed a different dynamic for the company’s customer support and technical staff, the majority of whom were young women. The staff, mostly in their late twenties, had one overriding concern: getting married, lest they become “sheng nu,” a Chinese expression meaning “leftover women”. The company didn’t want to play matchmaker, so instead it created more flexible working schedules and even set up after-work social mixers with other companies in its office park.

The insight: people policies can and should vary, and in China, be aware of powerful social pressures on employees.

Marketers know the best research is a live A/B test with a control group, and human resource departments have caught on.

Ctrip, a leading online travel services provider, has long set itself apart by its data-driven approach to business success. In an oft-cited study with Stanford University, the company ran a nine-month test to understand the impact of telecommuting on work productivity. Results showed that in comparison to employees who came into the office, at-home workers were happier, less likely to quit and were more productive. The numbers were striking: remote workers completed 13.5% more calls and quit at half the rate of people working in the office. The company also saved $1,900 per employee over the nine months in furniture and office space.

Remote working particularly appeals to working mothers, who comprise a large percentage of the company’s workforce. Ctrip operates in a highly competitive tech industry, and has put policies to attract female talent at the forefront of its strategy. As the CEO, Jane Sun, has stated: “It shouldn’t be a choice of ‘work or family,’ but ‘work with family.’”

Not every company can conduct disciplined large-scale tests, and so care must be taken in drawing conclusions, but experimentation can still pay off.

For example, one small biotech firm in Shanghai, hearing feedback that employees wanted annual gym memberships, provided the option of fitness trackers. The devices, which cost a fraction of monthly gym fees, alerted office workers to take regular breaks, while the gamified aspect led to healthy competition about who walked the most each week. The company saved money (employees who opted for gym memberships dramatically dropped off going to the gym after three months) and addressed the underlying need to stay fit.

The insight: Test or experiment when possible. Smaller companies can look to solid research like that of Ctrip and Stanford, or at evidenced-based studies on what drives worker engagement and productivity, allowing them to decide how they can best be applied in China’s cultural context.

Chinese and Western leaders in China agree that employee motivation techniques have evolved rapidly: China’s white collar workforce is now well compensated and most employees - after they reach a competitive base salary - look beyond money. Many Chinese now seek personal and professional career growth, autonomy and being part of something bigger. These drivers of employee motivation are surprisingly universal, making it clear that the secret in China may actually not be so secret.

The companies mentioned above are showing what works in China, discovering what motivates and engages employees and tailoring or testing their policies accordingly. While the importance of other challenges may rise and fall on annual business surveys, getting the people equation right will remain critical to staying ahead in China’s fast-moving, competitive environment.",
"My firm interviews thousands of candidates weekly and we hear the top reasons candidates are looking to leave their current employer. Relationship with their manager is among the most repetitive reasons.

Just like any relationship, trust is at the core of a successful one...and that takes time to build. It doesn't happen overnight. It's an investment, but in today's economy where employees have options, it's a worth-while investment.

Companies spend dollars on flashy perks like foosball tables, game rooms, unlimited beer and snacks. What they don't always do is invest time, which does equate to money, and is something employees are seeking, something that makes a genuine impact, something they may not be able to get elsewhere.

It takes time to build a solid foundation, and once you have it, you have to keep building on it. Relationships are an emotional bank account you keep depositing into, and if you make one bad transaction, that account can empty very instantaneously.

Building trust means leaders keep their word and doing things they say they'll do...and it starts with the little things. If a manager says they will help an employee with something, or schedule a meeting, they do it, they show up. Or they do something to help the employee without being asked to. It's managers recognizing employees publicly and giving them credit when due. It also means letting the light shine on their employee, even if the work was shared. Building someone up is the job of a manager. It doesn't mean you don't hold them accountable, it simply means you have EQ and know when people need a confidence boost.

Trust happens when leaders let their guard down and are vulnerable, both personally and professionally. You can't expect employees to be open and share if you don't. It's a two-way street... and it's not talking about the amazing two-week vacation you just went on, but the struggles you're facing, admitting to mistakes and asking for help when needed. They want to know their boss is human.

Start with the small things to show employees you care. Show them you're committed to their development. Employees need to know you have their back as a leader.  And most importantly, be consistent. Building trust isn't a one-week project.",
"Wouldn’t it be great to work for a boss who is competent, understanding, and supportive? Unfortunately, that’s not always reality. From my own corporate career as well as the experiences of my coaching clients, I know that having the perfect boss is nearly impossible. It's critical for your success to learn how to deal with the boss you have.  Sure, you can change jobs, and that might be necessary sometimes when the situation is so toxic that there’s no solution. But you never know what type of new boss you’ll get in your next job and company. The best first step is to try to understand your boss and learn how to deal with their personality. There’s no doubt. Sometimes our bosses we can be extremely difficult.

Early in my career, I had a male boss who was such a misogynist and bully that he intimidated me. I avoided him as much as possible. He didn’t bully me perse. But his personality was so strong and abrasive that I was silent in his presence. I didn’t seek him out and let him know what I was working on; what I achieved and how I did it. This avoidance did not serve me well. When a potential promotion was available in my territory, I had no relationship with him. He didn’t understand my value and I was overlooked for that job.

The lesson here for me is that no matter what your boss’s personality is, observe them, figure out their motivations, their triggers, and learn how to work with them in a way that benefits both of you.

I asked Vicky Oliver, author of Bad Bosses, Crazy Coworkers & Other Office Idiots, what are the worst types of bosses; the types that drive workers most crazy. Her answer was bullies, absentee bosses, and narcissists. She offers her best advice on how to deal with these different bosses.

The absentee boss. Often, the absentee boss can't help the fact that he or she is not around. Maybe there were cuts, so this type of boss is trying to manage several different offices, located a time zone or two apart. You need the boss's approval on a project, a green light to go forward. Problem is, you can't find him. You email... you leave voice messages. But the boss is on an airplane or on route to an airport. And there is not a system in place to handle this boss's absences.

Solution: If your boss is not available, sometimes you just need to go with your gut, and let good sense guide you. Think about what you believe your boss would do--and do it. Eventually, a decision maker, be it your boss or someone else in a position of authority, will get back to you with feedback. If your decisions were good, the feedback will be positive. But even negative feedback gives you a chance to grow and learn. Take heart that an absentee boss needs people under him or her who can make good decisions and add value. If you are doing this consistently, a promotion may lie in your future.

The bully. The bully has it in for you. He or she yells at you, dressing you down in front of other workers. Even passing by his office makes you cringe. The bullying may take place in person or via email. Either way, you hate working for this person and want to leave.

Solution: Do not lose your cool. Wait till the bullying episode has stopped. Never challenge a bully in the midst of his yelling tirade. Instead, wait for a quiet time a few days after the incident. Pass by his or her office. Knock on the door and ask if you can have a moment. Recount the episode. Tell your boss how you felt during that situation. Sometimes just being made aware of the behavior can help tone down a bully's ire. You can't cower. You need to let the person know that you feel bullied and belittled, and that you don't find it to be professional behavior. If the bullying took place in a group email, resist the temptation to fire back an immediate response. Cool down. Walk away from the screen. Write an email -- and save it in your drafts folder. Then, 24 hours later, rewrite the email to make it sound as neutral as possible. Defend yourself via email -- but strike a professional tone.

The narcissist. Narcissists charm their employees, initially seeming to care about their development. Gradually, though, as their underlings grow, the narcissist's true nature shows through. They seem to no longer value the employee's input. They say ""No,"" a lot, and now it seems they are holding the person back.

Solution: Try to be your own motivator. Focus on making a good impression on others. Maybe there's a lateral move you can make to another team or department before your boss completely turns on you. Give yourself extra assignments. Offer to pitch in a lot Maybe offer to help with social media for the whole company. Try to raise your profile so that others discover you. You will need to leave, so be diligent about planning your escape route.

At the end of the day, you can only control your own behavior. Despite how difficult your boss is, chances are they aren’t going to change. Over the course of your career, you will have many different bosses who present a variety of challenges. Learning to manage these different types of bosses, will help you develop your own leadership style and be successful in the long run.

"While there are still five weeks left in the NFL season, I know which team I’ll be cheering for come the playoffs: the one that just fired its star player.

On Friday, hours after a video of him assaulting a woman surfaced on the internet, the Kansas City Chiefs released star running back Kareem Hunt. Hunt, who was not only the team’s leading rusher but one of their most dynamic playmakers, will not receive any further compensation from the team. Personally, I love this move. Hunt needed to be released, not only for the alleged incident but for misleading the team with his statements. Whatever the legal severity of the crime, when Hunt chose to lie to his employer rather than own his mistake he created a culture of mistrust that, if unaddressed, would infect the Chief's locker room. The Chiefs said as much in their public statement when they released him after seeing the video for the first time.

“Earlier this year, we were made aware of an incident involving running back Kareem Hunt. At that time, the National Football League and law-enforcement initiated investigations into the issue. As part of our internal discussions with Kareem, several members of our management team spoke directly to him. Kareem was not truthful in those discussions. The video released today confirms that fact. We are releasing Kareem immediately.”

While some on the internet have immediately drawn comparisons to the Ray Rice incident a few years ago, there’s a more recent example that we can turn to: the San Francisco 49ers and Reuben Foster. Foster, the talented linebacker from the University of Alabama with a troubled past, was finally released by the 49ers earlier this month after yet another accusation of domestic violence. San Francisco GM John Lynch said the team had done their best to work with Foster, giving him second and third chances to change his behavior. It finally became clear he wouldn’t. The 49ers released Foster last week—and the Washington Redskins immediately claimed him off the waiver wire. They were the only team to submit a claim.

That’s the way it goes in some organizations: talent trumps character. It’s a mercenary approach that only encourages further mercenary behavior. Leaders of organizations with a mercenary culture tend to have turbulent—and short—shelf-lives. That’s why I love Kansas City’s direct and immediate reaction Friday. While some might argue that the Chiefs should’ve cut Hunt the moment the incident happened, the Chiefs did the right thing by pulling Hunt in for a talk to hear his side of the story, then allowing the legal system to go to work. No charges ultimately were filed, but when the video surfaced and it became clear that Hunt had lied to the team about the incident, they didn’t hesitate.

They put one of their most talented players out on his butt. And Hunt agreed the team had made the right decision.

Speaking to the Lisa Salters on NFL Countdown this weekend, Hunt said, “The Chiefs are right and I didn’t tell them everything. I don’t blame them for everything. My actions caused this. I really wish I could just apologize to them … I love the program, love the people there. I just want to take this time and better myself and not let anything happen like this ever again."" Is Hunt really sorry for his actions? Will he really better himself? Will he get the chance to play in the NFL again? Those are questions to which we won’t know the answer for a while. But the one question we indisputably know the answer to is How do the Kansas City Chiefs handle star players who behave badly? By making this choice, they have sent a loud message to the other players on the roster. And that answer is why I’ll be pulling for the Chiefs come January.",None
"We all know the phrase ‘fail-fast’, the mantra associated with many a start-up, but for many businesses, failing is still exactly that, a failure.

When a new idea or project goes sour, those goals aren’t met, or new business visions and hopes aren’t realised; it’s the elephant in the room. Most people want to ignore that it ever happened, hoping that it will go away and be forgotten, but we shouldn’t.

Rather than trying to brush over mistakes or ignoring something when it goes wrong, companies should look to not only accept it, but open up and embrace failure.

From our school days, with tests and exams, a fear of failure can be deeply instilled, with a sense of black and white between failure and success. The problem with this, though, is that no business, career or indeed, even our time at school, will run smoothly. Making mistakes is par for the course for any business and any one – even the likes of Netflix and Amazon can testify to that – and ultimately it is those mistakes that lay the foundations for long-term success.

Despite this, many of us continue to cling on to that belief that no successful business or employee makes mistakes – and that’s not only the case for new beginners and young joiners fresh out of university, but this mindset can be held by anyone across a business, even those near the end of their career. No matter your seniority or experience, if there’s no visibility around the notion of failure, then it’s hard to shift that perception.

So, be transparent. It’s time to switch up your employees’ thinking, re-wiring those school day teachings to focus on the benefits a bumpy journey can bring. This is where managers and senior leaders can play a key role in helping change attitudes, sharing their own blunders and mishaps they faced on the way to where they are now – and just because you’re in a senior role doesn’t mean you’re immune to mistakes either. The difference though is how you deal with it afterwards, and that’s the point to be made.

If employees think that your workplace shuns failure, then it is likely to lead to more mistakes. Employees who realise that there is a problem will not flag it to others but keep quiet, perhaps even try to cover it up. But this doesn’t make the problem go away, if anything, this makes it worse. It allows for the issue to bubble away unnoticed, slowly snowballing until it could become a much bigger issue.

It could even be that other employees have had the same concerns but also felt too afraid to say anything. If people feel that they can open up about mistakes then it can be addressed and resolved.

It’s true, though, no matter how much managers or senior leaders may say that they would rather hear about a problem than not or even after sharing their own concerns, we can still be reluctant to speak up, especially if that means owning up to making a mistake. It’s back to those school days again, when the teacher assures you that you won’t get into trouble and you have to put your hand up and own up to something in front of the whole class.

But it needn’t be a hand-raising exercise, you can create a safe space where employees feel that they can be honest, without any judgement from others. For those nervous to speak out, ensure that they can do also do so anonymously, if they wish. After all it is not about finger pointing, but uncovering an issue, addressing it and changing it for the better.

The realisation and discovery that something isn’t working can in fact be the key that unlocks a whole new approach, propelling a business in a whole new direction – one that could be the better path to reach those goals and successes.

A workplace that embraces failure is in the best position to cultivate a culture of learning and development, with employees confident to seek out and learn new skills, and perhaps more importantly, helping your business to innovate and move forward. If employees feel that they can be open and forthcoming about failure, then they will be more likely to take those risks, whether trying out new approaches or tools or simply suggesting that crazy idea that may just turn a failing project around.

Still, this new approach may still take a little encouragement. This could be something as small as adding an agenda point to meetings for “crazy new ideas” or “Someday, Maybe” opening it up to the floor, or at the Christmas party when you’re giving out prizes, why not have one for the person who’s tried out the most new ideas this year?

There is a difference between taking risks and being reckless. Risks can still be calculated and planned for. This is not about completely throwing caution to the wind but rather the aim here is to instil a culture of honesty, learning and experimentation. “Failure” is in fact a vital part of any company’s work culture and business success, it’s all about how you choose to embrace it.",
"Customer engagement sets leading companies apart from the rest of the pack. Reaching a client base, then keeping their attention, is often highly indicative of how well a company’s marketing and customer experience strategies are being utilized. That ability to keep attention and engagement is crucial to building an audience, growing sales and, eventually, building brand loyalty.

Yet what works for customer engagement varies, depending on companies and target audiences. And with so many different strategies to consider, it may not be readily apparent which are likely to be the most effective for your company’s business strategy needs. To help, nine members of Young Entrepreneur Council weigh in with their own methods for keeping customers engaged, and why they work so well. Here's what they said:

We're crazy about client satisfaction. We offer 100% money back guarantees, same-day responses, exchanging with individual contacts (phone numbers or email addresses), you name it. When our clients bring up an issue, we don't point them to four other articles or FAQs and say ""go figure it out."" We figure it out for them. - Keyvan Firouzi, Valuation Shop, Inc. (dba Preferred Return)

Identify what separates you from the rest of your market, or why a consumer should consider your product versus the same item up the street. Instead of demanding what you need, ask others involved what they may need from you. If you can satisfy consumers, in return you will have their trust in future endeavors. - Joseph Pace, J. Pace & Son Inc

An effective way to get clients or customers engaged with our service is by doing the work for them, and making the process extremely easy. We work with creators on a daily basis, and most drop-offs are due to not wanting to learn something new or because they don't have time. This strategy works really well because we eliminate the two biggest pain points for new customers. - Charles Koh, Pixery, Inc.

4. Put Yourself In The Customer’s Shoes

Customer empathy is our key to sales. We’ve found that the most helpful way to build products and sell them is to put ourselves in our customer's shoes, conduct interviews, learn about the challenges they face and make those solutions a reality. We can’t create customized solutions for everyone, but through this process, it’s very easy to identify things that many customers are struggling with. - Evan Hung, Nikola Power Corp.

When our customers get excited about our product and get a glimpse of something they want to build with it, we have an evangelist for life. Those evangelists are the best at getting others excited and invested and continue to pay it forward. - Stephanie Wells, Strategy11, LLC

We've always kept our customers engaged by providing content that they find valuable. We reach out to our customers via email, on our blogs, and on social media. We've found that the more we engage with them, the more engaged they are with us. - Blair Williams, Caseproof, LLC

We walk our clients through custom dashboards that we build to engage and educate them on what's happening, why and what decisions we can make from understanding the data. This allows the client to feel engaged as a partner instead of feeling like they are on the sidelines. - Ryan O'Connell, Boomn

Appreciation is a motivating expression within human behavior. Humans incessantly desire appreciation; therefore, customer appreciation events are invaluable to any business in their efforts to rally engagement. Customers vote with their dollar, so these types of events are the company's way of saying ""thank you for voting for us."" Customer appreciation creates a sense of community and loyalty. - Taylor Irwin, Rocky Mountain Car Wash

You need to demonstrate deep thought leadership before the customer buys from you for the first time — this builds trust and makes the customer cross the first barrier. Once the customer gets hooked, the only way to sustain this trust is through selfless customer service that treats both a $100 and $1 million customer with equal importance. - Subramanian Viswanathan, Disprz",
"New initiatives are a crucial facet of company growth and industry mobility. Launching new products or services helps a company expand its reach, striving to connect new ideas to new customers. But before reaching potential new clients, the company must first garner employee buy-in during the production and prelaunch phases. Employee excitement and buy-in is vital for engagement: Without it, all members of the company may not be on the same page, resulting in delays or even errors.

Yet, not all employee buy-in methods are created equal. So which methods of sparking excitement for a branding initiative or new project are the most effective, and why? Below, 10 members of Forbes Communications Council share their top strategies for connecting employees with new initiatives in ways which garner peak buy-in.

1. Make It Fun And Show Them Why It Matters

Employees appreciate feeling included and enjoy the engagement. Instead of making it feel like it is one more thing for them to have to do or care about, aim for two things: Make it fun for them, and show them why it matters and why their participation is important. When we needed an increase in Google reviews, we gave a presentation to the entire company about their importance. We ended the presentation by announcing an opportunity to win an Amazon gift card for every Google review they were able to obtain. Our Google score went from a 1 to 4.5 within months. - Rachel Verslues, Primaris Healthcare Business Solutions

2. Be Inclusive At An Early Stage

In order to get commitment from peers on a new project, I've found it important to be inclusive at an early stage — ask for other people’s opinion and input before the initiative is set in stone. It creates a win-win as it makes people feel their opinion matters, creates a better end product, and the more people that stand behind the project, the easier it will be to move it forward. - Iris Voltaire, Adore Me

As with anything, you need to start with vision and passion — both with developing it and then communicating it. If you can use these two tools correctly, you can mold perception around any idea or plan. If executed properly, that perception will become a reality. - Gyles Uhlenhopp, Black Hills IP

Like anything in life, people are motivated out of fear or passion. Fear is boring; we are constantly under threat of losing our jobs etc. True talent and greatness always reveal itself through the spirit of competition. The Olympics, the NBA finals, the Super Bowl and the heavyweight championship bout are all examples of places where true talent and dedication can be witnessed. Create a unique motivating proposition for your staff and let the cadence of competition take over. You might be very surprised. - Paul Faerstein, Ellington Media Corp.

5. Speak In The Context Of Their Perspective

Companies are not machines or monolithic structures; they are comprised of individuals. Rolling out new messaging or information requires reaching those individuals and speaking in the context of their perspective. Sales have a different perspective than that of customer service or finance. To be effective, one must communicate from the point of view of each individual, rather than use a one-size-fits-all approach. - Shreesha Ramdas, Strikedeck

Show them the money. Any major new marketing initiative should be the result of some interesting growth experiments. Show those results to co-workers and explain how it impacts their job in order to achieve buy-in. - Jon Falker, GLIDR

Seek their advice and share the presentation that outlines the initiative; talk them through it and have them contribute. I find that not only does this spark excitement, but it gives them the incentive to share on their own social channels once the campaign goes live. - Megan Pope, KEYPR

Don't wait until you have a new campaign to make your company a part of your brand. Some of the best story ideas come from unique corners of your company, so always leave the metaphorical door open. An open Google Form or stories from an email alias allow any team to drop in and share the kernel of an idea. It's your job as the expert to see what makes those stories unique and worth sharing — then work with people to build them out. - Amy Dunn, Bumped

9. Reach Out To The Entire Employee Base

The most effective internal evangelists are brave, in reaching out to the entire employee base, and authentic, in writing it themselves. It's a powerful feeling when you hit the ""send"" button to 150,000 employees, but you have to use that superpower effectively. The most important aspect is to avoid formatting and definitely don't call anything a ""newsletter."" Just include a fun picture of yourself and write in a similar manner as you would speak to them. You'll be amazed at how thirsty your team is for someone to step up and be the head cheerleader. - Paul Gottsegen, Mindtree

10. Explain How It Will Make Work Easier

The best way to spark excitement and buy-in from peers and employees is to frame an initiative in the context of how it will make someone's job, and by extension the company's mission, easier to achieve. If it's not clear to people how this is going to positively impact their day-to-day work and how that change will then, in turn, make a positive impact on the company's trajectory in the market, then you won't be able to rally people behind it. - Monika Saha, Delphix",
"As we head toward the holiday season, you're probably beginning to take inventory of the year coming to an end and building your plans for the 12 months ahead. How did this past year go for you? Did you meet your goals? Did you meet your own personal expectations? Any dynamic changes to your business environment, competitive set, staff or customer?

Part of planning for the future requires assessing the past. Recognize where things thrive and replicate them. At the same time, identify those key missteps from the past three quarters. Learn from them and ensure they will not be repeated.

As we spend this time of seasonal retrospect considering what lies ahead, we suggest that all Challenger Brands take a moment to be thankful for where you are at this specific moment in time. Here are a few ways to intentionally practice gratitude.

Know your 'why.'

What is your “why?” Why do you do what you do? Why are you in this business? Why do you push yourself to be successful? Why the long hours, the travel, the stress? Identify your “why” and own it. Respect, honor and remember your “why.”

Whether you do what you do for your family, employees, community or simply for yourself (and there’s nothing wrong with that!), regularly remind yourself of that unspoken mission and be grateful for what you’ve accomplished. Celebrate your victories, large and small, and remember why you are victorious.

Be grateful and share your gratitude. Let those around you know you are grateful. As human emotions go, it’s hard to beat gratitude for pure, genuine empathy between people. In fact, the practice of gratitude has dramatic, long-term effects.

In a study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology at UC Davis, researchers found that people were happier when they regularly tracked their gratitude. One easy way to do this is to keep a gratitude journal.

Go ahead and take this gratitude thing a step further. Engage your team in this line of thinking. Encourage members of your organization to share their “whys” with each other. Knowing what motivates your colleagues is a powerful piece of information that can be harnessed for both team motivation and business building.

Internal rewards and recognition can be constructed with an employee’s “why” in mind. This could even help drive your staff to be driven to achieve goals, knowing that their “why” will be fed as a result.

As an example, imagine that a sales leader on your team is a widely recognized, vocal and spirited alum of the local university. This staffer bleeds the school colors and lives and dies by the team’s wins and losses. What if part of this employee’s comp plan included a scholarship in his or her name for a deserving incoming freshman in a field appropriate to your industry? This salesperson’s success could be represented in the form of a personal legacy that may be even more meaningful than the same amount of bonus money given to the staffer in their paycheck.

Let’s use the holidays as a reminder to embrace our “why” and express gratitude for all that has driven us this year. Gratitude is contagious; feel free to spread it around.",
"Most of the entrepreneurs I advise today are ready to declare success when they get that first surge of traction with a real customer. This is a good sign, but they have no idea that the hard work of scaling the business is still ahead of them.

It's a bit like the heady first days after you've fallen in love, when you can't imagine anything will ever kill that passion or commitment.

Scaling a business is fraught with risk and unknowns. You need to find investors for funding, vendors for volume manufacturing, processes for repeatable execution, as well as marketing and distribution to attract customers far beyond your pilot rollout. In fact, this is where your startup has to move from an initial project to a complex product business.

Based on my software career with IBM and several startups, I experienced the challenges and failures of scaling a software project to a business many times.

I now realize that software has evolved to be key to the value of most products, including cars, airplanes, and appliances, as outlined in the new book, Project to Product, by Dr. Mik Kersten, currently CEO of Tasktop.

Dr. Kersten asserts, and I agree, that it doesn't work today to manage software as a cost center inside a business -- it is too integral to the value stream of the solution provided, most evident during scaling.

He outlines five dimensions of scaling any business that introduce new levels of complexity, requiring tools with an overall view of business flows, processes, and value delivered:

What may have looked like an incidental cost in your base product will now grow to be a major impact on profitability, customer responsiveness, and time-to-market.

For example, new car infotainment system options alone are fundamentally more complex in terms of features than entire software products were a few years ago, requiring millions of lines of code from multiple vendors, multiple languages, and UIs.

2. Evolving from an initial solution to a product line for growth.

This means more suppliers, more interfaces, and more integration to manage, which is today the realm of software.

BMW, for example, now has around 12,000 suppliers worldwide, for their many models, and each car now consists of over 30,000 parts. They produce a new car every seventy seconds, in the sequence of received customer orders. That's a huge scaling challenge.

3. Adding partners, with their own tools and specialists.

You can't manage partners in the same fashion as you manage your own internal teams and processes, so scaling the business through partners adds additional complexity.

Communication at the digital level has to be done through formal software interfaces (APIs) that you never anticipated.

The specialists to support these may speak different technical as well as communication languages, and be physically dispersed around the world.

If a business sells to both business-to-consumer and business-to-business, it will need two separate support channels connected to multiple value streams. The opportunities for disconnects and disruptions go up again as the business scales to this level.",None
"Clemson coach, Dabo Swinney, doesn't just have a goal--he has a dream. And not just any dream. If you're going to dream, you might as well ""be extravagant"" about it,"" he once said.

Ten years ago, when Swinney took over the head coaching position, the school's football program was still thinking small. Swinney transformed the program by first changing the mindset.

In an interview after Clemson's victory on Monday night, Swinney recalled walking into his first board meeting as Clemson's new head coach in 2008. One of the members told Swinney, ""We just want to be a program like Michigan or Florida."" Swinney tried to keep his mouth shut, but his mindset wouldn't allow it. He cut the person off.

""I don't mean this disrespectfully,"" he said, ""but that's not my goal. My vision is for other schools to be like Clemson. My vision is to build a model program.""

For ten years, Swinney says he's been ""intentional"" about achieving that purpose. In an interview for the Clemson Insider after winning his fifth ACC championship game in December (ten years to the day he was hired as head coach) Swinney talked about these dreams.

""I've never been a small dreamer,"" he said. ""I had a lot of time as a kid to dream. There wasn't much else left to do.""

Swinney grew up in a poor family with few contacts, resources, or money. He had something money can't buy--the mindset of a champion.

""You got to be a champion on the inside. You got to be able to see it and have a vision for it. Then you got to go act upon it,"" Swinney said.

Dabo Swinney and Starbucks' Howard Schultz Share The Same Mindset

The Clemson Tigers might not have anything in common with Starbucks--on the surface. But dreamers started both organizations. Swinney's attitude reminds me of a conversation I had several years ago with then-Starbucks CEO, Howard Schultz. ""Dream big. Then dream bigger,"" he said.

Schultz grew up poor in public housing in Brooklyn, New York. But, like Swinney, he didn't allow anyone to place a limit on what he could accomplish. When he had the idea for Starbucks, his business partners at the time thought he was crazy. They were content selling coffee beans. That dream was too small for Schultz.

""The reason I'm here is because I dreamed big dreams. I dreamed the kind of dreams that other people said would not be possible,"" he said.

Schultz also galvanized a team around his vision to create a third place between work and home. Schultz told me, ""When you're surrounded by people who share a passionate commitment around a common purpose, anything is possible.""",
"How do you collaborate with someone you don’t like? They’re not toxic or difficult, you just have different styles, and they rub you the wrong way. It all starts with reflecting on the cause of the tension. Remind yourself: You won’t get along with everyone, but there is potential value in every interaction. Take an honest look at what is causing the tension with you and your colleague and what role you play in creating it. Try to understand your colleague’s perspective. Few people get out of bed in the morning with the goal of making your life miserable. Make time to think deliberately about the other person’s point of view, especially if that person is essential to your success. Rather than trying to work through or around the other person, engage them directly, and try to understand your difference in interpersonal style. You may realize that your styles could be complimentary if you adapt your approaches. Lastly, ask for help. It shows that you value their intelligence and experience.

A few months ago, a former client — let’s call her Kacie— called me to check in. I had supported her through her transition when she had joined a prestigious global financial services firm several months prior. Given how deliberately and thoughtfully she’d gone through the process, I expected that our conversation would be about her early wins.

Instead, Kacie confessed that she had a simple but serious problem: she wasn’t getting along well with a peer-level executive — let’s call her Marta. The two had gotten off on the wrong foot, and as time passed things weren’t getting any better. Kacie told me that it was becoming painfully clear that her inability to get along with Marta was going to impede her success, and possibly derail her career at the company.

As Kacie and I explored the situation, she told me that Marta was seen as a highly talented, accomplished, and well-liked executive — she wasn’t toxic or difficult. But Kacie admitted that she didn’t really like Marta. They had different styles, and Marta rubbed her the wrong way.

Over a series of conversations, Kacie and I worked through the situation. She revisited the stakeholder map she had created in her first few weeks in the role, which clearly showed that Marta’s collaboration and partnership were essential for getting the business results Kacie wanted. In assessing the relationship more honestly, Kacie came to realize that she had been failing to reach out to Marta. She had not made her new colleague feel like her input and perspectives were valuable, had been leaving her and her team off communications, and had more or less been trying to avoid her.

Kacie developed a handful of useful strategies for working better with Marta. While none were particularly easy or comfortable, these are ideas and insights that almost anyone can use when they have to work with someone they just don’t like.

Reflect on the cause of tension and how you are responding to it. The first step is both acceptance and reflection. Remind yourself: You won’t get along with everyone but there is potential value in every interaction with others. You can and should learn from almost everyone you meet, and the responsibility for making that happen lies with you even if the relationship is not an easy one. Take an honest look at what is causing the tension and what role you play in creating it. It may be that your reaction to the situation is at the core of the problem (and you can’t control anything other than your reaction). Kacie had to recognize that Marta’s “unlikability” may really have been about Kacie herself.

Work harder to understand the other person’s perspective. Few people get out of bed in the morning with the goal of making your life miserable. Make time to think deliberately about the other person’s point of view, especially if that person is essential to your success. Ask yourself: Why is this person acting this way? What might be motivating them? How do they see me? What might they want and need from me? Kacie began to think differently about Marta as she came to appreciate that her colleague had goals and motivations as valid as her own and that their goals were not inherently in conflict.

Become a problem solver rather than a critic or competitor. To work better together, it’s important to shift from a competitive stance to a collaborative one. One tactic is to “give” the other person the problem. Rather than trying to work through or around the other person, engage them directly. Kacie invited Marta out to lunch and was open with her: “I don’t feel like we are working together as effectively as we could. What do you think? Do you have any ideas for how we can work better together?” If you ask people to show you their cards, and demonstrate vulnerability in the process, they will often reveal a few of their own.

Ask more questions. In tense situations, many of us try to “tell” our way through it. We might become overly assertive, which usually makes the situation worse. Instead, try asking questions — ideally open-ended ones intended to create conversation. Put aside your own agenda, ask good questions, and have the patience to truly listen to the other person’s answers.

Enhance your awareness of your interpersonal style. It’s easy to chalk up conflicts to poor “chemistry” with another person but everyone has different styles and often being aware of those differences can help. Over lunch, Marta and Kacie discovered that they had both completed the Myers-Briggs earlier in their careers, so they shared their profiles. Kacie is both a clear introvert and a very strong sensing type: she prefers to have time to work through issues alone and quietly, and to draw conclusions from a broad base of data. Marta, on the other hand, is an extrovert and a strong intuitive type, comfortable reacting immediately, focusing on the big picture, and solving problems by talking them through with others. Given these differences in style and preference, Kacie and Marta were bound to find interacting with each other uncomfortable. But once they identified their differences, they realized that their styles could be quite complementary if they adapted and accommodated their approaches.

Ask for help. Asking for help can reboot a difficult relationship because it shows that you value the other person’s intelligence and experience. Over their lunch, Kacie grew confident enough to say to Marta, “You’ve been around here longer than I have. I feel like I’m starting to figure things out, but I’d love your help.” Then she asked questions like: “What should I be doing more or less of? Am I missing anything or failing to connect with anyone I really should? What do you wish someone had told you when you first started working here?”

Kacie and Marta’s relationship significantly improved. During my last call with Kacie, she told me that she and Marta communicate frequently in-person and via text and Slack, and they regularly take part in each other’s team meetings. Each quarter they bring their whole teams together to assess progress and seek opportunities to learn and improve their processes. While Marta and Kacie aren’t necessarily friends and don’t spend a lot of time together outside the office, they’re much better colleagues, and they like each other more than they initially suspected.

Kacie’s success in turning around her relationship with Marta was in part because she acted while “the cement was still wet.” Her negative dynamic with Marta hadn’t yet hardened so Kacie was able to increase her self-awareness, adapt her style, and reach out. It is possible to collaborate effectively with people you don’t like, but you have to take the lead.",
"General Motors CEO Mary Barra has announced that the company will be shuttering some plants and downsizing the workforce accordingly. Communities in the U.S. and Canada will likely be hit hard as workers regroup and figure out what will be next for them. My heart breaks for these good people. This is not supposed to happen in big organizations, is it?

But alas, it does happen. Safety, as it turns out, is a mirage that looks like a big organization with a long and rich history of success. It calls to us. It puts a financial net under us. It gives us a future. Or so we think.

Can any good come from this? Yes. I believe there can be. I’ll even go out on a limb and say this: for some, Mary Barra’s decision will turn out to be the greatest day of their lives.

Here’s why. A remnant of these talented and hard-working people will decide to do something that has been in their hearts for a long time. They’ll turn their dreamer back on. They’ll remember a time when they were more willing to take chances, and they will launch out into the deep sea of entrepreneurship. New businesses will be formed, new ideas will be hatched and these brave captains will sail into a new world, one where they make the decisions and decide the course to take.

That’s what entrepreneurs do, right? Think about the people we admire the most. Arianna Huffington, Sara Blakely, Richard Branson, Elon Musk, Thomas Edison--and on and on the list goes. All of these people had a choice at one time or another to step out on the ledge and do something great, with all of the dangers associated with doing so. They opted out of the tried and true. They saw the mirage, but they chose to avert their glance and build something of their own. They decided, for better or worse, that regret is a lot worse than failure.

Alex Charfen, an Austin Texas entrepreneur and thinker, says that there is a subset of our population that he calls the Entrepreneurial Personality Type. He says we have missed this remarkable tribe of out-of-the-box thinkers, and we have paid a high price for it. For example, many of these people don’t typically do well with the structure of public school, and so they are medicated to help them cope. Many wind up incarcerated. Charfen asserts that we have more entrepreneurs in jail than we do running companies. Could he be right about that?

Thomas Edison, in fact, was famously sent home from his school with a note that said that he was not teachable, that he didn’t fit in, that there was something broken. Thankfully, his mother read the unopened note to herself, and then told him that the school had decided that he was too special to continue his education there. Her encouraging fib helped him become Thomas Edison, the great inventor. It could have been a dark day that he never recovered from. Instead, he went out and did great things that changed the world. In a way, that potentially devastating and life changing event became his defining moment. That happened in large part because of the way it was handled.

I have been through some extremely difficult times. I have learned that it is never the end. There has always been something else out there beyond the current disappointment. Most of the time, that heretofore unseen opportunity is better than I could have imagined, and truthfully, I never would have seen it if I had kept moving forward at breakneck speed. Being stopped is not the worst thing, as it turns out.

My hope for the GM workers and their families is that they will recover, that they will find (or redefine) their calling, and that they will prosper and lift those around them as they go. I wish that for you as well. Wherever you are today and in whatever your circumstances, be fearless. Don’t play it safe. Turn your dreamer back on, find what’s next and change your world.",
"Teachers across the country grapple with two career choices: stay in the classroom or leave. But those don’t have to be the only options. Districts across the country are seeing more value in developing teacher leaders, who are veteran teachers who serve mentors and build school support systems. For teachers, stepping into one of these hybrid roles can give them a chance to advance their careers without leaving the classroom.

Once districts have identified their need for teacher leaders, the next step is finding the right people for the job. Some districts are turning to micro-credentials to train and identify potential teacher leaders. Micro-credentials are certifications that teachers can earn to show they have developed mastery in a certain area. Think of it as a performance assessment for teachers.

Micro-credentials, centered on the idea that teachers need more personalized professional development, have gained popularity over the past several years. They offer teachers the opportunity to learn about something that interests them, try it out in their school setting and demonstrate what they learned. Teachers can receive micro-credentials in a variety of areas, from maker education to anti-bias approaches.

Teaching Matters, a leader in micro-credentials, has issued over 1,000 micro-credentials since 2015. By working in partnerships with districts like the New York Department of Education (NYDOE), they aim to increase teacher effectiveness and teacher leadership opportunities. Through micro-credentials, Teaching Matters is able to give teachers high-quality professional development while holding them accountable for what they learn.

“We talk about deeper learning for kids, giving them meaningful, authentic tasks. This kind of model for professional development is based on authentic tasks. Not homework, but things you should be doing in your professional work,” says Lynette Guastaferro, Teaching Matters’ executive director.

Micro-credentials not only help teachers learn new skills, but they also help teachers transition into new roles. This kind of competency-based professional development is an effective way to train teacher leaders. By receiving micro-credentials, teachers are able to demonstrate that they have the skills needed in order to succeed as a teacher leader. This helps districts to know they are hiring high-quality candidates before bringing new hires on board.

When teachers commit to becoming a teacher leader, they receive coaching, try out different approaches, and reflect on their practice. Along the way, they receive feedback and support to develop the skills they need to succeed. Finally, their performance is assessed with evidence that they can be a teacher leader, allowing both districts and teachers to have confidence in their abilities. As Guastaferro says, “It honestly doesn’t matter what we taught you, it matters that you can do it.”",

Want a job that combines your business acumen, helping others and desire for a great paycheck? Consider becoming a Financial Advisor.

Financial Advisors are professionals who work closely with their clients to help achieve their monetary goals. The job requires an interest in all things money related and a strong sense of empathy and care for your clients.

The star of our video, Trevor Cummings, is a Financial Advisor at The Bahnsen Group. He received his bachelor’s degree in Organizational Leadership from Biola University and his MBA in Finance (Master’s of Business Administration) from California State University Fullerton. Trevor enjoys the relationships and trust building element of his job and feels the most pride when he sees his clients succeed in their financial dreams.

There is no better time than now to become a Financial Advisor. The U.S. Department of Labor projects 15 percent job growth in the career by 2026, much faster than average. You can work in any state, and the median pay is $90,000. If you are looking for a point of entry, retail banking can serve as the first rung on the financial advisor career ladder. Here are four steps to becoming a Financial Advisor:

No matter the specialization, all financial advisors work to accomplish the same thing — helping clients manage and grow their finances. Effective money management is every client’s priority, so the job comes with a lot of responsibility. Every day will be different, but you always want to make your client happy at the end of the day. When your client sees returns on their investments, so will you.

A bachelor’s degree is required to be a financial advisor. Majors in finance, economics, and business are common but not necessary. Many financial advisors also obtain an MBA.

Get the Right Experience

There are multiple ways to obtain experience as a financial advisor. The best avenue is through an internship with financial firms. Internships provide training and a better understanding of the job. Another route is in retail banking.

Not all financial advising services require certificates or licenses. Once you land an entry-level job, the particular field you work in and at what level of service you provide clients is the indicator of what certificates and licenses are required. To obtain these will require time, coursework, exams, and continued education.",None
"Many companies tend to search for fresh, young talent when hiring. However, the unemployment rate for those aged 55 and older was just 3.2% earlier this year, meaning more companies appear to be open to leveraging the knowledge and experience of older workers.

There is a major labor and talent shortage in the business world, affecting companies across industries. Organizations, especially nonprofits, can benefit from those more seasoned employees, but they must be willing to make the hire. The experts of Forbes Nonprofit Council shared their thoughts on how to integrate younger and older workers for the best outcome.

If you are able to achieve a good mix of age ranges in your workforce, congrats. You will be far more successful than companies that aren't as diverse. Once you have this workforce, cross train using the employees as trainers, and allow different age groups to learn from each other. This way, they not only learn the job, but also they get to see things from another perspective. - Tom Van Winkle, Hinsdale Humane Society

2. Support The Needs Of Older Workers

Generally speaking, a company culture that honors experience will benefit older workers and encourage them to stay. Beyond a supportive culture, research demonstrates that companies can increase their retention of mature workers by offering flexible work arrangements, providing leadership training and development opportunities and facilitating knowledge management and transfer. - Anthony (Tony) Kronfli, The Methuselah Foundation

To glean the most out of multigenerational teams, intentionally group teams of two to four from different generations to work on projects together and, if possible, bring different departments or specialties together. This fosters a culture of inclusion and proves that each generation brings knowledge and talent to the table. This diverse approach can yield financial and social dividends. - Kimberly Lewis, Goodwill Industries of East Texas, Inc.

Older workers have amassed great experiences, which are ripe for teaching. Younger workers are eager to make an immediate impact but sometimes lack the knowledge to make a thoughtful impact. I believe this can be solved by creating programs that give older workers a platform to share knowledge and giving younger generations of workers an opportunity to get involved with the decision-making process. - Eric Griswold, The $100 Solution™

To fully leverage intellectual capital, an organization must create a culture of inclusion amongst all of its workers, young and old alike. Knowledge flow from all must not only be welcomed but fostered. Ground rules must be set, too, including that there are no titles in the room, no bad ideas and that negative criticism is never permitted from anyone, as that instantly stymies participation. - Kenneth Deans, Health Sciences South Carolina

We focus on setting a tone of collaboration -- that everyone who comes to work for our organization has value and expertise that can support our mission. We work very hard to reject the tone of competition so all of our employees see that we value their gifts and so should their colleagues and that none of our employees feels stepped over or ignored. - Steven Moore, M.J. Murdock Charitable Trust

We look at where people have skills and slot them in regardless of age. For tech jobs, we have many younger workers, while older workers take on some of the new roles as well as traditional roles. We appreciate everyone at every age. - Gloria Horsley, Open to Hope

Many organizations develop elaborate strategies to attract and engage millennial workers. What they may be missing in their approach is how to integrate the younger workforce with older employees. Let the young ones offer as much as they get from the mentoring arrangement. Have them help older colleagues embrace technology or learn new skills in exchange for their experience. Create partnerships! - Magdalena Nowicka Mook, ICF (International Coach Federation)",
"Executive leaders who want to speed up their job search would do well to update their profile and network on LinkedIn.

Beyond networking, LinkedIn is an active place for recruiters to search for -- and vet -- candidates. According to a 2017 Jobvite survey, 87% of recruiters use LinkedIn when searching for ideal candidates.

Take these steps to optimize your profile and become more active on Linkedin:

1. Use plenty of keywords in the correct fields.

Use keywords several times throughout your profile. Fields that are keyword searchable include your headline, summary, location, job title, job description, volunteer experience, skills, activities, publications, honors and awards, organizations, etc.

Recruiters search LinkedIn like a big database for candidates, and the keywords they use may lead them to you. Sample keywords might be ""project manager,"" ""SAP,"" ""Agile,"" ""San Francisco"" and ""PMP"" (project management professional). Identify your necessary keywords by looking at the titles and key phrases in sample job descriptions as well as industry keywords.

2. Write an engaging summary that communicates your brand and clarifies how to reach out.

If a recruiter wants to reach out to you, make it easy to do so by including your email within the summary.

The summary should be written in the first person (“I am an engaging project manager”) whereas the resume is written in a more formal, redacted way (""Engaging project manager"").

The summary should summarize your strengths, branding statements and value proposition, and should compel the reader to reach out to you directly.

3. Use the right zip code and industry for your profile.

Recruiters will search for candidates by zip code. If you want to relocate to a new city, consider using that city’s zip code in your profile (assuming you’re not conducting a confidential job search). For example, if you’re considering a move to North Carolina (a favorite among my clients due to the strong economy and favorable weather), use a zip code near where you’d like to live in the new city. If possible, use the zip code of a friend or relative.

Fill in the most accurate industry, usually the one for which you have the most experience or the most interest in for your next position.

4. Have at least three to four recommendations.

Try to have a variety of people recommend you, like your boss, a direct report or a client. Coach the person on what you’d want them to focus on. Better yet, if they are willing to write a recommendation, offer to create a draft for them and suggest they edit it as they see fit. This will show them what you want them to focus on and take less of their time in the process.

Connect with recruiters so you can hopefully appear at the top of their searches. Follow leaders in your industry and at your target company. Consider connecting with others inside the target company who are peers from a networking perspective; they may be connected to the hiring manager and recruiter there. Join groups in your profession and reach out to people through these groups.

It's a bit trickier to try to connect with hiring managers, since blindly connecting with them could appear too forward and become a turnoff. Join groups they might belong to and connect with them out of having similar interests and being fellow group members.

6. Have at least 50 connections and keep adding.

If you want to be aggressive, look to add three to five new connections a day. Continue to grow your network and aim for 500 as a solid start.

Reach out to friends and former colleagues, join relevant groups and connect with other group members. Write a customized connection request so they're more likely to accept. Share how you know the person and why you’d like to connect (to keep in touch, so you can offer assistance, etc.). Do not ask for anything right away (jobs, sales, etc.). Instead, start out by focusing entirely on how you can help the other person.

7. Join job search groups, but hide them on your public profile.

Join groups within your industry, job role and network in the city or cities where you’d like to work. If you join jobseeker groups and you’re still employed, just be sure to turn off the option to keep groups visible on your public profile.

With a complete (formerly called “all-star”) LinkedIn profile, users are much more likely to get contacted about job opportunities. Fill in standard sections at the beginning, ensuring you also have a current position, summary and a photo. Add your skills and have at least 50 connections. Fill in your experience for job descriptions, and make sure you have a current job posted.

9. Do not post your resume.

Make the reader reach out to you for your resume instead of posting it on LinkedIn. If they have to reach out, you then have their name and email and can follow up with them.

Post articles, comment on others’ articles and stay involved in the latest trends within your industry and job role.

By taking these steps on LinkedIn, you’ll be well on your way to landing your new job and establishing yourself as a leader in your field.",
"Even staff members who’ve earned a reputation as great workers may struggle to find opportunities to move up the leadership ladder. Sometimes managers are so focused on what team members already do well that they overlook their potential as leaders.

This can lead to an exhausting and frustrating cycle for professionals who wish to advance in their careers. If you want to land a leadership role in your company, you must not only exhibit the right qualities but make sure the higher-ups at your company notice your efforts and know about your goals. To improve your chances of landing a leadership position, follow these tips from members of Forbes Coaches Council.

1. Tell Current Leadership You Want To Join Them

Put yourself out there! Proactively let your leaders know you are interested in expanding into a broader leadership role, and back that up by taking on projects that highlight your abilities to influence and get things done. Whether it is managing the holiday event committee or raising your hand to lead a cross-functional team project, everything is an opportunity to show your leadership ability. - Tonya Echols, Thrive Coaching Solutions

2. Always Overperform And Inspire Others To Do The Same

No one cares how hard you work. Bosses expect their subordinate leaders to produce expected results, on time and on budget. Great leaders consistently overperform. They consistently produce expected results early and under budget. The way to produce more is through the efforts of the team you lead. Want to be noticed for leadership? Inspire your team to exceed expectations. You will be noticed. - Col. John Boggs, Fortitude Consulting, LLC

3. Adapt And Exhibit The Leadership Qualities Valued By Your Company

Working is not the same as leading. Identify the leadership qualities valued by those in authority and begin exercising those qualities in your communication, your interpersonal relationships and your time. Is ambition valued? Then sign up for leadership workshops and talks given by company management. Be visible. Ask questions. Sit in the front of the room. Offer to take point on a project. - Erica McCurdy, LunaNav, LLC

4. Raise Your Visibility By Representing The Company

When coaching leaders who are being groomed for the next level, I recommend they raise their visibility within their industry. They can volunteer for committees, write articles for the blog or be a guest speaker at association events. Higher-ups rarely have time to do this, so you’re doing them a favor by representing the company within the industry. You never know what doors this might open. - Gabriella Goddard, Brainsparker Leadership Academy

5. Look For Ways To Fill In The Gaps

A mistake aspiring leaders make is being vocal and busy. They try hard to get noticed as a leader and start their leadership journey off on the wrong foot. Leadership is about understanding risks, engaging people and building strategies. Take initiative to develop those skills and help existing leadership fill in gaps. Be present and lead upward to get noticed as an aspiring leader. - Tony Mickle, Big Box Coaching

6. Study Your Industry And Help Your Colleagues Develop Their Skills

Lead from where you are. Effective leadership is more than being a hard worker. Demonstrate leadership qualities and take greater initiative in team meetings. Elevate your perspective beyond just your success to help develop less experienced employees around you. Identify opportunities and challenges affecting your industry to expand your next conversation with your leader. Executives will notice. - Julianne Cenac, Ph.D., The Leader Channel

7. Focus On Gaining Influence On Your Team

While counterintuitive, if your current team doesn’t believe you should be promoted, it will limit how the higher-ups view you. Leaders spot other leaders by the positive vibe they create on the team and how this positively influences the team to reach its goals. Having a positive influence with others is the best way to get noticed. - Carry Metkowski

8. Show That You Can Do The Job You Want

Focus on the role you desire! When I aimed to be promoted to vice president at my company, I was already performing the responsibilities of the role while executing the responsibilities of my current role. To change perceptions and show that I was ready to perform at the next level of leadership, I needed to emphasize strategic skills while still executing daily tasks. Brand your new identity and role. - Rosie Guagliardo, InnerBrilliance Coaching",
"Organization, for creative types, can be a lot. For me, design and organization always paired well together, but I know plenty of creators and entrepreneurs who really struggle with the organizational aspect of their business. Unfortunately, I cannot put everything in tidy boxes for you. However, when it comes to design files, videos, and such, let's talk what's new on the market to help.

Spending disproportionate amounts of time attempting to find files, feeling overwhelmed by not being able to find files, taking entire days out to attempt to organize said files across several platforms, attempting to share files that are so large they actually buffer and fail... this is wasting your time, resources, and ultimately costing you money. And these aren't exaggerations. These are real problems designers, creators, and entrepreneurs face often. Often enough for a new service called FileShadow to come on the scene, aimed at dissolving these issues once and for all.

Where Do You Store Everything?

If you're like me, there isn't one answer. I use a range of cloud-based storage because I work with a wide range of clients from around the world, and I do not expect them to change their platform to appease me. If you're like most designers or entrepreneurs, you've got files in Dropbox, iCloud, Box, Google Drive, and so on. Which begs the question: when you need to find or share a file, how do you know where to look? Have you lost files and been forced to redo work? Have you lost projects, contracts, etc? According to Tyrone F. Pike, President and CEO of FileShadow, ""We have stuff everywhere, and we have no idea how to get to it.""

Again, we see, that a business aimed at using modern tools to solve common, widespread problems, will scale fast  because it solves a very real problem. FileShadow is in this category because their ultimate goal is to help people protect their assets, have easy access to them, and to offer this without them having to move everything around. Their system doesn't force users to change their process... it runs on top of it, which is a win-win if I've ever heard of one. My goal, in sharing this, is to help make your life easier in business, to help you find organization in areas that might be overwhelming for you to organize, and ultimately- to make more money by staying in your creative genius.

Jeff Looman is the Vice President of Engineering at FileShadow, Inc. He has worked in software development for more than 35 years as an engineer, in engineering management, product management, and product placement strategies. Mr. Pike and Mr. Looman talked to me about how they went out and interviewed over 100 prosumers. They found, on average, individuals were using between four to five separate cloud accounts, with no real system for organization or way to find what they were looking for.

Secondarily, they found that if the prosumer found the file, the second big issue everyone seemed to be running into was sharing, so this was really a two-part problem they were facing down.

Working smarter, now and in the future, includes allowing technology to work hard for you, and taking advantage of the multi-layered protection you can easily tap into. Losing, unintentionally deleting, corrupted files... make these a thing of the past.  If you are ending your year overwhelmed and unfocused, your New Year's Resolution might be best to involve getting organized once and for all.",
"Congratulations! You’ve gotten through the hard part: hiring a new direct report to join your ranks. Hopefully they’ll be starting soon and you can get going on all the exciting goals you’ve set for them in their new role.

But before their first day arrives, there are a few things you as a manager should do to prepare to welcome a new employee with open arms. Some are more logistical—like figuring out where they’ll be sitting and what they’ll be working on in their first week—while others are about ensuring that the person feels appreciated, included, and comfortable coming into a new work environment. In fact, many of these tips are drawn from things we do here at The Muse when new hires join our team.

Here’s what you need to do in the week before they arrive.

You’re about to work together closely, so why not let them into your professional network? You certainly don’t want to have to awkwardly request them after months spent sitting next to them every day.

Additionally, this is a great opportunity to welcome them before they’ve even entered the office. When you request to connect, include a nice note along the lines of:

Hey [Name], just wanted to say I’m so excited to work with you and can’t wait to reconnect in person!

Welcome to the [Company] team! We’re all thrilled to have you join us.

This is probably the most important step to take whenever you hire someone new. This document will be the person’s life raft as they get situated in their role. It should include:

Ultimately, the more you document the better—that way you proactively answer any questions they may have.

In many cases, it might even make sense to have the person’s direct teammates contribute information about projects they’ll be working on together or should know about. This gives your new hire the lowdown, while also allowing your other direct reports to feel more involved in training their new teammate.

Lucky for you, we have the perfect onboarding template for you to work off of. Created by our founder and president Alex Cavoulacos, this is the template we often use to help our newest team members get situated.

Your head is probably swimming with ideas, questions, and opportunities for this new employee.

Rather than let those thoughts get away, start a document to jot down anything that comes to mind. You may find you won’t need or want to address them when the person actually starts, but having them written down will make you feel confident you’ve covered everything.

The best bosses do this! Why? Well, as Muse writer and editor Stav Ziv points out, your new employee probably just went through an exhausting stretch of giving notice and transitioning out of their last role. And, “as a manager who wants this person to hit the ground running, you’d obviously hate for your shiny new employee to start off on a stressful note.”

Sending an email before they start to convey how happy you are that they’re joining the team will make them that much more excited for their next adventure. It can cover some important stuff, too. Obviously you want to welcome them to the team, but you can also use that note—if HR hasn’t already—to address their official arrival date and time, discuss company dress code or culture, request any relevant documents like their passport or ID, or even provide an outline of their first-day schedule.

Of course, you should always end by letting them know that you’re happy to answer any questions they have before they start. As someone who has been on the other side, I’m sure you know how intimidating it can be to start a new job with zero context. So make it really easy for them to feel comfortable walking in the door that first day.

Read more about what that welcome email should look like (and use the handy template!).

This may require some IT help, but make sure everything technical is squared away. Getting this done now saves you from spending three hours on day one figuring out how to turn their laptop on.

Do they have a computer ready for them, and is it charged and updated? Do they have an email account set up? How about setting up your internal chat system or other important programs they’ll need access to?

Is their desk space clean and empty? Are you sure you’ve moved out everything belonging to the last person who sat there? Is there any other equipment—a keyboard, mouse, USB, extra monitor, extension cord, or filing cabinet—they may need that you can provide?

This is most likely your new employee’s first stop when they arrive, so make it a welcoming space. Throwing in some company swag, their favorite snack, or even a card signed by the team never hurts, either!

These may be included in your email to the new hire, but it also may make sense to share any documents you want them to review beforehand in a separate email. This could be your company’s employee handbook and benefits packages or your team’s onboarding document.

Regardless, give the person context so they know why you’re sharing these documents, what they mean for their role, when you expect them to look them over, and if they need to prepare anything.

Maybe your company has a buddy program. At The Muse, every new hire is given a “Muse Buddy” from another team that they grab coffee with their first week to talk about our company culture and mingle outside the office.

If there’s no formal system in place, consider pairing your upcoming new hire with a “mentor” outside your team—it could be someone they may not work with directly or someone in a completely different department.

This helps the new hire immediately get to know others within the company, and it also gives them another outlet for asking questions they might be afraid to bring up with a manager they barely know. Having a third-party contact can ease some of their concerns and allow them to be more open and curious about your company’s culture and workflow.

Just be sure whoever you choose is available and eager to be a mentor—nothing’s worse than connecting your new hire to someone who immediately ghosts them.

Just as you need to prepare your new hire for getting onboarded, you also need to prepare yourself for doing the onboarding.

Training a new employee takes time—time you usually spend on your day-to-day responsibilities. So it’s smart to proactively set aside slots when you’ll be working closely with this person so you can gauge how you’ll get the rest of your work done.

Not only should you be scheduling at least one one-on-one meeting every day their first week to check in on their progress, but also making time for any training sessions they’ll need to attend that you’ll be joining.

Doing this gives you a chance to reserve any conference rooms or other resources you might need. If you’re onboarding a remote employee, for example, you’ll want to make sure your video chat works and you both have a space to talk privately. Or, if you need to loop in a third team member (or several), you should check and see if they’re available to meet that day.

Hitting the ground running is a priority, but so is getting to know your employee as a person (with a life outside work!)—and letting the rest of your team get to know them, too.

Schedule an outing (or two) for your team to grab lunch, coffee, or drinks together so that it’s on everyone’s calendar ahead of time. You can keep it intimate with just your direct team, but if it’s a smaller company you can consider inviting other departments you work with to join as well.

This isn’t about showing off your newest talent, but rather providing your new employee with an opportunity to bond with their colleagues outside the office. And being the kind of boss who values camaraderie and fun as much as hard work. Keep the talk to non-work related topics (but keep it appropriate). If you need some conversation starters, check out these great get-to-know-you questions.

When I first started, the entire editorial team went out to a nice lunch, and we’ve done the same for other new team members since. Not only was it a treat to splurge on the company card, but it also immediately shattered any awkwardness we felt toward one another.

Check all these things off your list, and your new employee will start off on the best possible note—and so will you!",

"Why do they claim success be easy? A revolutionary new strategy. A groundbreaking discovery. An ingenious hack. Whatever it is... the success you've dreamed of will finally be easy.

Which of course sounds great -- and sells a lot of plans and programs -- because ""easy"" is nearly as tempting as ""free.""

Or not: According to science, saying it will be easy to accomplish a difficult goal -- and believing it will be easy to accomplish a difficult goal -- is the worst thing you can do.

New research on long-term weight loss includes a surprising revelation. When participants were told how hard it is to lose weight and keep it off... when participants were told that maintaining the self-control needed would be really hard... they actually maintained greater self-control.

Which is why these are the two most important words you can use when you try to accomplish a huge:

Granted, saying it's hard seems counterintuitive. Telling someone else that a challenge is hard might only serve to discourage them. Telling yourself that a challenge is hard is likely to discourage you from even starting.

""Rather than acting as cheerleaders giving facile encouragement, leaders of weight loss groups might serve their clients better by providing a more sobering description of the challenges participants face. Questioning the usefulness of building self-control skills... may have bolstered the very capacity it was meant to downplay -- stronger self-control with regard to food.""

Tell me that doing something hard will actually be easy naturally leads to unrealistic expectations.

When times inevitably get tough -- as times always do -- I'll quit. It was supposed to be easy.

Tell me that doing something hard will actually be hard... that I might not have what it takes to accomplish it... that it will require more of me than I might possibly be able to give... and when times inevitably get tough, I'm prepared. I knew it was coming. ""Hard"" is an expected part of the process.

And I'll be much more likely to stay the course -- if only to prove that what you thought about me was wrong.

The next time you encourage someone to do something difficult, don't sugar-coat the effort involved. Don't claim it will be easy, or simple, or painless.

Instead, say, ""It's hard.""  Say, ""You can do it... but it's going to take an incredible amount of hard work."" Say, ""You can do it... but it's going to take a ton of willpower and mental toughness.""

The same holds true when you decide to take on a huge challenge. Don't try to convince yourself it will be easy. Admit it will be hard. Embrace the fact the road will will be hard.

That way, when times get tough, when you think you've done all you can... you won't mind as much.",
"It's been a tough couple of weeks for me, with a wrenching series of the unexpected deaths of friends--all entrepreneurs and/or educators in their own way--aged mid-50s to mid-90s. Several died abruptly without the slightest indication of illness--brutal bolts from the blue. Others left us at a time when we earnestly believed that they were in the midst of bouncing back and regaining their strength. So much the sadder given the immense struggles that preceded their demises.

These are frightening episodes for those of us of a certain age because they are the most immediate and stark reminders of our own mortality. Whatever anyone else tells you, these painful passings are never expected or easy, in terms of being prepared for the event, ready for the surprising and palpable pain, or able to deal with the sinking sense of loss. Nor do we exactly understand the mixed feelings of relief that we experience in some morbid fashion on the putative behalf of the deceased. Every death, by definition, is unfairly premature and always comes too soon. This is never about getting over such things; just a matter of trying to successfully muddle through them with some semblance of grace and respect. The pain may eventually lessen and the scars start to heal, but the wound remains forever.

But in those first and early moments of the searing knowledge-=before the procedures and the protocols kick in, before life resumes and the rush of essential events takes over and moves things along with an irresistible (and grudgingly welcome) force of their own--you have a brief window of reflection. You realize that, while death may end a life, it doesn't extinguish the long history, the many mixed emotions, the complex connections, and the underlying relationships that were a part of your life together and which withstood the many trials and tribulations of time.

And, if you permit yourself, your exploration often extends beyond the immediate losses of certain individuals to recall and remember (and perhaps cerebrally celebrate) others who are also no longer a prominent presence in your life, but to whom you owe much. I've written that entrepreneurs are lousy at saying thank you, but there seems to me to be an even deeper deficiency. It's not enough to thank our employees and our investors and random others, if we don't also remember to reach out to thank the critical contributors who were steadfastly there at the start.

At our business schools, we regularly debate the ""nature versus nurture"" controversy, essentially discussing whether entrepreneurs are just born a certain way and destined to pursue new ventures, or whether anyone with an interest (and hopefully some measure of passion) can be taught the critical skills for startup success. I'm firmly in the ""it's in your genes"""" camp, except that I don't really think that heredity explains everything or that entrepreneurs themselves give enough credit to the critical importance of the roles played by their parents, professors, mentors and, to a much lesser extent, their peers.

And, by the way, I don't mean to suggest that the role and the impact of these other parties is necessarily a positive influence or a supportive one--just that it's often a very powerful one that is under-appreciated and only occasionally acknowledged. Everyone you encounter on the journey teaches you something--some are good examples and role models and others are important warnings about what not to be or do. Sometimes a blessing, sometimes no more than a passing breeze, and sometimes a boot.

But for so many entrepreneurs, the real start and the best part of the journey was when they were kids at home. Home, where they have to take you in, home, where the support and love is unconditional, and home where many of the essential habits, attitudes, and values are initially built, regularly reinforced and eventually absorbed. Who doesn't have half a dozen mottos, slogans or aphorisms burnt into their brain from Mom or Dad? These aren't just pithy phrases or clichés. It turns out that they're pretty important life lessons. And, although GEICO's ads make light of it, maybe turning into our parents in some ways isn't the worst thing that could happen. After all, they raised us and we turned out pretty well, so how bad could they have been?

So it's worth a moment from time to time, especially if you still have a chance to say it to their faces before they're gone, to think about and thank your parents for their patience and thick skins, their perseverance at times when you were clearly a lost cause, and their persistent part in your eventual and plentiful successes. No time like the present and never too soon or too often. Don't wait for a fire or a funeral and, for sure, don't wait until it's too late.

After all, they're the ones who taught us that it's not the tears and sadness, but the desire and the determination to move forward that ultimately makes the pain of loss bearable. So find an opportunity over the holidays and make it a moment of celebration and not sadness.

As the Boss says in The Wish: ""Well tonight I'm takin' requests here in the kitchen. This one's for you, ma, let me come right out and say it. It's overdue, but baby, if you're looking for a sad song, well I ain't gonna play it.""",
"In a recent meeting, a member shared that she was struggling to hire the right COO. She asked for guidance from the group on how to ensure a strong cultural fit when going through the recruiting and interviewing process.

Every member in attendance could empathize with her situation, and I could as well. Here are 10 strategies all leaders can use to strengthen their hiring process, and improve their ability to identify candidates that will culturally fit with their companies.

At my first firm Information Experts, I was always the last person to interview key hires. Employee perspectives are critical to the hiring process because our employees see and experience things we don't. Our 360-degree hiring process ensured that the employees with whom a new hire will be working would be able to voice their opinion regarding the candidate's overall organizational fit.

There is so much that goes into culture alignment: company size, company values, the markets that the company serves, mission-driven versus non-mission driven, hard-driving or more collaborative. We often serve as the outsourced CCO (Chief Culture Officer) for several clients and are actively engaged in their hiring processes to ensure cultural alignment. We also schedule weekly check-ins with new hires for the first few months to ensure they are successfully integrating.

Seek out candidates that have already achieved what you seek.

Especially for a leadership position, you don't want your company to be a training ground for a new hire. In positions where there is a small margin of error, your candidates should have a solid track record in a company of your size.

It's important to get as granular as possible when trying to fill a key position, so that there are no surprises and no misalignments of expectations. This exercise forces you to get clarity for you and your candidates.

Rolling out values to candidates after you've hired them is too late. Your core values, and the behaviors you expect of employees, should be weaved into your hiring process. We develop custom values-based questions for our clients that require candidates to share how the values have shown up in their lives.

No one knows your company like you do. You may not be an expert in all of the skills required for the position you are trying to fill, but you are an expert in your company. Make decisions from a place of confidence rather than fear.

It's better to be without someone than to hire the wrong person. The wrong person may seem like a quick fix but ultimately they will cause more problems and liability for the company.

There are many personality assessments available today. Consult an expert to determine which is best for your organization to determine the type of talent that will thrive under your leadership.

Trust your intuition. Listen to your red flags. One of my CEO members asks her team to hold er accountable, and not let her ignore the red flags she sees in candidates when she is anxious to fill a position. Her team does not allow her to make a unilateral hiring decision.

Remember that everyone you interview will present their best versions of themselves. It's easy for leaders to dismiss red flags when they are trying to fill key positions. These strategies can help companies of all stages and sizes safeguard against poor cultural fits, and instead hire those that will have long, mutually rewarding careers.",None
"With companies focused on an aging workforce poised to retire and job-hopping millennials, employee retention has become an even hotter topic. Lots of companies are feeling the double-whammy of hiring costs and talent shortages. Whether you’re struggling to find and keep employees with the right skills, or you’re just a savvy manager who really gets the importance of supporting your staff, you may want to shift your focus from retaining employees to engaging them.

Frankly, the concept of retention alone is pretty meaningless. It speaks only to keeping employees on payroll for as long as possible, ignoring whether those employees are actually productive and motivated. Engagement is about creating an environment where employees are highly motivated and committed to the work you’ve hired them to do. Big difference.

Employee engagement has become so important that it moves the dial in terms of whether a company can be called “a great place to work” or not. So if you're building your own engaged work environment, you might want to check out Glassdoor’s most recent list of “Best Places to Work for 2019” to get a feel for what to focus on.

Key lessons and insights from the list to apply to your own leadership efforts:

Get employee feedback . Nothing beats going straight to the source — employees. Who better to explain what the workplace feels like on a day-to-day basis? There are plenty of creative ways to seek input, from simply asking to leveraging employee surveys. Whatever you do, make it easy for employees to share what impacts them and their productivity. And remember: If you ask for feedback, you must follow up and share what you’re doing with it.

Share feedback . Discussing what you hear from employees demonstrates transparency, makes employees feel valued and builds trust. Forget about trying to look good here. Keeping negative comments to yourself, in this case, can quickly disconnect you from your employees. They know what the “word on the street” is, and if leadership isn’t willing to address that, they’ll disengage — which, after all, is the opposite of what you’re after. Of course, you also have to address the issues, but communicating about the data you’re collecting is a great place to start.

Be mission-driven and collaborative . These are key attributes that employees considered when rating their companies in the Best Places to Work Report for 2019. Employees are looking to feel connected to the work they do and the people they do it for. The more they understand and believe in the “why” behind their work, the more they’ll be inspired to go above and beyond.

Discuss career goals . This isn’t the same as promising promotions. Don’t make the mistake of assuming all career conversations are about raises and new titles. At least once a year, carve out 30 minutes to one hour to sit down one-on-one with each of your employees and discuss their career interests and goals. Be sure to keep this meeting separate from performance reviews. That way, you demonstrate that you are thinking about your employees’ goals and looking for opportunities to assign work that aligns with what drives them.

Reinforce the benefits of benefits . As a leader, you should be fully versed in all the benefits available to your staff. Often, companies provide benefits that include tuition assistance, vendor discounts, spot bonuses and others that go beyond the basic healthcare coverage. However, I rarely see managers who educate their staff about these resources or encourage them to take advantage of them. Don’t wait for someone to inquire. By taking the lead, you’ll signal that the company is invested in their growth and well-being. Even supporting and respecting an employee’s time off by encouraging them to take all of their earned vacation time (and leaving them alone while off the clock) can speak volumes about how much you care about your staff.

Whether your company snagged a spot on the “Best Places to Work for 2019” list or you’re aspiring to become a workplace of choice, know that your commitment to support your staff will not only improve morale and boost productivity, it will also hone your capabilities as a leader and, dare I say, a human.",coaching
"One of the best ways to grow a business and gain attention for your brand is to team up with another company. Partnering gives each party access to the others' skill sets and resources, which can greatly expand their individual capabilities.

For a partnership to succeed, each of the businesses involved must be fully committed and should understand their respective responsibilities. We asked a panel of Forbes Business Development Council members for their advice on creating a successful business partnership. Here are their must-have partnership characteristics — and some of the benefits these elements could bring to your collaborative efforts.

One person from each side of the partnership needs to ""own"" that partnership. The two partnership leads on either side need to check in weekly and represent their teams. As a business development professional, I have served in this role many times. It requires being proactive, communicative, organized, clear on both sides' goals and progress, and a good relationship builder. - Robin Farmanfarmaian, Actavalon

In a lot of partnerships, both teams are so excited about the upsides of doing business together that they miss the step of determining accountability, which they would take in their own organizations. There should be a discussion up front about where the accountability for results falls and what the consequences will be if goals aren’t met. - Brandon Ficara, Toco Warranty

In my experience, partnerships fail because one party isn't prepared to fully commit. From the beginning of the relationship, both sides need to be willing to put skin into the game — both financially and resource-wise. The success of one is tightly intertwined with the success of the other. This way, objectives will always stay aligned because both parties are equally committed to the partnership. - Christian Valiulis, Automatic Payroll System

When companies or individuals partner to create new solutions, the only way things will stay on track is if both parties have a shared goal. If one party is only interested in serving a personal interest, then the joint effort will be one-sided. There must be a genuine mutual interest in seeing the creation thrive, and then the rest — communication, focus, and so on — will fall into place more naturally. - Ashley Cheeks, MBA, Written Success

Setting expectations from the beginning is key. Being direct and outlining what the expected outcomes from the partnership for both parties will look like at the beginning of the project will help determine if the partnership will be successful. The key is defining what success looks like first and then working your way back from there. - Lisa Box, WP Engine, Inc.

Partnerships often dissolve over time due to the fact that one party benefits more from the partnership than the other. Over the course of time, if the party that isn't benefiting as much isn't finding value or reward, the effort they put toward the partnership could lessen and eventually dissolve altogether. The key to making partnerships work is to agree upon the inputs and outputs from both parties up front. - Jen Tadin, Gallagher

The first and foremost step for teaming up to create dynamic new products or services in a joint partnership model is to come up with success criteria jointly and have a continuous action plan attached to it. Track the plan and make people accountable. Jumping right into the strategy to create the products or services, or actually creating the products or services, may not get the desired results for the partnership. - Mehul Agarwal, WinWire

When you're building a partnership, always aim to work with companies who offer the same level of service and quality reputation as yours. In my field (trucking), we partner with other companies throughout the U.S. to offer better pricing and service than we could if we had to dispatch the trailers from our home base. Having good communication and a trusting relationship is key for this to be successful. - Craig McGraw, Trans American Trucking & Warehouse",
"The concept of psychological safety, according to William A. Khan in his 1990 paper on personal engagement and disengagement at work, is “being able to show and employ one’s self without fear of negative consequences of self-image, status or career.""

The actual term was coined as early as 1999 by Amy Edmondson but popularly cited from her 2002 paper on the subject. She explains, “In psychologically safe environments, people believe that if they make a mistake, others will not penalize or think less of them for it. They also believe that others will not resent or penalize them for asking for help, information or feedback. This belief fosters the confidence to take the risks described above and thereby to gain from the associated benefits of learning.”

It has become readily apparent in today’s technologically intensive and rapidly changing business landscape that conditions that will support the psychological safety of all employees in an organization are necessary for ongoing success. Despite this, there are companies out there that haven’t yet embraced this philosophy.

Have you ever worked for an organization that had no intention of providing even cursory psychological safety? If you haven’t, you probably know someone who has.

I know a manager who worked at an international company for three years. This organization proclaimed its values were diversity, truthfulness and trust. Posters in the hallways promoted this, and performance reviews were graded on it.

Unfortunately, it was, for the most part, a myth. When the results of the annual, center-wide, “anonymous” survey came out, middle management was routinely criticized for the dismal employee ratings for the statement, “I trust management, and feel safe expressing my ideas and concerns."" Then middle management was chastised a second time for the dismal survey ratings they gave upper management for the same statement.

Upper management never seemed to understand the irony: Middle management was being routinely reproved for expressing their ideas and concerns in an anonymous survey. Despite the obvious remedy of listening to employees without inflicting repercussions, upper management never made any attempt to solve this ongoing problem.

Elbert Green Hubbard said, “The greatest mistake you can make in life is continually fearing that you'll make one.” Without psychological safety in the workplace, it is all too easy to become discouraged and simply move on to a hopefully more supportive organization. Employees now have the benefit of obtaining instant information on a place of work from the internet. With employee review sites such as Glassdoor, Indeed and FairyGodBoss, it’s easier than ever to get a preview of what a company’s culture is really like, as opposed to what they claim to be like on the “About Us” page of their own website.

If a firm is truly interested in fostering innovation, teamwork and accelerated productivity, there are steps they can take to foster an environment of psychological safety.

Understand that mistakes can and will be made without fear of retribution or consequences. Mistakes simply need to be acknowledged. They can then be used as a springboard for new ideas.

Make sure everyone is heard. Do the same three people voice all the opinions or ideas at every meeting? Encourage wider participation. Reticent team members may need encouragement to speak up. They may only feel comfortable answering a direct question. In meetings, no one is allowed to interrupt or belittle another speaker. Opinions and ideas are valuable and may come from the most unlikely members.

Encourage questions and feedback. Are you unconsciously doing or saying something that is impeding the process?  If no one feels safe speaking up, you’ll never know.

Develop trust between participants by sharing. Team members can relate to personal stories, triumphs and challenges. Forming a group bond is important in developing a cooperative environment that encourages participation.

Active listening is important to really hear what the other team members are trying to convey. This is no time to be checking the calendar on your cell phone. It’s OK to ask questions or request a clarification on a participant’s idea. Be open to hearing opinions other than your own.

Diversity in mindset is necessary for success. If everyone on the team thinks the same, there is no impetus to try anything new or different, and stagnation will be the result. Having a team that includes different viewpoints is essential for innovation.

If your organization doesn’t have a culture of psychological safety, it can be a big change to implement, and a bit daunting. There are many good books and articles with information on the subject that can offer ideas and support for converting the mindset of your organization. The results of providing a safe and supportive organizational culture can be amazing.",
"While promoting his upcoming movie The Old Man and the Gun, Robert Redford announced his retirement from his six-decade career as an actor. Time Magazine quoted Redford as saying, “Never say never, but I pretty well concluded that this would be it for me in terms of acting, and [I’ll] move towards retirement after this ’cause I’ve been doing it since I was 21. I thought, ‘Well, that’s enough.’ And why not go out with something that’s very upbeat and positive?”

Six weeks later, he had changed his mind. “I think that was a big mistake,” he told the New York Times’ Kathryn Shattuck.

Explaining his change of heart, he said, “Look, I’ve been doing this since I was 21, so that’s a long haul. You say, 'It’s time, it’s time' — not to stop, because I can’t imagine stopping at all, but just moving forward onto new territory.”

Redford is speaking to some core principles about meaning and productivity for people in later adult life. People don’t stop wanting to be productive. But they often reach a point where it’s time to go in a new direction. This can be because they’ve exhausted the rewards of the work they have been doing or because external forces impose a major change on them.

The cultural concept of retirement has inculcated the idea that there is a time in life that we no longer want to be productive and are no longer able to be productive. For many people, perhaps most, there is no time when the need and desire to be productive subsides. Being productive means looking forward, influencing, creating and doing. But how one is productive— what direction that desire takes—changes.

When asked about how he viewed his legacy, Redford replied, “Somehow when somebody says, ‘What about your legacy?’, it doesn’t register in my brain. Because I guess I’m just interested in moving forward. Legacy means looking back, and I tend to not do that.""

There’s a growing awareness that increased longevity combined with longer vitality have created a later life stage that was simply not present for previous generations. Although Redford is in his 80’s, this period of realignment usually begins for people in their early 60’s. I call it “starting older.” It requires imagining what you want to do in the world after you’ve done everything you thought of doing when you were younger.

Children are tiresomely asked, “What do you want to be when you grow up.” Well, a person who is entering the “starting older” life phase has already done that grown-up thing. Instead of retirement, people face the challenge of recreating themselves as creative, vital productive individuals. They face the question, like Redford did, of “What do I do now?”

Concepts like legacy, retirement and elderhood, which repeatedly show up in recent writing about aging, all position the older person as somehow finished and looking backward. But that’s not what it feels like to be 65 years old. The idea of wrapping up a life of accomplishment, whatever it may have been, lacks appeal for many in their 60’s and 70’s.

Redford is an independent creator who is free to do what he wants without significantly impacting others. But in many arenas of work, the decisions made by a 65-year-old deeply affect the future of younger generations and health of the business itself. The underlying human need to continue to feel productive and engaged in the world is universal. Specific dynamics and traditions vary somewhat from industry to industry.

Family business advisors are beginning to grapple with the problem of succession in the context of increasing longevity. If a family business leader doesn’t step aside at sixty-five or so, what happens to the 40-year-olds who are waiting for a chance to lead? The solution cannot be to accept the fact that there will be a generation of content Prince Charles types waiting patiently, at age seventy, for a turn to lead. Rather, the idea of meaningful next phases of productivity for those starting older has to be inculcated in family business planning.

Law firms have traditionally nudged their partners out at age 65. In fact, mandatory retirement around sixty-five is only beginning to be phased out in the legal profession. This policy has the advantage of ensuring that a younger generation gets a chance to lead. But law firms have been less adept in helping their senior people pivot in a way that satisfies a partner’s personal needs for purpose and productivity. Volunteerism, travel and all the time you could possibly want to play golf simply can’t provide the sense of purpose, satisfaction and engagement that these highly productive people need.

For most people, the answer is not to keep doing more of the same. A sense of accomplishment diminishes when you’ve achieved everything you meant to or have done everything you can think of doing in a particular arena. And when an older generation hangs on, it thwarts the growth of the next generations and leads to dissatisfaction for all.

People who are “starting older” need to rethink their purpose and preferred means of productivity. They need some years to do this. They need to make sure they are making space for younger leaders and producers. They need to take advantage of the freedom to do something new, something different, something creative, something challenging. But they should not be encouraged to think of themselves as leaving behind productivity and engagement.

What we need is a major cultural shift and an ongoing conversation about new changes in the life cycle, rethinking what it means for a person to have 15-20 years of reasonably good health and a need to be productive ahead when they've reached the apex of your career. Like Robert Redford, we need to ditch the ideas of retirement and legacy and think about new directions and paradigms for how we live the later stages of our lives.",
"It's the most wonderful time of the year. We are all focused on our end-of-the-year review, tiny raise (if any), bonus (maybe) and the slight chance for a promotion. We also think a little about the holidays and spending time with family and friends.

As if you are not stressed enough over the holiday season, choosing the right presents for loved ones, prudently balancing work and social engagements and risking your life by precariously climbing a 20-foot ladder to decorate the outside of your home with lights, you also have to contend with a year-end review with your Grinch of a boss. Before you are herded into the boss or human resource person’s office to discuss your performance, I have a smart suggestion for you. Are you up to trying something that could be a little unique and different?  This action will definitely push you out of your comfort zone. Before you go into the end-of- the-year review or embark upon a job search,  you can try this strategy.

We all view ourselves in a certain light. Sometimes we are considerably more critical of ourselves than necessary. Other times, we give ourselves far more credit than we deserve. Our own self perception may not be very accurate. We cannot trust ourselves to be clear thinking and unbiased when it comes to rating ourselves. To ensure a fair and honest appraisal of how you are viewed in the workplace, it makes sense to ask people that you work with how they perceive you.

Think of this as your own 360-degree job assessment made by your peers. First, pick about six people who you have a relationship with. Ask them to give you an honest evaluation of how they view your work. It would be helpful to choose people from different facets of your work life. For instance, you could select a peer, a senior-level person from a division that you interface with, a subordinate and a former colleague.

Once you have picked out your team of independent advisers, politely ask if they can spare 10-30 minutes to talk candidly. The conversation could be held in the office, at a Starbucks for coffee, sitting down for lunch or over a beer. Let them know that you will be having your year-end review and would appreciate some honest feedback on your work, so that you will be better prepared for this meeting. Let them know that you desire a second opinion on your work product; ask about how you interact with people and the manner in which you are viewed within the organization.

I recognize that this is not easy. Don’t be afraid of criticism. In fact, ask for tough answers, tell them not to pull any punches and invite brutally honest constructive criticism. You can start with a few questions.

“What do people in the office think of my performance?”

“How is my attitude and demeanor?”

“Am I viewed as being effective, efficient and professional?”

“Do I work well and play well with others?”

“Are there things that I could do differently to have a greater impact?”

“Would you recommend me for a promotion or hire me if you had the chance?”

“What would you rate me on a scale of 1-10?”

“How do I compare with my peers?”

“Do you believe that I have what it takes to move into upper management?”

“Is there anything I should know concerning what people say about me when I’m not around?”

These are just some sample questions to get started. Then, you could hold a more free-flowing, unstructured conversation.

With this knowledge, you will have a better understanding of how you are viewed in the office and could use this information in your meeting with your supervisor—or in a search for a new job. You should be mentally prepared that the feedback may be disappointingly and surprisingly eye opening. You will need to work on improving yourself before expecting a good evaluation. Also, you could factor this information into your decision-making process before you start looking for a new job.

Hopefully, if the collective opinions of this group are overwhelmingly positive, it will give you the confidence to share all of the positive and wonderful things that people say and think about you and empower you to push hard for a raise, higher bonus or promotion.",
"Sooner or later, it will be your turn to interview for your next job.

When you do, here are the 10 most popular interview questions -- and how to answer them.

You will likely interview with multiple professionals, share your work and educational experiences, discuss other aspects of your background, and learn more about the prospective job and the employer.

Although each interview is unique and you may receive different questions, and whether you interview at Google or your local small business, here are 10 common interview questions that you should expect:

It sounds like an easy question, but this is not another reason to recite your LinkedIn profile.

Rather than listing the what, focus on the why: why you chose certain jobs, why you have a gap on your resume, why you went skiing in Aspen for a year after college.

The interviewers already read your resume. Now, help them understand how everything fits together.

This is your opportunity to give your elevator pitch of why you made certain decisions.

Oh, where to start? You're amazing. You're a superstar. You've got this.

Here's the thing: your interviewer may not know that.

Yes, they've read your resume, but who is the three-dimensional you?

This should be an easy question. Focus on the why behind the what. Rather than list your accomplishments, provide examples in a clear and concise response.

Weaknesses? What weaknesses? This may be one of the least favorite interview questions.

In balancing the ying and yang of the interview, you're bound to get this question.

Like your interviewer, and everyone else, you have weaknesses. The important part is not necessarily what those weaknesses are, but how self-aware and genuine you are. Be transparent.

Show your excitement for the job and the company. You've done your homework - now, share it.

Demonstrate how you are a great fit, and connect how your experiences can add value.

This part of an interview is basically the interviewer asking you to convince them. It's your elevator pitch. Imagine you're on an episode of Shark Tank. (Except Mr. Wonderful can't object to your entire business model).

This is about tying everything together - your background, experiences, skills and more - and how it will enhance and create value for the company, customers, shareholders and employees.

No matter your job, everyone faces challenges at work. It could be difficult co-workers, a poor work environment, a bad boss, a challenging client.

Of all the challenges - and you may have experienced all of the above - give one example of how you overcame adversity at work.

Interviewers want to see how you have dealt with friction and uncomfortable situations, and whether you can handle them appropriately.

This is one of the most important questions an interviewer can ask. Companies who are focused on hiring and retaining leaders should always ask this question.

It's critical because your leadership style, skills and abilities will have a major impact on the future of the company. Leadership matters, and too many companies overlook this essential skill.

Share the what, but also explain the why. What drives you as a leader? How have your bosses led you in the past? How have you led others? What role do you play on teams? Think of your best and worst bosses when answering this question.

If you plan to stay at the company and work your way up the ranks, then say so.

If you plan to leave in a few years after gaining experience and launch your own business, then say so.

It's important to be transparent so that expectations are set.

You may not know what you want, which is ok to say as well.

Too many people are quick to answer that they want to spend the next 30 years working at the company. If that's true, wonderful. Otherwise, be direct and open with your interviewer. They should appreciate your candor.

This question is similar to the leadership skills question.

For this question, focus not only on the leadership experience, but also what you learned from the experience that made you a better leader.

The outcome of the leadership experience doesn't have to be positive. You may have led a team down the wrong path. If so, share the experience. The point of the question is not what an amazing leader you are. It's what you learned from the experience to become better.

Your interviewer cares about the leader you are today and the leader you can grow to be, not the leader you were three years ago.

After being questioned repeatedly, now it's your turn.

This is your opportunity to learn more about the company, your interviewer, the role, the team, your manager, and the company's strategy and growth trajectory.

And remember, you're probably more prepared for this interview than you think.",
"“To earn trust, money and power aren’t enough; you have to show some concern for others. You can’t buy trust in the supermarket."" – His Holiness the Dalai Lama

There are just a few elemental forces that hold our world together. The one that’s the glue of society is called trust. Its presence cements relationships by allowing people to live and work together, feel safe and belong to a group. Trust in a leader allows organizations and communities to flourish, while the absence of trust can cause fragmentation, conflict and even war. That’s why we need to trust our leaders, our family members, our friends and our co-workers, albeit in different ways.

Trust is hard to define, but we do know when it’s lost. When that happens, we withdraw our energy and level of engagement. We go on an internal strike, not wanting to be sympathetic to the person who we feel has hurt us or treated us wrongly. We may not show it outwardly, but we are less likely to tell the formerly trusted person that we are upset, to share what is important to us or to follow through on commitments. As a result, we pull back from that person and no longer feel part of their world. This loss of trust can be obvious or somewhat hidden — especially if we pretend to be present but inwardly disengage. And those who have done something to lose our trust may not even know it.

On the positive side, trust makes people feel eager to be part of a relationship or group, with a shared purpose and a willingness to depend on each other. When trust is intact, we will willingly contribute what is needed, not just by offering our presence, but also by sharing our dedication, talent, energy and honest thoughts on how the relationship or group is working.

One dictionary definition of trust is “feeling safe when vulnerable.” When we depend on a leader, family member or friend, we can feel vulnerable, and we need trust to manage the anxiety of this feeling. When trust is present, things go well; but when trust is lost, the relationship is at risk.

If the level of trust is low in a relationship or organization, people limit their involvement and what they are willing to do or share. They might think to themselves, “This is all you deserve,” or, “This is as all I am willing to give.” In contrast, when the trust level is high, people reward it by giving more. But, more often than not, people feel that their distrust is not safe to share. So a leader or loved one may be slow to discover that they have lost a person’s trust.

The hiddenness and personal nature of trust can be a problem for relationships, teams or organizations. How can you fix something that is not expressed or shared? How do you even know that trust is lost? Paradoxically, there must be at least a little trust in order to discuss its lack and make attempts to rebuild it, while if the loss of trust remains unaddressed, the relationship will grow more and more distant.

Trust is often related to leadership and power, but it is not a given. To be effective, a leader must earn the trust of his or her constituents to ensure their participation and allegiance. Indeed, any successful relationship — whether it’s leader to follower, consultant or coach to client or the relationship between spouses, siblings and friends — relies on a level of trust that must be earned. Yet even trust that is earned can be quickly lost and cannot be quickly regained. If members of a team or relationship lose trust in each other, it takes a great deal of work to restore it. People are not quick to reinvest in a relationship where trust has been broken. They generally move on.

Since trust is so important in both working and personal relationships, how can we monitor it, build upon it and heal it when it becomes frayed? It is useful to view trust as a natural response to certain qualities in a person, group or organization, and the absence of these qualities will diminish the level of trust. These qualities are:

All of these qualities contribute to the degree of trust people have for each other. If you are feeling a shift of trust in a relationship, it is helpful to assess the presence or absence of each of these six qualities. This allows you to discover what is lacking in the relationship and find ways to restore trust. To build or rebuild trust, a leader must open the conversation about the degree to which each of the six qualities are present and be open to hearing what others feel, observe and need. Of course, the leader will need some trust in the others in order to begin this process.

Similarly, it takes courage in a family or personal relationship to bring up loss of trust and to request that another person modify their behavior. This may lead to learning that you need to look at your own behavior too. Trust is a two-way street, built by the behavior of each person in the relationship.

Trust is often lost when we feel hurt by another’s action and believe that this action (or inaction) was intentional. But by sharing our feelings with the person who hurt us, we might begin to see things differently and realize that their intention was not what we imagined. This may repair the breach quickly as misunderstandings are unraveled and communication deepens. It may be difficult to initiate such a conversation; however, given the tendency to withdraw when we feel hurt. Still, a person who is able to do this will find that they are less frequently hurt.

In the same way, if we feel that we have done something to lose the trust of another, we can seek the other out and inquire about what has happened. True, this can feel awkward and risky — especially if one is a leader, parent or person of authority — and this is not something that comes naturally. But this willingness to be vulnerable can ultimately lead to greater trust because the other person feels that their own vulnerability and needs are being respected.

The dynamics of trust are delicate in important relationships, and the loss of trust can be costly — not only psychologically, but also financially and in terms or work and livelihood. What’s helpful to remember is that trust is an ongoing exchange between people and is not static. Trust can be earned. It can be lost. And it can be regained.",
"Should companies like Nike or Levi's take a stand on social issues even as they sell to consumers of different backgrounds and beliefs and may risk alienating those who don’t agree with their position? The answer is yes, according to a new study.

About 62% of consumers worldwide want companies to take a stand on the social, cultural, environmental and political issues that they care about, with nearly two-thirds saying their buying decisions are affected by the words, values or actions of companies’ leaders, according to a survey of nearly 30,000 consumers by Accenture Strategy.

In a sign that the issue is top of mind for global business leaders, this is the first time in Accenture’s 14th annual Global Consumer Pulse Research survey that purpose-related questions were incorporated, an Accenture spokeswoman said, adding that the company's clients want to understand the link between profit and purpose and how brand positioning can make them more competitive.

Echoing other reports, the study, released Wednesday, found that the trend is being driven by millennials and Gen Z: 60% of the combined group, a key demographic target for brands, believe it’s important for companies to take a stand on issues including human rights, race relations or LGBT equality. That compares with 50% of Gen Xers and Baby Boomers, according to the study.

Companies are taking those cues to heart. Nike’s September signing of former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick to an endorsement contract, and its casting of Kaepernick for the 30th anniversary of its ""Just Do It"" Campaign, is one notable example, as is outdoor clothing retailer Patagonia’s October endorsement of two U.S. Senate candidates for the first time in its history. U.K. retailer John Lewis has reportedly removed boys' and girls' labels from its children’s clothing to be gender neutral while Swedish furniture seller IKEA has begun to employ Syrian refugees at its production facility in Jordan.

Back in the U.S., Levi’s president and CEO Chip Bergh has been outspoken against gun violence, among other issues, and has written an open letter asking gun owners not to bring firearms into the company's stores, offices or facilities.

“While not everyone agreed with our decision, we stood firm because we have never been afraid to take an unpopular stand to support a greater good,” Levi’s said in a company blog post.

Even though there’s no study quantifying the precise business impact from companies' taking a stand on controversial topics, some studies offer some proof that the pros of standing behind what a company believes in outweigh the potential risks of losing some shoppers.

For instance, although some consumers burned and threatened to boycott Nike products in protest of the company's signing of Kaepernick, online sales of Nike-branded items jumped 32%, 6.4 percentage points above the average industry growth rate, in the 27 days following the Kaepernick campaign in the apparel, shoes, accessories and sports and outdoors categories, according to a study of online receipts by Rakuten Intelligence, which has a panel of 5.5 million online U.S. shoppers. The study, released in November, found ""politically conscious moves help brands increase sales."" Younger and more affluent buyers support “socially conscious brands” and have “affinity” for brands like Nike and Patagonia, the study said.

For its part, Levi's in October reported its fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth, which Bergh said at the time put it among the top performers in the industry.

“Companies that don’t step up pay the price,” said the Accenture study, titled ""From Me to We: The Rise of the Purpose-led Brand."" “Consumers who are disappointed with a brand’s words or actions on a social issue complain about it. That’s not surprising. What’s different now is that 47% walk away in frustration, with 17% not coming back. Ever.”

"In career development and the world of work, I’m often struck by the emphasis on income as the measure of success. Yet, paradoxically, sharing openly about income is taboo. We usually infer salary from a certain type of job (“He’s a high-paid lawyer”) or drop hints (“I make a comfortable living”) about income.

The hope of many parents is that their children will land high-earning jobs as doctors, engineers, lawyers and, increasingly, IT professionals. We can’t blame parents for wanting their children to be financially secure. But as exposed by the 2008 Great Recession and the resulting high unemployment rate, even high-income jobs can be lost when forces beyond our control are at play.

Growing up, my father worked hard to support his family. He was from a working-class background, only completing the eighth grade, then went on to trade school to learn to be a pressman (as in letterpress printing, something you can only now find in your local museum or artisan shop, where the work is viewed as a lost art). My mother was not typical of her time. Though she managed the household and my sister and me, she was also my dad’s partner in his work, handling the financial end of the business and taking on a range of part-time jobs. She sold holiday cards and wedding invitations, typed assignments, and drove a school bus. Today, she would be a quintessential “gig” worker.

My parents wanted us to have careers that would support us financially and always be in demand. My sister became a successful hairstylist. I went to law school and started a practice. I can’t say though that I made a “killing” practicing law -- I suppose I gave too many breaks to folks I felt were in need.

Looking back on working for over 30 years, I’ve come to realize that making the primary object of a career generating a substantial income was not the best fit for me. And I suspect I may not be alone. Of course, making money is important, but “making good” as a career goal can be important and bring significant meaning to one’s life, sometimes more so than income.

There are many pathways to career fulfillment. A few occupations that are designed for those looking for meaning and contributing to the social good come to mind: teachers, police officers, firefighters and even the military. As a society, we are gradually coming to recognize that careers aimed at serving higher purposes must be recognized through appropriate remuneration. But teachers are still underpaid, and the level of service pay to enlisted men and women is often criticized as too low.

Authors Emily Esfahani Smith in The Power of Meaning: Crafting a Life That Matters and Daniel Pink in Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us note the growing recognition that meaning and purpose are critical in careers today. Books like Compassionate Careers: Making a Living by Making a Difference by Jeffrey Pryor and Alexandra Mitchell and job search sites like Idealist.org provide alternative pathways for those who want to make a difference in the world.

Those who study millennials and now Gen Zers are finding that they desire to make an impact on society and create change whether it is by improving social conditions, saving the environment or seeking equality between genders, races and people of different sexual orientations. We should challenge ourselves (particularly as parents) to get young people to seek careers that not only support themselves financially but are meaningful and advance social and global change. I have a bias of course: I’d like to know that we will have a future generation of teachers and police educating our youth and keeping us safe, who can make a good living and find meaning in their work.",
"With so much fundamental change in the workplace today, having a growth mindset is a critical skill for leaders. The concept, which has gained widespread recognition over the last 20 years, is founded on Carol Dweck’s research and refers to the belief that basic personal abilities, such as intelligence and talent, can be improved and developed through hard work and focus. This contrasts with a fixed mindset: the belief that one is born with fixed abilities that cannot be changed very much.

In a world that is constantly and rapidly evolving, leaders need to demonstrate an ability to adapt and develop ahead of the curve. This requires growth-oriented behaviors, like flexibility, curiosity, openness, perspective taking, iterative thinking, the ability to receive and understand data (feedback) of all kinds and enough humility to respond.

The problem is that while this concept resonates with most leaders on a conceptual and intellectual level, it's hard to understand what it actually means in terms of transforming behavior. The tendency is to approach the issue on a macro level -- the organization, the system and corporate culture. However, at its core, mindset change happens on a micro level -- in individual habits, adjustments and contributions. These micro efforts become scalable because the effects of changed personal behavior are contagious and will ripple out.

What leaders often miss is that to develop a growth mindset, they actually need to work on themselves. It requires a great amount of confidence and humility to become what Satya Nadella of Microsoft calls a “learn-it-all” rather than “know-it-all.” In fact, this is a shift from the traditional view of a leader being the expert or the most knowledgeable person in the room to one in which the leader is the person who has to draw out, inspire and motivate the experts, the holders of knowledge.

If leaders do not recognize that growth mindset starts with them, we will continue to see a proliferation of “growth” jargon and hype throughout organizations, but with very little change in action, approaches or ways of working together. This reduces a potentially game-changing asset into inflated lip service. As the old adage tells us, actions really do speak louder than words.

So how can you, as a leader, further develop your growth mindset?

When leaders normalize a thirst for input, feedback and guidance from multiple sources, it signals that the focus is on learning and growing (versus judging or being judged) and on valuing diversity (not just relying on the usual “experts”). It’s a way of recognizing that you, as a boss, don’t know everything and are happy to learn and grow.

Most importantly, for organizations that are hungry to create innovation, it creates a culture of psychological safety, where feedback is eagerly solicited and people don’t need to be defensive about their mistakes.

Growth and resilience are closely correlated. Showing that you can handle failure or negative feedback and that you believe it plays a critical role in personal development helps others see the connection.

• Practice the pause and get context.

Before speaking, reacting, judging or advising, pause just for a few seconds to look around you. Many leaders are so focused on driving projects forward that they develop tunnel vision and don’t zoom out to get a higher-level perspective.

Situational awareness goes a long way in ensuring you are really optimizing your options and potential. It requires discipline and wisdom to intentionally step back and take a deeper, more contextual look at all the other factors, even those that are weaker. This type of deep thinking allows for better clarity and provides an opportunity to model how to process and react without fear of making decisions in ambiguous or changing situations.

• Intentionally seek out perspectives, ideas, people and skills that are not your own.

As we all know, groupthink can be a big roadblock to innovation and growth. Actively cultivating diversity through encouraging alternative perspectives, giving airtime to opposing viewpoints and playing devil’s advocate are just a few ways to build openness in yourself as well as promote cognitive diversity in the organization. It’s virtually impossible to eliminate individual biases, but we certainly can mitigate its effects by taking it out of the process, ensuring that openness pervades the entire organization.

Cultivating a growth mindset and ultimately benefitting from a growth mindset means that leaders need to personally own the fact that they may not know everything and that the more they can grow, adapt and change personally, the better they can help their organizations grow.",
"Smart leaders know that each employee on their team is unique, and those leaders become adept at communicating with and leading each team member in the most effective way. However, there are some leadership basics — particularly around setting expectations — that every manager should follow, such as clearly defining goals and offering the right resources to help your team thrive.

With this in mind, we asked a panel of Forbes Coaches Council members about the “right” ways to set expectations with your employees — and why doing things differently might damage your team dynamic and hamper progress. Follow their advice to get the best out of your workers.

Clear communication is key, but more importantly, an effective leader communicates early and often. If you ever hear yourself saying, “Well, it should be obvious” — that's the time to proactively communicate your expectations. Empower your team to make decisions, but don't leave them guessing. There are enough challenges already without adding ambiguity into the mix. - Tonya Echols, Thrive Coaching Solutions

Setting expectations should be a conversation, not a dictation. The right way is to sit down with your employees, discuss everyone’s needs and expectations, and come to a collective, democratic solution. Your idea of a reasonable timeline may not be anyone else’s. You are the leader, so you can push back a bit, but railroading is not effective and causes resentment and distrust. - Frances McIntosh, Intentional Coaching LLC

3. Focus On The ‘What,’ Not The ‘How’

As managers, we can get attached to “how” to best meet expectations. But a more inspiring approach for employees is to focus on “what” your desired outcome or vision is. Focusing on the “what” allows employees to feel more invested in the process toward completion. Plus, they might uncover a better way. If you focus on the “how,” employees can feel stifled and demotivated. - Rosie Guagliardo, InnerBrilliance Coaching

4. Ask Them For Their Expectations Of You, Too

Expectations go both ways. Start your conversation by identifying the outcome you want to create for you and your employees by identifying expectations. Let them know that you’d like to hear their expectations of you. Begin by stating your expectations and how they will contribute to your desired outcome, then invite them to share their expectations and how they’ll impact those same outcomes. - Jenn Lofgren, Incito Executive & Leadership Development

5. Clarify Your Thoughts First, Then Communicate Them Simply

Sometimes you may not be sure what your expectations are because you did not take the time to clarify your thoughts. Or you may know what you want, but you communicate it ineffectively because you do not want to sound too directive. Get clear on your expectations and communicate them simply. Then, check for understanding. Your employees need to understand your expectations to meet them. - Caterina Kostoula, The Leaderpath

There are foundational expectations that apply to everyone and everything. Those are your core values, and they need to be set clearly and early. Then there are personal expectations that are unique to the employee. They need to be set in partnership with the employee and in a way that meets their growth and goals. That way the employee owns the expectations and builds upon them. - Tony Mickle, Big Box Coaching

7. Know That With Clarity Comes Focus

The most productive way to set expectations with your employees is to be clear and specific. Ask clarification questions, check for understanding and encourage an open and honest discussion. This will build buy-in, and the employee will be relaxed as they know what’s expected. When employees know what’s expected, they don’t waste time or energy worrying. Instead, they maximize their time and skills. - Nadidah Coveney, CTM Consulting Group LLC

Setting expectations is successful when employees feel connected, empowered and inspired to perform at their peak. It’s not successful when they feel directed, forced and unhappy. Therefore, the right way is to engage them with the organizational mission, priorities and goals — the common ground — and get their feedback and support for the “what” and the “how” to achieve those. - Amy Nguyen, Happiness Infinity LLC

9. Ask How Employees Will Hold Themselves Accountable

Setting expectations requires an understanding of responsibility and accountability. First, help your employee understand how their responsibility/work aligns to the goal or objective. This provides a sense of ownership for them. Second, ask them how they will hold themselves accountable. Make sure to clearly define what success would look like for that work. - Alan Trivedi, MBA PCC, Trivedi Coaching & Consulting Group

Setting expectations is easy when they are S.M.A.R.T. — Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic and Time-Based. Ensure employees know why the goals are in place and what happens when they are or are not met. Keep those goals consistent with the company mission and you have a recipe for success. Unclear communication is the shortest path to failure. - Krystal Yates, EBR Consulting LLC

11. Make Sure Teams Have What They Need To Be Successful

You cannot delegate accountability. Your teams need to accept it. The best way to do that is to set clear expectations of the outcomes you are looking for and to ask if they have everything they need to be successful. When they say yes, then they have understood and agreed to take accountability to meet those expectations. Teams expect leaders to put them in a position where they can be successful. - Gordon Tredgold, Leadership Principles LLC",communication
"As a financial life planner running my own firm, I take the holidays as my signal to pause, take a breath and reflect on the year, celebrating successes and learning from challenges.

From personal experience, I'll tell you it's impossible to give this the proper attention sitting at your desk on a hectic workday afternoon. In order to have the most impactful outcome, give yourself the time, the space and the mindset to eliminate day-to-day distractions and get in touch with your thoughts.

Once I've cleared the decks, the first thing I do is ask myself a series of questions related to the important people in my life -- family, friends, clients, colleagues and extended teammates.

The answers serve as my guide as I work to help make the holidays meaningful for the important people in my life and to shed light on anything that might otherwise fester and taint the New Year.

I suggest creating special holiday moments where you as a servant leader give to your clients/customers and colleagues your time, genuine care, and concern. Draw from your 'inside' time to know what is needed for each person in your circle.

For example, at my firm, Financial Life Focus, we host an annual lunch where all employees contribute something to the table. We spend the afternoon sharing, celebrating, and acknowledging the good stuff, accomplishments, and the challenges (both personal and professional) we faced during the year. And believe me, we've had the challenges (death, divorce, illness) as well as the joys (children, adventures, and new experiences).

This is important to do with people in your extended circle who add value to your business throughout the year. Take our firm's technology consultant -- our conversation to review tech needs for next year begins with me expressing gratitude for his expertise and then shifts to a check in of his highlights. I discover what he's most proud of and what his meaningful experiences included during the year.

I am also interested in his perspective as a fellow business owner on how he navigates challenges. The end of our discussion centers around how my expertise can help him. The exchange is a two-way gift. He feels appreciated, heard, and that our relationship has mutual value. It isn't just about fixing our machines and keeping our software and systems working -- he's an integral part of the firm and our success.

A word of caution: In the process of sharing, you might be tempted to offer advice. Resist! You're there to listen deeply and be there for the other person; not to be counselor, therapist or advice giver. If you're specifically asked for counsel, then be sure to take the time to consider the situation and schedule a time to get back with them. This shows authentic concern by not shooting from the hip.

Asking questions and letting others pilot a course to do something interesting, different, or meaningful is the ultimate reward. What would bring them joy? What would make a difference? And for the people on your corporate gift list, these conversations will help you understand what they truly value.

By approaching the holiday this way, you are actually promoting the next conversation, which is about the future. How do we move forward, what should we be doing better, and how and what will bring us all more success?",
"Ever get to the end of your day and find that you're just no longer able to deal?

You might think this is because you're just exhausted or over it or hearing the call of happy hour, but it could really be that your body releases less of the hormones that help you respond to stress in the evenings.

New research from Hokkaido University in Japan finds that when stress hits in the morning, the body delivers an extra jolt of the stress hormone cortisol to the system. However, when study participants were faced with the exact same type of stressful situation (giving a presentation and doing some mental calculations) in the evening, the body did not get the same cortisol-based boost of energy to face the challenge.

Yamanaka and his colleagues conducted a study involving 27 volunteers and measured their cortisol levels in response to stressful situations at different times of day. The results are published in the journal Neuropsychopharmacology Reports.

You are already primed to deal with stress better in the morning, as the brain's master circadian clock that regulates hormone levels makes sure cortisol levels are typically higher at the start of the day.

The body has other ways of addressing stress, namely the sympathetic nervous system, and the researchers found that system does not vary in how it responds to stressors in the morning versus the evening.

But if you've got some unpleasant business or a high pressure situation you need to deal with, probably best to schedule it before lunch if you can.

There is, of course, the all-important caveat that results may vary. Or, as Yamanaka puts it:

""It is important to take into account each individual's unique biological clock and the time of day when assessing the response to stressors and preventing them.""

Fair enough, but I still prefer to get the worst bits of the day over with first thing. You can decide for yourself what it means that I wrote this all in the evening.",

"As another year comes to a close, I find myself reflecting on, of course, the last year of running my own  startup, but also on the seven years before that. I'm often asked how it feels to be running this company, now eight years in. Don't get me wrong--I love what I do. But in today's day and age of getting a new job every 18 months to two years, it's hard to believe I've been at Kiip this long.

The new year is also a time for recharging and refreshing; trying new strategies and tactics to bring your company success. But even as goals change and our company changes, there are four main lessons I've learned that I try to hold onto. Keeping this advice in mind has allowed Kiip to continue growing and evolving, and can do the same for any startup or business.

Time moves so fast that a lot of things that are part of our daily lives feel like they sort of just, showed up here. It's difficult to remember what the world was like before Google, or before Twitter. But the myth of overnight success is just that: a myth.

Quora was founded in 2009. Twitch, the streaming company, started at JustinTV in 2007. You need multiple cycles in the market to test if your product needs stand the test of time. You've got to be in it for the long haul, and be dedicated to outlasting your competition. This involves always staying on top of what your competition is doing, and studying how your consumers are behaving and evolving, so that you can give them what they want before they know they want it. If you can patiently work toward that, your time will come.

Being a CEO is one thing. But being a CEO and a founder is another thing entirely. As a founder, you will probably have a different level of investment in your company's success. To work toward that success, remember the key tenets of foundership:

If you're running into trouble, try coming back to these, and see which one is being disrupted, so you can tackle the problem appropriately.

There's a toxic glorification of being ""aggressive"" in startup culture, and tech in general. The toxicity comes from equating being ""aggressive"" with being mean, which has never been and will never be the answer.

Everything comes back around. In eight years, I've seen old colleagues start billion dollar companies, and have even seen former customers become Chief Marketing Officers. Old employees leave and come back. It's not worth being mean to people; they will remember.

There Is Life Beyond Your Startup

News of HQ and Vine founder Colin Kroll's death hit home, and rightfully so. Silicon Valley and VC culture perpetuate the myth of ""grow or die."" Sure, you can become a billion dollar company, and you should always aim high, but life is larger than that. No company is worth your mental and physical well-being.

Afford this to others, too; when people used to leave Kiip, I would take the hit personally. It felt like losing a limb, and that was very unhealthy. Know that people are not leaving you, they're looking out for themselves, just like we all should be.",
"Recently, I’ve had a few career coaching clients ask me some variation of, ""How can I trust myself? I've taken steps in my career that I thought were the right thing and now things aren’t working out. So, how can I trust my judgment in deciding what I do next?”

My answer is we can trust ourselves and our judgment to the extent that we’re willing to be really honest with ourselves.

The thing is, you can never know for sure how something is going to go, we’re just working with the information we have in the moment. However - and this is where we can run into trouble - often we don’t really use all the information available to us. In particular, we don't look at or we downplay how we’re actually feeling deep down about things. What’s going on inside of us is a wealth of information we can have the tendency to ignore, sometimes knowingly.

So how do you trust yourself in deciding on your next career step? You make sure you’re looking at that stuff going on inside. I’m talking about getting really honest about the potential thing you’re considering doing and whether you genuinely feel it’s what you want. Just how in a relationship with another person, you can trust them to the extent they are honest with you, you can only really trust yourself to the extent you are honest with yourself.

For me in the past, just like my clients, I also made decisions I thought were the “right” move, but they didn’t work out as I’d hoped. What I was doing was actively convincing myself - telling myself a story about how it was the right thing and hiding what I knew deep down to be true. I was pretending that there wasn’t a small voice inside me whispering, “Actually no, you don’t really want to do this.” I didn’t want to acknowledge it and was scared to admit it was there. Because then I would have to deal with it.

Our truth can often seem pretty inconvenient and troublesome; so we’d rather pretend it’s not there.  For me, facing my truth would mean I’d have to then do the work of finding what I actually do want to do. At the time I felt lost and like I hadn’t a clue what that was. But I did know it was likely something that didn’t fit the script of what myself and others had created for my future. I was afraid to be honest about and confront that. So I pushed that inner voice aside and tried my best to convince myself the path I was about to walk was the “right” one and that I actually wanted it.

I think you know how that worked out. We can’t hide from ourselves. There’s no getting around your truth. In this moment, your truth could be that despite all the arguments for it, you don’t actually want to do what you’re considering doing next. Your truth could be that you don’t really know what you want to do, but instead of doing the inner work to find out, you’re trying to convince yourself you want to do X - you’re not being honest with yourself. Whatever your honest truth is, it’s what you can trust. And it’s perhaps the most valuable piece of information to guide your next step. Any step that honors that truth will put you on solid ground.

So, how do you know if you’re being honest with yourself? Well, if what you’re considering doing is right for you, you likely won't need to convince yourself. You’ll know. You’ll feel it. And while you may have fear, you’ll also feel excited to take this next step because there’s some real desire there. It’s not coming from shoulds or a convincing mind with arguments. Notice the difference between something sounding good - maybe looking really good on paper, feeding your ego, ticking all the boxes, having arguments for being a “safe” choice - vs. something that actually in your bones feels good, gets you excited and has some real energy behind it.  Get clear and honest with yourself on your motivations - are you motivated by a genuine desire to do what you’re considering doing? Or is it coming from a place of shoulds and a need for external validation?

Think about other areas of life, like relationships. Have you ever started a relationship with someone and early on had some red flags that you chose to ignore? Perhaps you did a bunch of convincing yourself that they weren’t a big deal. Maybe because you were afraid of being alone, facing the judgment of others, bearing the pain of ending the relationship, or any number of other reasons. In the end, these relationships usually don’t work out and you’re left wondering why when deep down you kinda already know why. You knew all along it wasn't really the right fit. What I’m talking about here for your career navigation is a very similar thing.

Pay attention to how you’re really feeling. If you do that, you can take your next career step knowing you’re doing the best you can and it’s likely your future self will thank you. There are still no guarantees things will go exactly as you hope, but you will have done your part.",
"The H Hub is pioneering a new system of decentralized content creation with their community-driven content engine -- replacing influencer marketing in the process.

Influencer marketing has been heralded as the ""Next Big Thing"" in marketing; in 2015, brands spent $1B on sponsored posts on social media. In 2016, that number jumped to $2B, then $4B in 2017, and it’s projected to double again to $8B by this year’s close.

Many see this as evidence that the burgeoning marketing category is booming, but according to James Cole, the founder of The H Hub, it’s proof of the exact opposite; influencer marketing has already sealed its own doom.

“Brands are drawn to influencer marketing because it leverages an existing relationship between follower and influencer,” Cole said in an interview with the author. “It’s a media buy with an implicit endorsement.”

Influencer marketing has found success over the past few years because it taps this ecosystem built on trust. Influencers generate followings through ""authentic"" content. This situates them with a marketer’s most desirable commodity: consumer attention. The surge in spend on influencer marketing can be attributed to brands and agencies increasingly turning to influencers for this type of high-engagement, authentic reach that’s unavailable through traditional channels. According to Cole, though, as spend has increased, the quality of content has vastly diluted -- and in a few short years turned influencer marketing into a “skyscraper on soft ground”:

This race to the bottom is exacerbated by an influx of influencer marketing agencies designed to matchmake influencers and brands. According to Cole, these companies often similarly prize speed over quality; prioritizing any match over the appropriate match. In this model, a travel influencer might endorse a watch; a mommy blogger, hair vitamins. This could be a contributing factor to recent Linqia findings that even though the number of branded posts has tripled since 2017, the number of “likes” on those posts has remained constant.

Enter: The H Hub. Cole sees H as a new breed of dot-connector, one that emphasizes community, creativity, and decentralization to take the good aspects of influencer marketing -- quality content and quality relationships -- and rebuild them into a powerful ecosystem where all parties benefit. The “H” is intended to represent the shape connecting creators to brands (i.e. |-|).

H has been in operation since 2016, but Cole has used that time to focus on building a community specifically comprised of content creators (not influencers) before offering access to brands and agencies via a marketplace. In those two years, the H Hub has become a place where creatives of many different backgrounds can find like-minded collaborators as well as discover what aspects of their work are resonating with audiences and peers. And the results speak for themselves. In that time, The H Hub has formed into a curated, connected community, with nearly 40,000 members across the country -- while maintaining a selectivity rate of 30%.

“Though we present like a database, we function more like a creative roster,” Cole said. “We know and have relationships with our entire roster. We have hosted over 500 events, and 186,000 collaborative (non-paid) shoots happened between our creators last year alone.”

The platform will remain free for creators, with a recently launched brand/agency portal starting at $2,000 per month.

“Now, we are opening up our community to brands and agencies that need our help,” Cole said. “Brands and agencies use The Hub as a content engine – a tool to find the best creators, to create the best branded content, in seconds.”

Though the approach is novel in the current climate, Cole explained that it’s a strategy rooted in the early days of the media structure we currently take for granted.

“In the early 1900s, ad agencies were creative shops and media buyers; that is, they would create the ads and place them into newspapers,” Cole said. “Recently, creative and media have separated – different businesses with different specialties. Influencer marketing, if done correctly, is an opportunity to re-merge the two and ‘flatten the ad stack’ again.”

This is where The Hub really separates itself: how it supports its community -- both as individuals and a collective.

At the individual level, creators on The Hub are equipped with robust data about their content and audience. They can see what type of content drives the highest engagement – including the most relevant brands to their creative output.

By empowering creators with these metrics, rather than sharing them only with brands, The Hub emphasizes quality over quantity. For example, a newcomer photographer with a specific niche is now more empowered to make the case to related brands that her style is better for engagement than a more general-interest photographer with a higher follower count.

On a community level, the Hub empowers it’s creators by encouraging them to connect (and create) with each other. The result is a wealth of data on how the 40,000 creators on the Hub interact, and naturally collaborate.

“If you understand how creators authentically make content and with whom you can pair groupings of creators with brands authentically, trust is not eroded,"" Cole said. ""[This occurs] between brand and influencer or between influencer and follower when there is full alignment between what the brand wants to say, what the influencer says, and what the creators ultimately ‘hear.’ The easiest way for this to happen is for the brand to cede creative control to a collection of passionate creative talent. To honor the creative vision of the creator(s). Their followers follow them for a reason. Protect that reason, leverage that reason; don’t undercut it with your own agenda.”

When this purity of vision is maintained across all levels, it also feeds into another value add of The Hub: the positive association among creatives on the platform.

“My favorite campaigns we have done are those that function like quilts – that is, dozens of creators each make their own, highly personalized patch that is woven into a larger fabric (a campaign),” Cole said. “The Hub community works best when 40 or 50 people all create something authentic to them and the chorus of voices makes something authentic to the brand for whom the content is being made. These quilts are made not by disinterested, segregated creators but by a living, breathing web of creative community.”

And this ‘quilt marketing’ approach has proven its sea legs – creators from the Hub have shot for Sotheby’s, Allbirds, Abercrombie, and others. Recently, when Brooks Brothers came to Cole to help rebrand a jewelry holding called Carolee, Cole and H Collective Head of Marketing Shannon Bray assembled 35 female creators from their community to produce a new type of creative campaign centered on forward-thinking female empowerment.

The result was 120 unique images taken across 28 shoots, three video assets, and 28 posts on Instagram that reached 1.4M people with over 8% engagement -- all produced in under two weeks.

This is where the power of a genuine community really announces itself, delivering a type of marketing that has never before existed -- decentralized creative marketing. Notably, this counteracts an increasing trend of distrust and distaste for existing advertising models. It’s why we see hearty year-over-year increases in the adoption of ad blockers; Millennials and Gen Z resent being spoken to, preferring to be spoken with.

While this might initially feel counterintuitive to brands hoping to tightly control their messaging, the lack of trust in the very creators they hope to work with limits the success of their efforts.

“The difference between this and every other type of media buy that's ever existed is that this is a person with a pulse -- you’re leaving chips on the table by not letting the people that are delivering ads put their own spin on it,” Cole said. “Their followers trust them in a way that they don't trust billboards or 30-second spots.”

This buy-in from creators -- which engenders trust and authenticity -- is what will ultimately bridge the gap between brand and consumer.

“Everything is decentralizing -- transportation with Uber, accommodation with Airbnb -- whatever industry you look at there's a decentralized play, where the supply can find its way to the exact demand, or the demand can find the unique supply very quickly,” Cole said. “That's what my community aspires to be for content. We’re elegantly introducing the right creative voices to the right microphones, allowing creativity to flow freely.”

"With the headline-grabbing reality of toxic behaviors in the office, far too many people face intimidation, disruptive behavior and bullying every day at work. When a boss or a co-worker make your work life more difficult by becoming a part of the problem, it hurts your ability and desire to perform.

Many people I meet with try to talk with the teammate in question, make complaints to human resources and follow protocol when intimidating or negative behavior occurs. That's healthy.

But what about when the quieter issues occur — the ones that may not seem to rise to the level of workplace ""violence"" per se? What about those times when your boss has a chance to stand up for you and protect you from seemingly innocent yet inappropriate behavior, but you're not quite part of the ""cool"" crowd to them?

When poor behavior by co-workers and bosses is accepted and allowed to flourish, it can take a toll on an organization. According to a study published in Harvard Business Review, employees claim these toxic incidents lead to:

• A decline in their commitment to the organization

Due to these issues, many otherwise good workers find a way to quietly detach, look for a new department or leave the company altogether.

One recent complaint about this came from a female client who was ""on the outs"" with her boss and co-workers because she wasn't comfortable with partying as much as they did at an international conference in Paris. As it turns out, the party involved drinks, a lost computer left behind by a drunken colleague and a couple of inappropriate ""hookups"" the night after the conference ended.

Because she opted out of all the craziness, she didn't receive warm praise or her boss's recommendations. When she hinted at complaining to human resources, she was told that ""what happens in Paris stays in Paris"" and that it ""wouldn't be career-advancing"" to bring the issue up again. She said to me, ""I never really wanted to leave my company or the job. I tried to make it work and tried to work with people, but I just wasn't part of their culture.""

Organizations must work to eradicate toxic behaviors and workplace relationships like these and promote trust and inclusivity instead. It comes down to hiring for character and demanding behavioral standards that are aligned with the organization's values — and aren't conditional upon location or state of mind. Companies that don't ignore the toll a toxic culture may take on their business should be proactive about how they lead, hire, fire, lay off or right-size.

Here are two things your organization can do to discourage toxic workplace behaviors and promote inclusivity.

Develop a clear policy on what zero tolerance means.

Policies around inappropriate workplace behavior must be written and cover not just fellow employees but everyone who comes in contact with the company or organization, including clients and customers. Many companies also tend to allow far too much leniency when it comes to contractors. These individuals should be held to the same standards as employees.

When explaining why she wanted to leave her company, one of my coaching clients told me, ""Our company had that 'zero-tolerance' policy among our fellow workers, including strong words around intimidation by management to subordinates, but just about anything was tolerated with our customers and stakeholders. Explicit talk and angry tirades in person and over the phone with suggestions of violence were tolerated because we viewed our customers as untouchable. You know, 'the customer is always right.'""

Zero tolerance means zero tolerance. It should protect each and every one of your employees – even at the risk of losing your customers and vendors.

Allow employees to opt out of company events.

A lot of silly behavior is tolerated in the name of fun. Companies that have open bars or parties that involve drinking may not be everyone's cup of tea. Don't make parties, midday events or drinks with clients or customers mandatory, and don't make fellow employees feel inferior for not joining. Make it cool for anyone to attend even if they don't join the total party scene, like by offering non-alcoholic drinks, for example.

An executive coaching client recently told me what makes her company so great is that it allows her to join in on events and provides plenty of options for participation that don't involve alcohol. She never feels like she's on the outs if she doesn't drink. In this way, her company ensures she's protected and never creates an atmosphere where her participation or lack of it would be job-advancing or job-jeopardizing.

Many companies don't notice what they tolerate and what they allow others to say or do. Provide your people with an environment that allows them to enjoy their work, grow, learn, contribute and be a part of something bigger. Your people should be able to live their values and participate in the fun at work without being pushed to join the party.",
"Do you have insurance for your small business? If not, you're not alone. A recent survey by Manta and Insureon found that fewer than three in 10 small business owners have a business owner’s policy, the basic business insurance that covers general liability insurance and commercial property insurance to protect you from loss.

Even fewer (21%) have Errors & Omissions (E&O) or professional liability insurance, 17% have workers compensation insurance, 6% have business interruption insurance, and only 2% have cyber insurance.

Of course, when you're starting a small business—and even as your business grows—there are plenty of other urgent needs competing for your dollars besides business insurance. For many small business owners, purchasing insurance can seem like an unnecessary luxury. They'd rather roll the dice and hope nothing bad ever happens to their business than commit to monthly or annual premiums.

There are lots of reasons why taking a chance with business insurance is a big mistake. The increasing frequency of severe weather events like floods and wildfires is putting more businesses at risk of damage to their property or equipment. No matter where you're located, the risk of a burglary or break-in is real. Can you afford to replace stolen computers or expensive equipment in case of theft? What would happen if a lawsuit hit your business?

To make sure you aren’t taking foolish chances with insurance, here's a quick rundown of the business insurance basics you should know.

The starting point for business insurance, this typically covers two of the biggest risks for entrepreneurs: general liability and commercial property. General liability insurance can protect you from lawsuits if a customer slips and falls in your store, or if you cause damage to a customers' property, among other things. Commercial property insurance generally covers loss or damage to your business’s property as a result of things like a fire that burns down your building or a burglary that picks your office clean.

If property damage that's covered by your BOP keeps you from operating your business, you've not only lost your property, but you're also losing income. That's when business interruption insurance can be a lifesaver. Business interruption insurance can help replace lost income during the time you can't run your business as usual. For example, if a business in Southern California was damaged by the recent wildfires, business interruption insurance could help the company stay on its feet during the rebuilding process.

Also called professional liability insurance, this type of insurance is most often used by professional service businesses. It helps protect against lawsuits caused by errors or negligence on the part of your company. For example, suppose you’re an accountant and you make a math error on one of your client’s tax returns that causes them to underpay taxes and results in a huge fine to the IRS. E&O insurance will help cover your costs if that client sues you for the error.

Even if you haven't made a mistake, when you're hit by a lawsuit you'll have to defend yourself, which means dealing with attorney and court costs, at minimum. In addition, some clients will actually require you to have this type of insurance before they'll sign a contract with you.

You don't need me to tell you that the risk of a cyber attack on your small business is real, and rising. Even big companies fall prey to cybercrime, and small businesses are much more vulnerable because they don't have huge IT teams and massive budgets to protect them.

But you could face a massive loss: The average cost of a small business cyber breach is more than $86,000, according to a study by Kaspersky. Cyber insurance can protect your business if you suffer a cyber attack or data breach. It can also protect you against lawsuits by customers, vendors, or others as a result of the attack; for example, if your e-commerce customers' credit card data is stolen and one of them sues you.

These aren't the only types of business insurance available. Key man insurance, commercial vehicle insurance, and workers' compensation insurance can all be equally important, depending on your business. The only way to know is to talk to an insurance agent.

To get the widest array of options, talk to an independent insurance agent who represents many different insurance companies. They can compare policies, coverage, and costs across different providers to give you the best value for your business. Ask professionals such as your banker, accountant, or other business owners in your area for recommendations to a good insurance agent.

Being a small business owner is risky enough. Don't make it riskier than it has to be by forgoing business insurance. The Hartford provides a number of options for small business insurance, as do other insurance carriers.

This article was originally published on AllBusiness.com.",None
"As the CEO of an agency collective, I'm in the business of matching brands with agencies that specialize in services such as marketing, branding, public relations and more. Here are the six areas I focus on when evaluating agencies for a brand or advising a brand on how to pick a partner.

It may sound obvious, but you want an agency you can trust. You want to make sure they’re going to provide a high level of service, be easy to work worth and be anchored by core values. Ask the agencies you’re interviewing to explain their “why” and give you an overview of their values. Look at the individuals inside of the agency to determine whether their values are aligned with the agency’s. The last thing you want is an agency that cares more about money than morals. It starts from the top, so get to know the agency founder and key leaders to see whether they carry themselves with character. Learn what they stand for (or against). If your values are misaligned, the relationship will be as well.

An agency’s culture is all about its employees, right? Wrong. An agency’s culture is part of its marketing. It tells you more than you need to know about the people you’ll actually be working with. Is it a culture of long days and late nights? A culture that gives employees freedom and flexibility? A culture of dogs and balance? Bottom line: Is it a culture you would want to be part of? If not, I’d immediately start to second-guess whether they’re the best fit. You want to a hire a team that you’d be happy to manage and collaborate with. Pay attention to the agency’s culture. Ignoring the culture of an agency is like hiring someone without meeting them in person. Your agency’s culture should connect with you.

It should go without saying that the agency you choose must have a bona fide capability when it comes to the work you wish for them to do. But there are varying degrees of capability, such as subpar, average, above average and excellent. And there’s a variety of ways to measure capability. For example, if you’re considering creative agencies, you can look at the awards they’ve won. Ultimately, though, it comes down to their work, their case studies and their results — the cold hard proof that they’re as good as they say they are. Spend more time reviewing their actual work than their capabilities deck.

Relevant experience reduces risk. After all, risk is found in the unknown. If an agency has “been there, done that” for a brand in the same category, chances are they can do it again. That said, don’t let category experience limit your options. Just because an agency doesn’t have a shining example in your exact category doesn’t mean they aren’t the perfect group to make it happen. Agencies with cross-category experience have insights and expertise from other industries that can be applied to yours. It’s a balancing act: Choose an agency with more category experience but less “wow” to reduce risk, or choose an agency with less category experience and more “wow” but take a chance. Ideally, if your search is comprehensive enough, you won’t have to settle for an agency without category experience. If you do, it’s likely the result of a relationship (which can make up for the risk).

The agency should be good at communicating during the sales process. Are they prompt and attentive? Do they listen well, take good notes and send relevant follow-ups? How buttoned-up or loose is their communication (and which do you prefer)? What’s the tone they take with you? Are they friendly, warm, condescending, “salesy,” etc.? How they communicate with you now is likely how they’ll communicate with you later, only amplified. That’s because communication is a reflection of culture. You’re getting a glimpse of the agency’s culture by the way they communicate. How do they make you feel? How transparent and honest are they? Do they listen or talk more? Make sure you’re partnering with someone you can effectively communicate with.

Last, but certainly not least, is chemistry. Chemistry is that intangible quality that lights up a relationship and makes life worth living. Chemistry happens when we’re working with people who share our values, our perspective and even our sense of humor. It’s that thing that makes us excited to roll up our sleeves together. You want an agency that you want to spend time with. You should want to go out with the agency principals. You should be excited about meetings. When chemistry happens, there’s nothing that can stop the ideas from flowing. The best collaboration happens when there’s chemistry to fuel the teamwork. Find an agency you’d like to take out to lunch, not just work with. Life is short, so spend it with people you like.",
"January is a popular time for , not only for individuals, but also for businesses. All of your can benefit from reviewing processes and decisions made in the past year, but in particular be looking at what they can learn from the last 12 months.

By starting 2019 with strong insights and goals, HR departments can ensure that they don't repeat mistakes and, more importantly, that they can retain your company's top talent. Ten experts from Forbes Human Resources Council offered some smart resolutions your HR department to make for the year ahead.

1. Set Clear Goals And Review Them Often

To set up the department for success for the next year, team members need to come together to review the past year and determine what goals they would like to accomplish in 2019. If everyone on the team has input, they will be aware of what needs to be accomplished over the next year. Once the goals are determined, have follow-up meetings quarterly to review tasks, so the team stays on track. - Debi Bliazis, Champions School of Real Estate

2. Study Your Turnover And Learn From It

Employee engagement is key to success in today’s market, so take a hard look at your turnover from the past year. Who did you let go and why? Did many people leave voluntarily, and if so, did they go to competitors? The answers to these questions will help you make improvements. For example, you might have to update your onboarding program and provide better training or mentorship opportunities. - Edward Fleischman, The Execu|Search Group

3. Base All Decisions On Data And Facts

Resolve to build quality and metrics into processes, as well as data and thoughtfulness into decision-making. This will ensure you are looking at the factual — not personal — aspects of a process and decision. This shifts the focus on what went wrong and why instead of who messed up. - Ushma Mehta, KenSci Inc.

At the end of the year, companies are typically focused on meeting numeric goals, so some may forget about their most valuable resource — their employees. Since employee disengagement costs companies billions of dollars each year in lost productivity, HR should communicate with employees individually through one-on-one meetings or retention interviews to help ensure they feel valued. - John Feldmann, Insperity

The new year presents an opportunity to revisit processes and decisions made in the past 12 months to reflect on projects and/goals that should stop, start or continue based on lessons learned and feedback from user stories. To be a strategic partner, HR needs to understand the business, speak the language and connect the talent goals to the business priorities. - Sherry Martin, OmniTRAX

To design programs that will have a real impact, the first step is to commit to the skill of ""fearless listening."" If you ask your people the kind of honest questions you might be afraid to hear the answers to, you will get the kind of quality feedback you are looking for. Fearless listening is the one resolution you need to create programs that will truly resonate with your people in 2019. - Lisa Sterling, Ceridian

7. Help Your People See Their Value

Be a leader. Inspire people. Help people understand the value they bring — not just to your company but to this world. If all of us take a larger approach to life, we can do wonders. We need to start with our own mind and help others clear theirs. A clear and focused mind can transform people, process and technology. - Abhijeet Narvekar, The FerVID Group

In the new year, shift from the one-size-fits-all HR approach and start practicing hyper-personalized leadership. Better understand your people’s unique needs by using advanced survey technology to measure workplace culture and gauge employee sentiment. Most importantly, act upon the feedback you receive and remain flexible with your leadership methods as your company evolves and grows. - Vivian Maza, Ultimate Software

Now more than ever, it is critical that human resources professionals understand the businesses they help to support. Equally important is the ability to build relationships with key individuals so that we can get to the business of people. If we cannot articulate why people matter and how our policies and programs help support strategic goals, then we cannot help the organization move forward. - Lucy Rivas-Enriquez, Union Rescue Mission - Los Angeles

HR departments and senior leaders should stop making resolutions and instead make commitments to those initiatives which bring pivotal change that is linked to the organizational strategy. The reality is that resolutions, whether business or personal, are rarely achieved because it's about involvement versus commitment. It's like bacon and eggs. The chicken was involved, but the pig was committed. - Bridgette Wilder, Wilder HR Management & EEO Consulting",coaching
"As their offices grow, and more and more people begin working remotely, many companies that started out as small, intimate groups may find themselves operating as a large, geographically dispersed team. While it may be easier to maintain your company’s vibe when numbers are small and team members are all in the same coworking space, your culture shouldn’t be restricted by office walls. It’s crucial to maintain a positive dynamic that encourages open communication, no matter where your workers are located.

As your business expands, you may be struggling to scale your culture and make your remote team members feel included. Below, experts from Forbes Coaches Council offer strategies to create a sense of community and grow your culture with your business.

1. Focus On Your People’s Needs

Company culture is a reflection of the values exhibited by the leadership team. Some of the foundational principles that guide the culture remain the same whether you have 10 employees or 10,000. It’s important to listen to your people and to take care of their needs. If you’re operating virtually, the vehicles to nurture those relationships will shift, but the core concepts remain the same. - Carolina Caro

Reflect on what your company culture is, because it will evolve over time. Then refine what you truly want and what you don’t want as part of the ideal culture you aspire for. Break it down into values and expected behaviors. Finally, release it with well-crafted related policies and standards, along with a powerful communication strategy, and plan to educate, inspire and remind employees. - Amy Nguyen, Happiness Infinity LLC

A company culture is created by everyone aligning around shared values. How each person expresses these values might be different, especially if your remote team is international. Ask each core team to collaboratively create their own Team Charter outlining their vision, rituals and common practices for living and breathing these shared values. This also will help new employees to quickly align. - Gabriella Goddard, Brainsparker Leadership Academy

More than just a list of words posted in a lunchroom, values should be an integral part of the company culture built into hiring and onboarding practices. Scaling this requires constant reinforcement. Every interaction, communication and hallway conversation is an opportunity to reinforce and strengthen the culture. Employees who feel connected to the culture become ambassadors for the company. - Tracey Grove, Pure Symmetry Coaching and Consulting

If culture is important, reward the people who take care of it — The people who will organize the birthday cards. The ones who will volunteer their spare time to help others. The ones who will take initiative to make the workplace better. Your employees will have more and better ideas about how to improve the culture than you will ever do. Empower them and reward them for going after them. - Caterina Kostoula, The Leaderpath

6. Ensure Your Culture Is Strong, But Flexible

As you scale operations, the DNA of a strong culture will be embedded through the company’s values as you hire, evaluate performance, promote employees and continue to grow. Enable remote offices and employees to flex within the culture to add more localized customs or traditions. This helps empower them and develops their leadership. If your values are solid, they will help sustain your culture. - Julianne Cenac Ph.D., The Leader Channel

Start with a communication plan. Address how, when and what individuals and teams will communicate. Provide remote employees with tools to stay connected and engaged virtually. Establish rules of engagement so individuals and teams trust and respect each other. Socialize the expectations, get feedback and, finally, institutionalize the outcome. - Alan Trivedi, MBA PCC, Trivedi Coaching & Consulting Group

8. Model The Culture During Group Meetings And Activities

When meeting with your team, virtually or in person, it’s important to model, verbally and nonverbally, your team culture. This can be communicated through your dress, the agenda (or lack thereof), the flow of interaction and so on. If you want to promote a structured culture, then you should provide structure; whereas a more relaxed culture may allow a more free flow of interaction. - LaKesha Womack, Womack Consulting Group

9. Empower Team Leaders To Scale Your Culture For You

Your direct influence on culture only extends to a limited number of people. The way the culture spreads is by empowering your team leaders to scale that culture for you. If the leaders you interact with most often feel responsible for the culture they establish within their team, you can scale culture. - Scott Swedberg, The Job Sauce

When scaling the culture of your company, it is essential to remember your “why” —  the purpose of your cause or the premise of what you believe. As your team grows, the goal is still sustainability. This is an opportunity to highlight the strengths of team members and identify areas of improvement. Learn to trust the longevity of the process, work as a collective and overcome challenges that arise. - A. Margot Brisky, ELDA4U, LLC

Culture doesn’t scale — it persists. If history is an example, cultures persist when they are rich with traditions, folklore and stories. Within a company, take notice of your traditions and institutionalize them. Understand which events were seminal to the organization and tell the stories. Celebrate your history, know what makes you special, build your tribe and your culture will persist. - Jim Vaselopulos, Rafti Advisors, Inc.

12. Web Conference To Bond, Not Just To Work

One of my clients held a Webex lunch meeting with his remote teams in India, Japan and the Netherlands at least once a week. They planned the food options, traded recipes and tried each other’s cuisine. This creative move developed bonds that didn’t just involve deadlines, holding people accountable and telling them what to do. It build esprit de corps that translated into productivity. - John M. O’Connor, Career Pro Inc.",
"Nonprofit leaders and employees are usually passionate about their organization’s mission, values and goals. This sense of personal fulfillment is often a benefit itself, so leaders and employees may not recognize that their long workdays, frequent travel and taking work home are detracting from essential self-care activities, such as exercise, healthy eating and sleep.

Less time for healthy habits and insufficient sleep often means more stress and poor posture. Combined, these risk factors can lead to greater burnout, higher health care costs and reduced productivity, derailing your organization from achieving its objectives.

That is why learning and practicing better sleep and posture habits is crucial and can simultaneously help decrease stress levels. Stress can be further reduced through other self-care activities and health care services, but a cultural commitment to schedule flexibility so employees -- and leaders -- have the time to eat healthy, exercise and rest is just as important.

In my 20+ years as a doctor of chiropractic and, more specifically, in my three years working as the executive vice president of the Foundation for Chiropractic Progress, I’ve seen firsthand how proper exercise, nutrition and sleep can positively impact an individual’s overall productivity, especially when you take into consideration the effects that long workdays and frequent travel can have on your body.

Diet and exercise fads seem to be national obsessions. Insufficient sleep, however, is perhaps the least discussed public health issue in the U.S. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 35% of U.S. adults do not get enough sleep, which can lead to diabetes, stroke, high blood pressure, heart disease, obesity and mental health problems, as well as a shorter lifespan.

For nonprofits, sleep deprivation not only damages your employees’ health; it negatively affects their performance as well. The U.S. loses about 1.2 million working days a year due to decreased productivity from sleep-deprived workers, which costs the economy about $411 billion a year.

One way to improve restfulness is by offering napping stations in your workplace, such as sleep pods, which look like space-age recliners with a large dome over the top to block light, noise and distraction. Sleep pods are used in organizations associated with demanding employee work schedules, such as law firms and corporations like Google, Samsung, Zappos, JetBlue and Cisco, as well as NASA.

Getting the recommended seven to nine hours of sleep a night, however, may be a challenge for some employees if they do not establish proper bedtime routines and sleeping positions that enable a more restful night’s sleep. Routines include dimming or shutting off screens an hour before bed and keeping the bedroom cool and dark during sleep.

As far as sleep positions, stomach sleeping should be avoided, as it impairs the natural curve of the spine, putting pressure on the joints and muscles and causing strain on your neck. Sleeping on your back with a pillow under your knees or side sleeping is also spine-friendly, as long as you keep your waist straight and a pillow between your knees.

2. Posture: More Than Just Looking Taller

Most nonprofit employees work in office settings, and many team members with fundraising duties travel frequently. Too much time spent at a desk or in airplanes and cars, as well as the hours a day spent looking at your phone, can negatively impact your posture.

Posture is not just about looking taller or feeling more confident; it has surprising consequences that affect our health and quality of life. Over time, bad posture can cause low back pain, which about 80% of adults experience at some point in their lives. Additionally, research reveals that back pain accounted for more than 264 million lost work days in one year.

The first step toward better posture is to establish a personal baseline. Have a friend photograph you or use a timer to do it yourself while standing as you normally would and another standing up straight. From there, practice self-awareness and correction of your posture while sitting, standing, walking and running. Keeping your feet on the floor or a footrest, for example, while sitting at a desk will help you maintain the proper spinal alignment and posture.

Seeking help from a health care professional, such as a doctor of chiropractic, can also help by correcting your posture and recommending exercises to strengthen your core postural muscles.

A good night’s sleep and proper posture are effective at reducing the third top productivity killer: stress. Nearly two-thirds of adults reported stress about work and money this year, followed closely by health and the economy.

Chronic stress can lead to numerous other mental and physical health problems, such as depression, substance abuse, digestive conditions and headaches. While this contributes to nonprofit organizations’ health care costs, stress-related chronic health problems can also cause burnout, impacting your team members’ performance and retention.

Establishing a culture where employees are encouraged to unplug and devote time to self-care and pleasurable activities with family, friends and their communities is essential. Seeking help from mental health professionals is also effective for managing stress, while many Americans report regular chiropractic care reduces their stress levels and improves their sleep and posture.

By pursuing these healthy self-care habits, nonprofit leaders and employees can maintain their organization’s productivity momentum while ensuring team members stay engaged, high-performing and full of passion.",
"How do you bring a new idea to market?

We have a great idea, a new product or service that can really make a difference in our customers’ lives. But how do we get it out there? At the end of the day, it’s the people you surround yourself with who realize the company’s mission and push that idea into the marketplace. Understanding your employees and knowing what motivates them — what gets them engaged in the big picture — is key to that success.

One of the most underutilized tools that business leaders have at their disposal to accomplish this is the workplace -- specifically, the actual physical space itself.

What comes to mind when you think of a workspace? For many of us, it’s a numbers game: the budget needed to lease out an office, the square footage of that space, the number of employees it can fit.

We might also think of space as an aesthetic or branding exercise. Does the look of the office reflect the company culture I want to promote? Does it capture our personality? Are our logos, company colors and awards clearly visible?

But workspaces operate on a deeper level than that. The workspace is about authenticity, and that sends a subconscious signal to the people working in those spaces about who and what they’re working for. Positive, engaging workspaces can instill feelings of trust and confidence and an atmosphere for collaboration and community.

Real innovation requires a certain level of trust, collaboration and fluidity among the people driving it. The ability for people to come up with new ideas depends on their ability to feel that they have access to their leaders, to the tools they need and to each other. The workspace is what communicates that accessibility exists.

The Limits Of The Traditional Office

In reimagining what the workspace should do, it’s worth taking a step back to diagnose the limitations that traditional office environments are saddled with today.

I was talking about this recently with one of my good friends, Guillaume Alvarez. Guillaume is an SVP for Steelcase, an office furniture manufacturer. As Guillaume told me, the characteristic that has the biggest negative impact on today’s workplace is the fact that the office often feels like a reflection of the company’s org chart. Just like on an org chart, in the office you’ll typically find the leaders secluded on the top floor. Middle managers get the window seats and corner offices, and the rank and file get grouped into the middle-of-the-floor pool of desks.

Right off the bat, this sends a negative signal to employees. It implies that leaders and managers are inaccessible — because often, they physically are — while everyone else gets grouped together into a blob at the bottom of the ladder. That kind of layout does not inspire confidence in employees, and it doesn’t make them feel valued, and that has a major impact on their mental well-being in the office. When well-being suffers, engagement suffers and, consequently, work suffers.

Bridging The Physical Divide Between Leaders And Employees

When business leaders are sitting on separate floors or in separate buildings from the rest of their employees, that creates a huge gap, both physical and psychological, between the two. This gap is compounded even more by things like access cards and security guards that put up more metaphorical and literal roadblocks between workers and their leaders.

These design choices hail from an older, now irrelevant way of working. And they’re getting in the way of today’s ways of working.

More businesses recognize this, and it’s led to some pretty interesting innovation in how offices work. One option is for business leaders get themselves into the natural circulation paths of the office. One way Steelcase approached this situation was by moving one company's CEO’s office into the path between the building’s main entrance and the café that employees regularly stop in. That’s a natural circulation path because everyone has to walk through that front door and through or into the café. Consequently, everyone will walk by the CEO’s office. That way, an employee and an executive don’t need to go out of their way to meet. Instead, they casually walk by each other and maybe stop for a quick chat, helping to build up a trusting, comfortable relationship.

That access is important for letting employees know what their leaders are up to (and vice versa) and ensures that leaders can better take the temperature of their organization.

When you get down to it, there are no across-the-board best practices for optimizing workspaces. The right environment is contextual; it’s unique to each organization and its culture. Workspaces should be driven by people, not color schemes or layouts or furniture. Once you’ve defined your culture — the kind of company you are and the company you want to be — you can nail down the attributes for the space itself.

The right workspaces help to get workers and business leaders more engaged with each other and more engaged with the mission of the company. You can’t innovate if you’re not engaged in what you’re doing. So, don’t get bogged down in the details of square footage and furniture placement. What matters is that the people in the company are defining what that space should look and feel like, and are active participants in shaping their environments. When the people are driving change in how the company looks and feels, that extends to driving change throughout the company and innovating on what that business has to offer.",
"The terms ""changing jobs"" and ""changing careers"" are often used interchangeably. Some people consider taking a comparable job at a new company as a career change, while others believe you must change fields in order to change careers. The federal government does not track career change data per se, because there is no consensus for defining this term.

For our purposes, let's define a career change as:

• Advancing to a higher position in the same field, especially from non-managerial to a managerial role in the organization, or

I speak as one who has helped professionals transition from existing jobs into careers in life coaching. Among those who choose to change careers, the prerequisites to a successful transition include answering the following questions:

• Are you motivated enough to take the risks?

• Do you have a clear vision for your desired future?

• Can you plan the transition wisely?

• Are you willing to work diligently until you get what you want?

Who Wants To Change Careers?

A 2017 survey found that among 1,044 respondents, 59% of working adults and specifically 73% of thirtysomething professionals are interested in changing careers. Twelve percent sewer professionals in their 20s are wanting a job change today than in 2013, but 65% still seek a change. Professionals in their 40s stayed consistent between 2013 and 2017, with 60% of this group wanting to change careers.

The older population is also seeking new career opportunities. The American Institute for Economic Research found that workers aged 60 and up are retiring later and often changing careers to remain in the workforce. Eighty-two percent of workers over the age of 50 state that they will work for pay after retirement. The AIER study found that between 16 million and 29 million people over the age of 45 attempted career changes, and 82% were successful during the survey period.

Beyond the changing employment market, people change careers for several reasons.

1. Burnout: According to the University of Phoenix survey, 29% of workers polled cited burnout as a reason to change careers. Burnout can be caused by overfamiliarity with a job or simple loss of interest. It is common to experience burnout in high-stress occupations or when there have been layoffs and fewer people are required to perform the same amount of work.

2. Lack of upward mobility: Lack of career advancement is responsible for 27% of employees seeking career changes. While this is true of all workers, millennials face additional obstacles. A report by the Young Invincibles states that millennials earn 20% less than baby boomers did in 1989 at age 25. It also found that they are better educated, but have fewer opportunities at work.

3. Loss of interest: This career-change motivation is most likely to apply to those in their 30s, 40s and 50s, as well as those earning between $75,000 and $100,000 per year, according to the Phoenix poll. These individuals often find that the career paths they chose during college are not good fits, or that they no longer find them fulfilling.

This tells us that many workers are not doing what they love. When your heart is in your work, these issues tend to be less relevant. Imagine your work representing your passion in life: You know how much you’re making a difference in the world. Your work represents what you believe in. How likely would burnout and loss of interest be to play a part in your daily life then? Even upward mobility may take a back seat when you’re doing something you consider meaningful.

How Can Workers Overcome The Barriers To Career Change?

Despite the desire to change careers, the majority of working adults hesitate to take this step. The University of Phoenix study identified the primary barriers to career change as:

2. Uncertainty about the next steps.

5. The belief that it's too late in life or career to make a change.

These appear to be formidable barriers. How can people overcome them?

Overcome Multiple Barriers To Successful Career Change With One Realization

You could dive into details and figure out how to overcome each of these obstacles, and that may be a great idea. Yet, as long as one critical piece is missing, the process will feel more difficult than it has to be.

Purpose. When you discover a deeper purpose in your work, the obstacles feel more like worthy challenges than formidable barriers. When you know in your heart that you're doing the right thing — the one that brings meaning and fulfillment into your life while adding value to others' — you can't help but want to move toward it. If your only reason to change careers has to do with what you dislike about your current career (and you secretly know every career has a downside), the obstacles will loom. Procrastination has a way of setting in.

A burning desire to do something you find meaningful seems to provide the motivation to proceed, even though the process represents understandable risks, a substantial investment of time and thorough planning.

Five Questions To Ask Yourself

To discover your purposeful career, start within. Ask yourself questions (better yet, live with these questions until the answers come) such as:

1. What is most important to me in life?

2. What have I always been passionate about?

3. What would I do every day even if I weren't paid?

4. What problem do I most want to solve for people?

5. If I were free to do anything, what would it be?

Now, you're moving in the direction of purpose. Don't expect to know your purpose immediately, especially if you've never given it much thought. Live with these questions. Ask yourself others. Talk to people who have found their purpose, and ask how they discovered it. Make it a project, and you'll be on your way.",
"Managers tend to be well practised at recognising employees who are failing to meet their performance targets and staff who are excelling at work; but what about those in the middle? The employees who are just doing enough to get by so their adequate performance isn’t picked up? According to a recent poll, one in three (32%) people in the UK say they are 'coasting' at work.

Warning signs of ‘coasters’ include poor interaction with colleagues, failure to participate in discussions, and a negative attitude, including appearing bored and unengaged with business initiatives.

Not taking action to stop employees coasting can have a negative impact on the rest of the team; after all, what is the point of some putting in extra effort if this is not required by other team members? The employee may also leave after a short tenure because they feel bored, disengaged and unmotivated during the working day. So what can managers do to stop employees 'coasting' at work?

First, it is important to recognise that coasting employees may have an underlying issue causing their ‘just enough’ commitment to work. Whether the issue is work-related or personal, this can have a significant impact on how the employee performs during working time. Managers can act proactively here; have a quick, informal talk with the employee and ask if they have any concerns. This may reveal that the employee doesn’t feel confident with a particular system or they misunderstand a procedure. If so, positive action can be taken to address this such as training. Alternatively, where personal issues are affecting the employee, managers can highlight the support available for the employee such as the availability of an employee assistance programme (EAP).

Employees may coast where they lack motivation and interest in their role with many contributing factors such as being in the same role for a long period of time. You can assess whether your employees are being challenged and developed in their working life, from both a professional and personal viewpoint. Ask employees whether they wish to undertake training opportunities or if they would like to work towards a different or higher role within the business. Employees who feel they are benefitting and developing from their employment are likely to put more effort into their role. A challenge can also spark a higher effort, with initiatives such as daily or weekly incentives spurring employees into action by awakening their competitive spirit.

You can also assess whether your internal business practices encourage continual effort from employees, or whether they allow a performance dip. Are employees set challenging-yet-realistic targets and objectives that encourage a positive work ethic? Do staff understand when reviews for performance and salary will take place during the year, and are these regular enough to require high performance across the entire review period? Even without formal reviews, are informal periodic meetings held with team members to talk through their work achievements? Small adjustments to your working practices can help encourage a higher work rate from all employees.

As well as focusing on the individual employee, you can review how effective your management team are at encouraging extra effort from their teams. In fact, your culture of coasting may have been inherited from your management team, so it is important to ensure managers are not just getting by. To instil a positive culture, managers need to be encouraging, enthusiastic and constructive to keep their team members engaged at work. Recognising achievements on both an individual and team basis will also help employees feel valued for their effort and encourage continued active engagement.",
"It’s year-end and you’re taking inventory: where you are isn’t where you want to be.  And you ask yourself—how did you get so stuck in a rut?

It’s so easy to blame someone or something else: your boss, your colleagues, the customers, your commute. But here’s the hard question that, if you’re like most people, you won’t ask as you contemplate your career in the new year: Are you all in?

This question holds the secret to getting ahead in your career, not only for the work you do, but also for how you do it—ideally, by being indispensable to your boss, exuding passion and purpose, helping others and sharing credit with the team. No, you don’t need to be Mary Poppins, magically getting everything done as you whistle a happy tune. But you do need to step up your commitment to prove to your boss – and to yourself – that, yes, you’re really all in!

The hard truth is that most people just aren’t that committed. Sure, they want to get ahead and make more money, but they don’t really want to do the extra work to get there—not to mention the extra work that comes with being promoted to a bigger job. They’re among the 80% who do the 20%—like these characters:

These hapless characters share a fatal flaw: they avoid taking an honest look in the mirror. They not only have blind spots—they guard them. They hold back, blame others, and spend more time gossiping and complaining at the water cooler than doing actual work.

But that isn’t everyone. There is another group—the 20 percent who accomplish the 80 percent—who are all in. They’re fully committed and indispensable especially to the boss. Their primary focus isn’t on getting recognized; that happens automatically because of the value they generate.

So how do you get there? Take a page from this cast of characters:

If being all in sounds like real work, it is. But being that committed is its own reward, with greater engagement, satisfaction and the empowerment to really advance your career in the new year.",
"Performance management meetings are a great opportunity for managers to reflect back on employee achievements, discuss and clarify goals for the next year, and provide feedback vital to growth and development. When executed correctly, performance conversations provide motivation, clear direction, and help managers form stronger bonds with employees.

Unfortunately, there's a downside too. If not managed appropriately, performance management meetings can cause confusion, frustration, and create tension between managers and employees. For this reason, many managers would prefer to skip this time of year altogether.

Comparing employees against their peers through confidential calibration sessions is a great way to differentiate performance and provide objective development examples. However, it should stop there. Comparing employees publicly will divide the team and create a competitive environment that could result in cutthroat, unethical behavior.

Too much competition can limit employee risk-taking, creativity, and teamwork -- no one wants to be identified as the ""weak link.""

Keeping your conversation focused on employee goals and performance outcomes is the best way to ensure the discussion is objective. Once you start critiquing personality, things can get subjective quickly.

Focusing on past mistakes is counter-productive. Instead, managers should provide solution driven, future-focused feedback. In other words, help employees understand what they can do in the future to improve their performance.

Although important to address and learn from, isolated incidents should be treated as such -- isolated and outlying. Using the example to generalize employee performance will taint the conversation and put employees on the defensive. And, no one is open to feedback when they feel like they've been unfairly characterized.

Don't go over-the-top with the compliment sandwich technique. I once had a manager that only provided positive feedback during our face-to-face meeting, and then blindsided me with criticism on my formal review. It was upsetting and demotivating.

6. Not listening or interrupting the employee.

If employees feel like you're not paying attention, or if you constantly interject your opinion without listening first, then they'll shut down. I get it, you have a lot of experience and you want to share it. However, when coaching others, it's more about listening than incessantly talking.

Instead, ask great questions and listen. In the process, employees will lead you to appropriately solutions, and they'll feel heard at the same time.

When you start questions like, ""Don't you think...?"" employees know what you're doing. It's an attempt to lead them to an answer that the manager desires, and it feels like manipulation. At that point, employees become indifferent, or they go along with it and provide false or slanted information.

To the best of your ability, make sure your questions aren't biased and leave room for the employee to provide their opinion.

This goes without saying, but if you base reviews on feelings, personal opinions, or impressions, employees will feel like you have a personal vendetta against them. Keep performance meetings fair by remaining objective.

Although it helps, you don't have to like someone to manage them. Differing work styles and approaches can be good for the team's dynamics.

9. Solving the employee's problem for them.

For time sake, many managers solve employees' problems for them. They teach them what to think. This approach might work if the employee is faced with the same issue in the future, but that's typically not the case.

Rather than doing all the work for them, managers should focus on helping employees problem solve on their own. They should teach them how to think. Through the process of leading them to mutually agreed upon solutions, managers will develop independent thinkers who can act autonomously.",
"Any of us who have moved into higher levels of leadership know that if you can't delegate, you're in big trouble. There's just no way to keep up with everything that needs to be done (and maintain any degree of sanity, at least) if you don't figure out how to delegate, who to delegate to, and just how to get comfortable with the fact that you are no longer able to do it all.

There are a lot of approaches to delegation, how to do it well, how to figure out who to delegate to, and how to manage the work and people to whom you have delegated. One prevailing strategy many of us have used, or even been coached to use, is to delegate to experts. Delegate out the work in which we ourselves are not particularly well versed, deeply knowledgeable, or have expertise.

In other words, delegate the stuff you don't know how to do to others who do know who to do it. Keep the work you know well for yourself.

The Trap of Delegating The Stuff You Don't Know

On the surface, this seems like a great strategy. The work gets allocated to the right person or people who know how to do it. They are happy because they get to do things they are confident about and have some skill. You are happy because you don't have to try to figure it out. And you can feel comfortable that you don't have to manage them tightly because they know what they are doing. You can go on and work on other things.

First, for you as a leader (and the person ultimately accountable for the overall work), it is difficult to evaluate the outputs of the people to whom you have delegated. You trust your people, of course, but you don't really have the ability to provide insight, coaching, or challenge perspectives because you yourself don't have the knowledge. You can certainly ask questions that come from ""fresh"" or ""outside"" eyes - which is always valuable - but there is a limit to what you can assess without the knowledge.

Second, and maybe more importantly, no one grows. The experts on your team don't grow their skill sets and capabilities. And unfortunately, neither do you. And so you can very easily fall into the trap of regularly needing to delegate that specific work out into perpetuity.

The Counterintuitive Notion of Delegating The Stuff You Know The Best

Earlier in my career, I had a leader who practiced what we, as corporate neophytes, thought was kind of strange. At the very least, it was counterintuitive to us. He delegated out the things he knew the best, and he took ownership for the things he knew the least.

I thought it was a bit strange, but what did I know? It turns out that he knew just a bit more than I did about how to do this well (what a surprise, in hindsight). What we all watched happen and lived through was really valuable.

Our leader seemed to constantly get smarter and develop more breadth of knowledge. To get there, he modeled to us how to figure out problems or dive into content areas where you had little knowledge. We benefited from watching him do this in front of us and got better at doing it ourselves.

At the same time, we got much better coaching and mentoring on the work he had delegated out to us - mostly because he knew it so well. In turn, our work got done faster and with better outputs. We ended up growing faster in our own development.

In the end, it isn't possible to know everything, and sometimes you just have to delegate out things you don't know. But what this counterintuitive approach to delegation taught me early in my career is that we shouldn't blindly delegate the things we don't know how to do. There can be great learning and growth benefit for everyone involved if we flip things a bit.",
"Just over a year ago, Dara Khosrowshahi took over the reins at Uber. The company's board had decided it was time for a change, as its previous CEO, cofounder Travis Kalanick, was struggling with the challenges of moving to the next level, along with the manifestation of a toxic culture.

Khosrowshahi had proved successful at running the travel-focused Expedia Group, but he was only one of a handful of candidates vying for the vacant spot.

Let's go back in time, just before the Uber board made its decision on the new chief executive. Candidates were expected to deliver individual presentations; the time had now come for Khosrowshahi to make his case.

""I was just dead honest about what I brought to the table and what I thought I needed in order to succeed at the company,"" Khosrowshahi said in a recent, revealing discussion at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. ""I talked about my expectations of the board...and also that with the founders of the company being very much a part of the company spirit and culture and what built that company, if they really wanted a new leader of that company it needed to be very clear who the leader was, and that I expected the board to be there for me but I needed the freedom to maneuver appropriately and make changes that I felt needed to be made quickly because this was a tough situation.

Of course, Khosrowshahi got the job in the end--and after a year in his new role, he seems to be steering the company in the right direction.

The value of respectful authenticity

Over the past year, Khosrowshahi has demonstrated his use of emotional intelligence to reach others on a visceral level. Whether it's a persuasive presentation or a powerful email, he finds a way to make others think and motivate them to action.

The problem with the ""dead honest"" approach is that it can work to your disadvantage, if you're not careful. Nobody wants to work with a brilliant jerk, someone who constantly criticizes you in a way that makes you feel stupid or that takes away your dignity.

But if you can be authentic while showing respect, if your words and actions convince them that you're on the same side and that your goal is to help--now you've got something special.

Of course, just because you're respectful doesn't mean people will always appreciate what you have to say.

For example, Khosrowshahi says initially one of the board members told him that his frankness wasn't so well received. Khosrowshahi responded by saying, ""Well, if it wasn't that well-received man I'm glad. Because this is important to me.""

Direct feedback, negative feedback, is hard to take. But smart people, growth-oriented people, will appreciate it--as long as it's delivered in a way that's meant to help and not harm.

In the end, Khosrowshahi was hired because rather than focus on saying what the board wanted to hear, he told them what they needed to hear--but he did so with respect.",
"How do “leaders” get labeled in your organization?  While most organizations these days have a special emphasis on “developing leaders,” selection to these groups varies widely—from seasoned senior managers being considered for promotion to the executive ranks . . . to those members with less than three years’ experience about to become a first-time supervisor.

Despite these variations in who gets labeled as a leader, they typically have five characteristics in common:  all evident in their communication style and habits.

5 Ways Your Communication Marks You As A Leader—Or Not

As a leader, you know how to gather information and input from many sources. You can analyze and synthesize information into a clear, coherent message that everyone can understand. You work hard to avoid jargon, insider lingo, and examples that connect with only a few. You use precise words, short sentences, and a simple message that everybody on the team understands. You fight complexity like an enemy.

When you walk into a room, your body language says you plan to engage. By your presence, you exude energy, passion, caring, an air of authority.

When you speak, you command attention. Conversation opens up to include you. When you ask a question, people respond. When you offer an idea, coworkers give it serious consideration. When you take initiative, others follow.

As a leader, if you “own” a meeting, you facilitate the discussion and lead the group to analyze, decide, or act. If you’re a participant, you engage, contribute, and take responsibility for results. This is not to say you monopolize or fail to listen to input from others. But it does mean that when you’re in charge, you lead. And when your role is to follow, you engage and participate fully.

With a group, you do not hold back in “safe” mode, operating on auto-pilot.

You have built a track record of trust by communicating in an accurate, direct, and positive manner. Your past interactions have been based on accurate facts, relevant data, and solid reasoning. Your conclusions and recommendations typically “pan out” over time.

And on the few occasions when you may have been inaccurate or may have misjudged a situation, you have acknowledge your mistake and held yourself accountable. As a result, this accountability has increased—rather than decreased—your credibility.

Their track record continues to provide you a shortcut to further trust and influence.

You do your homework. When you deliver a presentation, write an email, or submit a report, you’re persuasive.  Because of the power of your communication style, you persuade others to change their mind, to buy into your conclusions and recommendations, to buy a product or service, to change the way they do things, to accept feedback or change, or to engage with the mission.

Your words have impact because they deliver substantive results. Your work makes a difference to others, to the team, or the entire organization.

With you, people get what they see. No masks. You are who you appear to be.

Your communication underscores your authenticity. Who you are comes through in your word choices, tone, body language, attitudes, habits, and daily actions. People around you see congruency, not hypocrisy.

Hypocrisy leads to distrust and rebellion; congruency attracts respect and followers.

The resulting likeability continues to expand your reputation and impact. Congruency with core values deepens respect. On the other hand, incongruency—hypocrisy—can shatter credibility overnight.

On the other hand, if all the above does not describe you, your situation, and others’ reactions to you, then you may want to double-check your communication style against those leaders who succeed at the highest levels. Strive to

Your impact depends to a great extent on how you communicate. Ask any leader or their supporters.

"Last Friday, a colleague said, “I’m not ready for it to be Friday.” Rather than the TGIF-ing and high-fiving the rest of us were doing, she was lamenting all the work that she hadn’t been able to pack into that week’s five days. We all have weeks like that, where there is too much to do and too little time.

Some of us want more time for personal pursuits. When my kids were young, all I had on my holiday wish list was time – time to myself, time by myself and time to do my own thing. Even those who aren’t moms or dads regularly say they wish they had more time for themselves. It’s not that we’re antisocial, it’s just that we’re overwhelmed.

Time has become one of our most precious commodities in a society where we never have enough and it’s always slipping away too fast. Being busy has become a social badge of honor. When was the last time you asked someone how they were and they didn’t say ,“I’m so busy”? It’s as if busyness has become synonymous with importance.

But, the work-life conundrum is legitimately tough to navigate and especially during the holidays there is frequently too much to do and too little time in which to do it. Key projects are finishing for the year, performance reviews are due and we have more personal demands than ever.

What if we really could give the gift of time?

In the office there are three ways we can contribute to people’s positive use of time:

Be efficient and plan-ful. When meeting with colleagues, plan ahead for the time you’ll spend and be prepared for what you want to cover so you can be as efficient as possible.

Be respectful. Show up on time to meetings so you’re not wasting others’ time. In addition, respect others’ schedules and boundaries. A friend used to say, “his lack of planning is not my emergency.” Know that what’s number one on your list of priorities may only be number six or seven on someone else’s list.

Be intentional. Choose when to engage people. Avoid a scattershot approach for meetings or emails where everyone is invited to everything or everyone receives the email. Consider who really needs to be involved and who really needs to know in order to reduce clutter and the time it takes to cut through it.

But, it’s the holidays so beyond use of time in the office it’s also relevant to think of gift-giving ideas for friends and family. Here are five ways to make the gift of time tangible:

Fitbit or health tracking device. Better health leads to more years of life, so this gift is as tangible as it gets.

Yoga or Tai Chi classes. Fostering presence and mindfulness through a practice like yoga or tai chi can help extend time and encourage us to be more appreciative of the moments we’re in.

Learning games. When our minds are spry, the years we live will be more fulfilling. Puzzles, games and logic challenges (think of games like Set or jigsaw puzzles) can help keep our brains challenged and learning.

Delivery or convenience services. Give the gift of meal delivery, dry cleaning, car wash, or house cleaning services in order to save time on more mundane tasks

Restaurant gift certificates. Give the gift of time together and connection, with gift certificates for meals or coffee out with friends.

While having more time may seem elusive, it is possible to give the gift of time – whether at the office or in the giving of actual gifts for friends and family.

When we have enough time during the week, it makes the weekends that much sweeter to enjoy. The gift of time may really be possible to give, allowing us not only a TGIF, but also a TGIM, TGIT, TGIW, THITh. (Okay, we can always dream.)",
"Managing other humans can feel like you’re dealing with a non-stop wave of complaints, conflicts and chaos. No one probably told you about the pressure that comes with having your performance evaluated on how others show up. How do you deal with people claiming favoritism, complaining about stagnant career development and falling short of performance expectations? Believe it or not, the majority of those issues — and others — could be eliminated by having a “manager method.” This simply means applying a management process year-round to every employee who reports to you.

Here are the key elements of a successful manager methodology that you can start using with your direct reports today:

Get to know what makes your employees tick. If you were given a new computer that used a totally different operating system than you were used to, you’d probably take a glance at the user’s manual. Why wouldn’t you want to do the same with new employees? So how do you get a peek at your new direct report’s user’s manual? As soon as he or she starts reporting to you, set up some time to discuss their interests, motivators and goals. This gives you insight into what actually motivates this person while setting the tone that you care about them as much as you do about getting the work done.

Set up a year-round performance alignment dialogue . Let your staff know that the purpose of these check-ins is to ensure that you and they are aligned on the work and performance expectations. Be clear that they will drive calendaring quarterly discussions and you will ensure those meetings are prioritized. During the meetings, look for themes that go beyond the day-to-day issues. View this time as a genuine two-way dialogue that generates ideas and solutions to your most important performance challenges. And if one of those challenges happens to involve how well you and the employee communicate, deal with it here.

Conduct an annual career discussion that’s not connected to a performance review . Too often managers and employees wait until the end of the year to bring up performance issues and career aspirations. At best, this makes for an awkward conversation. At worst, it makes that conversation way less likely to happen at all. Many managers only discuss career opportunities with their top performers because they have little issues to work through during a performance review. However, this tends to lead to perceptions of favoritism and keeps the poor performance from evolving since the other individuals feel there is little reward for effort. By having annual career conversations with everyone, you ensure each person gets to share what they really want to do and you get the insight you need to help them evolve their own performance.

Solicit feedback on your leadership style. By showing that you’re interested in your staff’s opinion of your leadership skills, you foster a “feedback culture.” And by putting a process around asking for that feedback, you create a true dialogue. Let’s face it, no matter how well-intentioned, feedback that feels one-sided can foster resentment and stress rather than collaboration and problem-solving. You can solicit feedback directly or use anonymous surveys. How you react to the feedback is actually the important part. Be aware of the power dynamic between you and your direct reports. Acting respectfully here teaches your staff that it’s safe to be candid with you. There’s a bonus for your team members, as well: Learning how to give feedback to leadership in a productive and respectful way will empower them throughout their careers to influence their own work environment.

Practice discretion. While it’s tempting to vent to those with those you click best with on your staff — don’t. You’re courting disaster as a people manager if you do. Simply put, you don’t get to complain to your staff about your staff. Not only will you destroy trust with the employee, but you’ll also hurt your credibility with those who have to listen to you complain. How can they know you don’t speak just as poorly about them to others? Same goes for your peers. While you should absolutely seek help from fellow managers to work through performance challenges, keep the focus on improving your approach and don’t let the conversation devolve into a bitch session. If you do, you’ll be hurting your employee’s reputation and potentially damaging your own rep among your peers, who will wonder how you talk about them when they’re not around. Finally, your own manager doesn’t want to hear you complain about anyone. They want to know about any critical issues and what you’re doing to solve them. If you must, do your venting with friends over a beer.",
"As long as companies are in business and want to grow, they're constantly looking for ways to improve the results from their sales team. Usually, this is done by some combination of hiring additional resources, adding new products and providing ongoing training. Whether you're looking to create a sales team or expand an existing one, there are a few misconceptions you should address if you want to have a sales team that's truly thriving.

I just have to find and hire rock stars.

Every sales leader who's building a team wants to start by hiring the best, the brightest and the most experienced sales professionals they can find. That's an admiral goal to have, but one that's often hard to achieve. It's impossible for every company to have all the best talent. The reality is that most sales teams will have professionals with varying degrees of talent.

Perhaps a better goal is to first ensure that you have the appropriate environment — one with a clear vision, properly set expectations, easy-to-understand procedures and great sales leadership. These characteristics are usually present with teams that are highly productive. When certain aspects are missing from the environment, great talent will leave. In fact, high turnover is a sign that something is missing. There are few things more damaging to a company than having highly qualified professionals leave because the environment is not conducive to accomplishing great things.

It's all about activity.

I recently had a company explain to me how it administers a productivity bonus in the first six months of its salesperson’s tenure, since the salesperson isn’t expected to close many sales immediately. During this initial period, the more meetings they have, the higher their productivity bonus. It's the age-old “fill the funnel” concept, which theorizes that the more prospects one engages, the more successful they'll be. The idea is that the more people who know about your business, the better. No one will argue that activity is a bad thing. However, it's the quality, not the quantity, that's most important.

If the overall goal of the salesperson is to generate the most revenue, then we can’t mistake activity for accomplishment. Increased activity will lead to increased brand awareness, but by itself, it doesn’t lead to increased revenue. In fact, if you're not careful, a concentration solely on increased activity could have negative impacts. It doesn’t usually benefit the company to have salespeople talking to prospects who are never going to buy. Each minute a salesperson spends with someone who's not going to buy is a minute they're not spending with someone who is willing to buy. It's critical for them to learn how to differentiate.

There's nothing wrong with measuring the activity of your sales professionals, but doing so without regard to quality is a mistake. It could lead to behavior that's not desired. Having meetings solely for the purpose of reaching some measured activity level is not helpful to the team. Those type of meetings can take time away from engagement with prospects who want to buy your product or solution.

Standardized training will make everyone better.

When setting up a team for long-term success, it's imperative to establish certain processes. Having a structured way for exchanging leads, creating proposals, answering questions and enhancing product knowledge is important for helping sales professionals become more productive. However, when it comes to professional development, more individualized attention is often needed. With some products, solutions and situations, standard sales training is enough. For others, additional coaching and mentoring may be needed.

I've been part of organizations where 99% of the training was on how to deliver an effective PowerPoint presentation followed by an impressive product demo. This is a common approach for many companies. However, there are so many other facets of the sales cycle that were not adequately addressed, such as how to assess where you are in the process, how to effectively negotiate, how to manage expectations, how to adequately assess when the deal will close, etc. Some professionals were great at delivering a PowerPoint presentation but bad at understanding how to negotiate, while others were average at presenting but great at assessing a situation. Even with those differences, everyone always had the exact same training.

My advice is to treat each sales professional as unique, even if they're selling the same product or service. Aim to provide the most relevant support to each person on your sales team. Training everyone to do the same thing the same way could hinder some of their abilities, which could eventually lead to higher turnover.

There can be many challenges to building and sustaining a high-quality, high performing sales team. Not only do you have to find enthusiastic and talented professionals, but you also have to create an environment where everyone can thrive. When it comes to sales, it's often not just about the perceived value of the product or service. Prospects usually evaluate the sales professional, then the company and then the product or service. Therefore, the best way to build a highly effective sales team is to first concentrate on building up each individual sales professional.",
"I find that “strategy” is one of the most overused and underappreciated words in business. Sometimes misclassified as a specific goal or objective, a strategy is a plan of action aimed at achieving the success of a goal or objective.

When we talk about sustainable marketing strategy, we are looking to build a long-term plan that will prevail in its current state over time. This is why it is imperative to take the necessary steps and build the right marketing strategy from the beginning.

Here are four questions you need to ask yourself when building your sustainable marketing strategy:

1. What are you going to do? This may be obvious, but it’s actually not. What specific actions are you going to take? Be holistic and encompass everything, but ensure that your plan is realistic. List out the details.

2. Why are you going to do it? Based on what you are going to do, why is that the best course of action? What are your opportunity costs? Explain the benefits of your plan and how it will affect not just your firm but, most importantly, your customer. Don’t leave anything to chance.

3. How are you going to win? Your plan needs to be measurable. What is the projected outcome if your strategy goes as planned? How and to what extent will you measure your plan throughout its existence? What metrics will you utilize?

4. How are you going to sustain the win? In order for a strategy to be effective, it must be sustainable. Your plan can have quick wins, but how does your plan exist long term? What are the risks of your plan? How does competition affect your ability to execute on your strategy?

Based on my experience, many organizations and marketing teams are effective with the first three questions but fail to execute on the last question: How are you going to sustain the win?

Here, we need to identify macro risks of the strategy that could affect sustainability as well as the competitive landscape of the business’s ecosystem. For macro risks, understanding the acronym “PESTLE” is beneficial to outlining potential unforeseen, scalable shifts in society.

• Political: Risk is derived from changes in government, policies or foreign leadership. How could these risks affect your strategy?

• Economical: Risks are due to market changes such as stocks, treasuries, foreign trade, etc. Other risks to consider include inflation, recessions and unemployment. How could changes to economic factors affect your plan?

• Social: These risks relate to society and shifts in consumer behaviors or habits. How could changes in consumer elasticity of demand harm the strategy?

• Technology: Risks are caused by shifts in current technology. How could investments in current technology affect your future strategy? How dependent is your plan on current technology?

• Legal: These risks relate to legal modifications. How do shifts in laws, compliance or legislation affect your plan?

• Environmental: Risks are related to the environment and creating a sustainable earth. How can shifts in environmental requirements or corporate sustainability movements affect your strategy?

After looking at the macro effects of creating a sustainable marketing strategy, you should have a fairly robust plan that accounts for large, external risks across a series of categories. The next step involves understanding the competition.

Here, we need to look at the competition holistically from the lenses of the entire competitive ecosystem to explore the true risks involved with the strategy related to competition. Consider four of Porter’s five forces to explain your competition risks within your sustainable marketing strategy.

1. Bargaining Power Of Buyers: We need to understand how much negotiating power our customers have on us. What does the competitive landscape look like? Do we hold a high differentiation versus our competitors? Is there a surplus of competitors?

2. Bargaining Power Of Suppliers: Now, we need to know how much negotiating power our suppliers have on us. What are the switch costs? Is there an abundance of competitors?

3. Threat Of New Entrants: Next, we need to understand how easy new competitors can evolve. Are there barriers to entry? What are the startup costs? What is the human capital required to establish a similar business?

4. Threat Of Substitutes: Lastly, we need to review what consumers could utilize, aside from our product or service, to satisfy the existing need. Is there an alternative solution? How easy is it for your product or service to be replaced by an alternative solution?

By going through these four questions, understanding the macro risks and reviewing the competitive ecosystem, your marketing strategy will be tested in order to become more sustainable for the future. As challenges arise, the strategy must be flexible and adapt to changes and modifications within. Therefore, the strategy is a moving plan that can and will adjust in order to be effective over its lifetime. Continue to tweak the plan as necessary and follow the guidelines in order to produce the best results possible.",
"As published by our co-founder, ""Native advertising is a form of paid media where the advertisement is relevant to the consumer experience, integrated into the surrounding content and is not disruptive."" The advertisement is in-feed and is relevant to the content on the page. As CEO of a native advertising platform, I'm seeing the native advertising industry experience phenomenal growth, especially on mobile.

When introducing native to your marketing campaign, you need a clear view of what you want the results to be. In order to succeed with your in-feed native ads, you first need to define what success actually looks like. What is the metric you are going to use to determine whether or not your native advertising is a success? For the majority of in-feed native advertising campaigns, key performance indicators (KPIs) typically fall into one or more of the below:

CTR: Click-through rates (CTRs) are often used as a KPI, particularly when it comes to programmatic native advertising.

Visits: Rightly or wrongly for many advertisers, the No. 1 criteria for success when they run native advertising campaigns is: How many visits did it bring to my site?

Dwell Time And Bounce Rate: These two KPIs often go hand in hand with visits as a measure of success. Dwell time is the measure of how long a visitor spends on a specific page, so it can be used -- in a slightly crude fashion -- as an indicator of whether someone read and enjoyed the content on the page.

Bounce rate, which is a key search metric, is the indication of what the user did after landing on the page. Did they click back or close the window, or was their interest piqued enough by this page to move along to other pages on the site? Both are metrics used to understand the stickiness of content and websites, and to tell if visitors enjoy these pages.

Engagement: This is a similar KPI to dwell time, but the process of measurement is very different. While dwell time is typically measured through the advertisers’ website, usually via Google Analytics, engagement is a metric that is usually measured via a publisher, native technology platform or another third-party ad-tracking tool.

What does it mean? It is a measure of how long someone engaged with your content. This could be how long, on average, someone spent reading your branded content published on a site. Or it could be the average length someone spent watching your brand video.

Shares And Likes: For many advertisers, native advertising is a tool to be used to generate shares of their content and likes for their pages. This is particularly true, though not exclusively, with social media advertising. For many advertisers using social media advertising, they are looking for as many shares of their content as possible -- shares that hopefully translate into lots of likes for their social media profiles, and more visitors to their site. But, ultimately, shares equal extended reach for your brand’s marketing messages and increase the available pool of relevant customers you can engage with at any point in the future.

Sales And Leads: While soft metrics, such as engagement and visits, are very popular measures of success, native advertising is increasingly being used as a pure direct response marketing channel. For these advertisers, success is easy to quantify: Did I create any sales leads? Did I manage to generate any sales as a result of this native advertising?

Sophisticated advertisers increasingly use native advertising in conjunction with other forms of digital advertising for strong sales results. When combined with data, retargeting, cookies and attribution modeling, native advertising is a growing part of the modern sales lead marketing mix.

The onset of native and content-based advertising solutions has presented the industry with a complex challenge: How do we establish meaningful and consistent measures that underpin the digital trading environment and allow the evaluation of campaign effectiveness?

Using standard metrics will give you the numbers you want -- the impressions, reach, clicks, etc. And through this, you will be able to show whether a native ad was successful compared to other advertising formats. However, I believe these serve as a reporting comparison but do not give full insight into the value of native advertising. How you measure a native ad should differ according to the campaign and its objectives and be tailored toward this.

In June 2016, the IAB U.K.’s Content and Native Council published its Content and Native Measurement Green Paper, in which our company weighed in, along with 15 other companies. If the paper has a conclusion, it's that there is much work to be done to be open and transparent with all data points for consistent, algorithmic measures and techniques to be developed.

The point on which everyone agreed is that current digital trading metrics were only a part of the solution and that, as with traditional media, there has to be an investment in understanding how people behave with content-based and native advertising before establishing algorithms that measure those behaviors.",
"Strong communication skills are a must for any leader, whether they are needed to manage employees, voice expectations and assign tasks, or to convince potential investors or partners to back an organization. A great leader must be able to properly communicate their thoughts and inspire people -- to the point where the success and growth of their business hinges in large part on their communication skills.

These seven entrepreneurs share what they believe to be the most important communication secrets of leadership, and how mastering them can make you a better leader.

And making an effort to become a better listener has definitely paid off for her business. She adds, ""I had to change my communication strategy a few years ago to be more cognizant of listening to clients, not just speaking -- which I had thought was the best way to win clients. This strategy has revolutionized my business and I recommend it to new entrepreneurs.""

When communicating, paying attention to nonverbal cues is essential, according to SeedProd LLC Founder John Turner: ""Body language is very important to successful communication. The people you speak to will be more open to you and your message if your body language is warm and accepting.""

Turner believes people should become more aware of their body language and make a conscientious effort to improve it, as well as learn to read others' correctly. ""Smile more, make eye contact, don't cross your arms, etc. Pay attention to the other person's body language, too. You'll be able to tell how they feel during the conversation and can shift the conversation accordingly,"" he explains.

""Stories that make us feel stick around in our lives much longer than anything else,"" she says. ""When I'm vulnerable and willing to share my stories, especially the ones of hard times and how I moved past them, it inspires people to push past their obstacles and keep moving toward their goals.""

Connecting with the people you're trying to lead is indeed of crucial importance, Passport Co-Founder and COO Aaron Schwartz agrees. ""No matter how much charisma you have or how good of a listener you are, the real impact is when you connect deeply with everyone you're trying to lead,"" he says.

And the best communication secret, in Schwartz's opinion, is ""that you have to get to know everyone you're trying to lead, and change what you say and how you say it based on the audience.""

""As a leader of a small group, I've found that the best way to communicate with my staff is to show them genuine kindness and fairness. I strive to treat everyone the same, which helps build trust and positive relationships,"" Marquet says.

To further improve their communication skills, good leaders should actively seek feedback from others. ""Just as it is said that the best apology is changed behavior, the best communication secret of great leaders is asking for feedback, then implementing it,"" reveals Zev Herman, president of Superior Lighting.

""We recently had employees communicate that our office is too noisy on client-heavy days, and they need quiet to focus and concentrate. We agreed to try out a work-from-home schedule planned ahead of time to accommodate this productivity concern,"" Herman explains.

One of the most powerful ways to achieve this, Faerman believes, is by understanding universal human needs and behavioral drivers and then appealing to these themes in your communication: ""Frame your message in terms of how it will help people achieve their needs for connection, happiness, security and success, and you'll be able to lead nations.""",
"Who are Britain’s fastest-growing and most exciting small and medium-sized enterprises? All sorts of organisations have tried to answer that question, compiling rankings of top-performing businesses in order to separate the wheat from the chaff. But each list produces different winners – which is what you would expect given that they’re selected and organised according to different criteria.

Indeed, Beauhurst, the market research company that specialises in tracking fast-growing companies, says it has identified no fewer than 5,500 companies that have featured on 19 separate lists of high-growth companies in recent times. That’s quite a number given that the aim of this game is supposed to be to identify the select few companies with the brightest prospects.

You can pick your list to suit your tastes, of course. The compilers' approaches are very different. For example, the Fastrack 100 ranking, backed by the Sunday Times, simply picks out the privately-owned companies with the fastest growing sales over the past three years. Elsewhere, the Leap 100 list uses a panel of experts to identify impressive companies using a more subjective range of criteria.

No one ranking is necessarily better than any other – they’re attempting to do very different things, rather than to compete. In some cases, the rankings just confine themselves to considering companies in a particular sector. In others, the idea is to find promising companies even before they’ve begun delivering significant revenues, let alone profitability.

Still, what would happen if you were able to average out all these rankings in some way? Well, that’s what Beauhurst has now done. It’s looked across the 19 lists of high-growth companies to find out which ones appear most often. Each of the top nine companies selected on this basis appear on at least seven different rankings – and the top one appears on nine occasions.

The full list is below, but there are a couple of points worth noting. First, the UK’s burgeoning fintech sector is remarkably well-represented: four out of the 10 businesses who make the list are fintechs, including the top two, which both come from the same niche. But second, it’s also only fair to point out that this ranking of rankings actually produces a decent spread of businesses, with representatives from marketing, logistics and the gambling sector as well as the more obvious contenders from fintech.

Are these businesses guaranteed to grow more quickly than other young British companies in the years ahead? Clearly not, but their consistent ability to make it into rankings that assess different attributes suggests their prospects are extremely bright. Some are already making significant profits and all are growing at a very rapid rate - at least some of these companies look set to become household names in the not too distant future.",
"Adhering to the mantra, “if you want something done, do it yourself,” New York City real estate developer Barbara van Beuren positioned herself at the helm one of the city’s most prominent firms.

With a background in architecture, van Beuren grew her areas of expertise from aesthetics and materials to procuring money for ground-up projects and the management of the many professionals needed for building construction. She now oversees acquisitions, marketing and design at Anbau Enterprises, a development company founded by her husband, Stephen Glascock, in 1998.

Included in Anbau’s recent portfolio is Citizen360 at 360 E. 89th St. in Yorkville, which in the first half of 2018 was among the top-selling luxury buildings on the Upper East Side. But while architecture and brokering are popular career choices for women, real estate development, especially on the commercial side, has been historically dominated by men. I asked van Beuren about her hunger for a seat at the table and what she thinks women in particular can bring to it.

How did you start your career?

I’m an architect by training and I met my husband and my business partner in grad school, and after grad school we got licensed. You know, you go and you work in architecture firms and you do work for developers, and it became pretty clear pretty quickly that if you wanted to build the buildings you wanted to build, you had to control the money. It all starts with the money. So we started slowly and we bought a small loft build in Chelsea almost 20 years ago and we renovated that, we started doing one building at a time, and by 2007 we had completed our first new construction building. And then 2008 hit - but since then we’ve only done ground-up and we’ve never looked back.

Do you agree that real estate development is a male-dominated industry?

There are plenty of women in the real estate field in New York, but there are not many female developers. Women dominate residential brokerages, sales and marketing, design, but there’s no doubt that men completely dominate the commercial side of things. The developer role is highly speculative. A developer is defined by somebody who is building new commercial or residential space, they’re actually building things that didn’t exist before, and they’re doing that with debt and they have to convince people to lend them the money.

Why are there less women in the commercial sector?

People like deals. We [at Anbau] are not deal junkies. Women tend to focus on the residential side because, I guess, they’re working with places you live in and homes, and men seem to transact on the commercial side. For me, the thing about cash-flow is it’s less related to design, it’s all about underwriting and numbers. I always found it fascinating that the majority of people who are in the real estate business on the brokerage side and the ownership side, it’s never about what the building looks like, it’s always about the cash flow. And yet real estate means buildings. It’s so odd to me because I’m an architect. I think that has less to do with the fact that I’m female and more do to with my background.

Is your experience different when you’re working with men vs. women?

Women always bring a different perspective to the table. I think women are better (not always) at working in teams, and often they’re more likely to be consensus-builders. In the beginning I was the only woman in our office, today we’re about 50/50, and I think that it makes this office more productive, more well-rounded, a much nicer place to live and work. Generally, you put a woman in the room in a lot of these negotiations, especially with contractors, and everyone behaves, so the whole level of dialogue becomes much more respectful and much less testosteroned. It’s that ego-thing again. I think women are much more pragmatic, often, and that the field could really use a little leveling - a little more humanity. Even in the press.

How do you keep from feeling intimidated during negotiations?

What always changes the dialogue is, who controls the money? If you’re the one who controls the money then people are much nicer to you. I’ve had contactors at times really give me a hard time and I just turn around and give it right back to them and it shuts them up - but part of the reason I’m able to do that is because I know the language, I know the process, I hold the checkbook and all those sorts of things. And I can get them fired.

If readers aspire to become real estate developers, what should they do first?

The thing about real estate development is that you have to wear many hats. You can’t be good at everything, but you have to know and feel confident that the decisions you’re making are good ones and are not just financial decisions. You’re making decisions about management, design - you have to know how to manage a contractor, you have to know how not to get walked all over. You need to know how to raise money. There are so many things that you need to know, and you can’t know it all which is why being a good team builder is really important. I think you start out with the things that you’re good at and you pursue one of those. You can enter development through all sorts of avenues - the brokerage side, the design side, the asset management side. You have to learn how to express ideas in multiple ways, and you just have to start working.",
"This is probably not advice most adult humans need to hear -- from what I can tell, most do it naturally. I, however, do not. I'm not a kid person. I'm not a pet person. I'm not even a plant person. I won't hesitate to tell you I'm not interested in learning the secret ingredient in the cookies you brought to the office. I will absolutely never try to bake them for myself.

I prefer my work to most things. And when I'm not working for my day job as an editor, my main hobby is my side hustle... as an editor. Or freelance writing. Or something fun like blogging about composition. Or reading about how to write better.

So when I became a manager for the first time, I needed to be reminded of this thing normal people seem to do naturally: You have to ask people about their kids.

They have houses with plumbing issues, families who take trips to Europe, dogs who have to be house-trained; and kids with school events, dentist appointments, broken arms; and germs that make them sick, then make the whole school sick, then make the whole household sick, then make the whole office sick...

We have to learn to roll with it. It's not OK to step in as manager and expect them to forget every important thing in their lives because you prefer work to the pitter patter of little feet (or paws).

Instead of greeting team members each morning with a rundown of expectations for the day, and giving them demerits when the flu and leaky pipes unravel their plans, here are a few quick ways to help them excel in their roles while having a life outside of work (even if you don't want one).

1. Ask about their kids.

Start the day with this reminder from my partner. If they don't have kids, swap in pets, hobbies, cars, TV shows -- whatever gets them excited that's not work. Ask about plans for the weekend, and listen when they reply. Follow up on Monday.

Another pro tip: Write stuff down (including the kids' names). If you tend to forget small talk immediately because of the zillion things on your to-do list, jot a few notes to commit your conversations to memory.

2. Let them set their schedule.

If your employees have to choose between doing good work and picking up kids from school every day, good work will probably lose out whether they sacrifice the latter or not.

Help your employees by asking them what they need to work around and figuring out together how to make it fit.

This doesn't mean letting performance slide or even letting them come and go as they please. Instead, ask them what is the best time for them to come in each morning and leave in the afternoon or when you might expect them to make up a few hours from home in the evening or on weekends.

Instead, create an environment where they can do work they're proud of and tap into the creativity or other skills that help them blow off steam. And occasionally ask how they're doing. They'll probably be grateful for your neutral ear. (Just don't let yourself become their therapist.)",
"""When I started this, I had people tell me I had to get out of Austin and move to L.A. or New York City to be a legitimate fashion brand,"" remembers Kendra Scott. ""But something in my gut told me to stay."" Smart move: Scott's eponymous jewelry and lifestyle company is now valued at $1 billion, and she still owns a majority stake.

That kind of success was unimaginable for Scott as recently as 2009, when the financial crisis almost killed her company. She founded the business in 2002, designing jewelry out of her spare bedroom and toting her 3-month-old to local boutiques to persuade them to carry her accessibly priced statement earrings. Eventually, she had distribution in mostly independent stores around the country--until the bottom fell out of the economy and many of those businesses shuttered. Even at her major retail partners, buyers were getting laid off or canceling orders. ""Business went down 40 percent in a year,"" she says. ""It was chaos.""

Desperate for a way forward--and, at the time, recently divorced with two small children--Scott decided to make the least logical bet: open her own store. She decided if she was going to build a brand, she needed to forge a direct relationship with her customers, both in person and online. But bank after bank rejected her for a loan, until Texas Capital took a chance on her. ""I will always bank with them,"" Scott says now. ""They looked at me not as a loan number but as a human.""

Scott opened her store on Austin's South Congress Avenue, the city's hippest shopping strip. But it was different from other jewelry stores, which she generally found creepy, with their locked glass-enclosed cases and hovering security guards. ""I hated going into jewelry stores,"" she says. ""I wanted customers to engage with the product and have fun, to touch and feel the pieces and try them on, like how we shop for clothes."" So she did away with the typical trappings, instead creating a Color Bar, where shoppers could mix and match materials to personalize their pieces, while sipping champagne.

If Scott's first store proved her retail prescience, her second store gave her a lesson in staying authentic to her Austin roots. In 2011, Scott debuted her second location on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, only to discover that no one there knew or cared about her brand. The store flopped, and she decided to open her next store back in Texas. When Scott raised her first round of venture capital in 2014, she doubled down on opening stores around the South and the Midwest, catering to a multigenerational clientele that the fashion elite in New York and Los Angeles largely ignored. ""Being away from those big cities gave me a unique perspective on what was happening in fashion, and then I put my own spin on it,"" says Scott.

In late 2016, Scott sold a large minority stake of her company to the private equity firm Berkshire Partners, at a valuation of $1 billion. By then, having established her brand on its own terms, she was ready to storm the coasts and beyond. She now has a thriving e-commerce operation and 92 stores, including a shop inside the London luxury department store Selfridges, and her first New York City outpost, a 1,700-square-foot store in SoHo.

But Scott gives as much credit for the growth that followed her original store to the mutually supportive business community in Austin. Just as local boutiques had given her a start and Texas Capital had given her a lifeline, other entrepreneurs in Austin stepped in as mentors. Clayton Christopher, who created and sold both Sweet Leaf Tea and Deep Eddy Vodka, advised Scott when she took her first equity investment. Steve Hicks, a radio entrepreneur, was her first investor. Now Scott invests in and advises younger companies in Austin, such as Helm Boots and Darbie Angell dinnerware. Austin, she says, has kept a kind of outsider mentality, and that has spurred the city's entrepreneurs to band together. ""The way we see it, we are not competing with each other but competing against the world,"" she says. ""So why not lift each other up?""",None
"You work hard. You work long. You give your all to building your business, serving your customers, creating a future for your employees. That means you're in it for the long haul.

Speaking of the long haul: With all the advances in medicine, nutrition, and science, in terms of life expectancy, where do you think the U.S. ranks compared to the rest of the world?

And it gets worse. By 2040, researchers predict the U.S. will have fallen to 64th in the world.

In a study 34-year study of more than 100,000 people, the researchers determined there are five factors that contribute most to living longer:

The list contains no surprises -- but does lead to a surprising conclusion. Based on the data, say you...

Do those things and compared to people who don't meet any of those criteria, if you're a woman your life expectancy improves from 79 to 93.1 years old. If you're a man, your life expectancy increases from 75.5 to 87.6 years old.

While such a sizable difference in life expectancy might seem farfetched, think about it this way. The top five determinants of average lifespan are ""lifestyle"" diseases: Obesity, high blood pressure, elevated blood sugar, and alcohol and tobacco use.

Take body weight: Being overweight or obese is linked to serious health consequences like heart disease and stroke, Type 2 diabetes, and even some forms of cancer.

That's why the people who met the five criteria were 82 percent less likely than those who did not to die from cardiovascular disease and 65 percent less likely to die from cancer.

So if you want to live longer -- and who doesn't? -- the path is simple.

Simple, yet hard. Anyone who tries to tell you that eating right, exercising regularly, and maintaining a healthy body weight is easy... is either lying, or trying to sell you something.

But you definitely can do it -- especially since the payoff, both short- and long-term, is so huge.

If you're overweight, start eating healthier. Start exercising more. That will actually knock three items off the list, since the combination of a better diet and more exercise will also reduce your body fat percentage.

Then keep your alcohol intake moderate. (It's okay to exceed the limit once in a while; the goal is to stay at or below an average of the equivalent of one or two glasses of wine.)  And do everything you possibly can to stop smoking.

Keep in mind that even if you don't meet all five criteria, meeting a few will still pay off. Researchers found a ""dose-response relationship"" between each individual healthy lifestyle behavior and a reduced risk of early death. Iin non researcher-speak, that means any lifestyle improvements you make will positively impact your life expectancy.",
"The holiday season is a time for family gatherings, parties, gift exchanges, good food, and celebration--and that can be a problem. The many expectations and responsibilities placed on us during this time can be a major source of stress, anxiety, depression, and loneliness.

On top of that, those of us who live in the northern hemisphere may be susceptible to seasonal affective disorder (SAD), when the reduced sunshine, shorter days, and cold weather can affect our mental health. And if you're grieving a major loss this year, the holidays can be especially painful.

If, as the end of the year approaches, you feel your blood pressure rising or your mood falling, here are some simple practices that can help you get through the holidays.

1. Keep your expectations in check.

If your day-to-day life already causes you enough stress, then it's important to keep your own expectations for the holidays manageable. If you're not able to do everything you want to do or you're not able to afford everything you want to buy, that's perfectly fine.

Despite what we tell ourselves, there is no such thing as the perfect holiday season. Keeping things simple--like getting takeout or ordering all your Christmas presents online--may actually help you enjoy the holidays more.

The reality is that others probably won't notice if you take some shortcuts or keep things simple. Most important is your own contentment with setting limits.

2. It's okay to say no.

We may feel a lot of pressure to do certain things or act a certain way around the holidays. Sometimes the best thing you can do for yourself is to say no to the expectation of others.

Don't want to throw that holiday party that your family and friends expect? That's fine. Do you want to spend time with one or two close loved ones instead of attending big gatherings? That's okay too. Would you rather give small, meaningful presents rather than big, expensive ones? That's a very reasonable option.

You don't have to celebrate the holidays a particular way, and you certainly don't have to celebrate it the way others want you to. It's okay to find your own meaningful ways of marking the season--and you'll find that most everyone will be okay with that too.

Self-care should be a regular part of your routine at any time of year, but during this season, when there is so much external pressure to do certain things, it's especially critical. It's such a busy time of year that you may even want to block out time in your calendar for self-care.

Make sure to engage in activities that nourish your soul, whether it's reading, exercising, spending time with a close friend, or getting away for the weekend. If you're susceptible to SAD, being outside (even if it's freezing) and getting some sunlight exposure are also important for your well-being.

4. Be kind to others.

You can volunteer at a local community organization for a few hours, donate to your favorite charity, pass out snacks to strangers on the street, or simply offer a smile and kind word to those you encounter. If you know someone who is grieving at this time, bring them a meal or simply sit with them in their sorrow.",
"Holiday shopping is up almost 20%, according to Adobe Analytics data, which tracks transactions for 80 of the top 100 U.S. online retailers. As of yesterday, it hit a record $80.3 billion.

That's $13 billion more than last year.

But more interesting to me? Who's doing all that shopping and shipping.

In perhaps a throwaway phrase, Adobe says the ""top states by basket size were Alaska, California, Washington, New York and Wyoming.""

That's interesting, for two different reasons.

We know California, New York, and Washington are among the wealthier states, and we know how wealthier Americans are more and more likely to order online (or, increasingly, by app) and get delivery at home, especially by subscription and monthly deliveries.

But the contrast between those states and the other order size leaders are immense.

Alaska and Wyoming are both lightly populated, highly dispersed states with limited access to bricks-and-mortar retail. It's easier to order online -- and order a lot -- and get delivery at home rather than driving for hours to the nearest mall. Or, in some cases, flying or boating to a nearby population center.

So online order cart sizes are growing, with Alaska the highest in the country at $166, followed by California, Washington, and New York at $165, $160, and $160, respectively. Wyoming was just behind, at $158. (Higher shipping costs to Alaska were another driver of buyers consolidating orders to minimize costs, says Adobe.)

Increasingly, this e-commerce is mobile, with 55% year-over-year growth in sales on mobile.

“Retailers are reaping the rewards of their investments in mobile,"" says Taylor Schreiner, director of Adobe Digital Insights. ""So far this season, we see $8.4 billion more dollars coming from smartphones versus last year, compared to $3.8 billion more dollars coming from desktop computers compared to last year.""

The retail extravaganza is likely to continue.

20% of U.S. shoppers plan to do more than three quarters of their holiday shopping at big online retailers like Amazon and eBay, says Adobe. That's up 25% from last year.

And e-commerce is simply the new Sears catalogue: all the world's products available wherever you happen to be.",
"In 1967, Georgia businessman S. Truett Cathy founded the very first Chick-fil-A fast-food restaurant in Atlanta's Greenbriar Shopping Center. Famous for its chicken sandwiches -- and for its policy of closing for business on Sundays -- Chick-fil-A has grown into a wildly successful chain of more than 2,100 restaurants in 46 states and the District of Columbia.

Ten years ago, I had the good fortune to interview S. Truett Cathy along with Kansas City business icon Bert Berkley for our book, Giving Back. During the course of our interview, Cathy -- who passed away in 2014 at the age of 93 -- revealed the secrets to his own considerable success in both business and life.

S. Truett Cathy: I was born in poverty. My mother was the breadwinner, and it was at an early age that she opened a boarding house. We furnished a bed in a room and charged a dollar a day -- $7 a week -- for room and board. And I learned how to shuck corn and shell peas and wash dishes and set the table. I belong to the First Baptist Church of Jonesboro, Georgia. My pastor asked, ""What did Jesus say that few people believe?"" The answer was simply that it is better to give than to receive. There are very few people who have found this out. It seems to me like the more I give, the more I have.

S. Truett Cathy: Throughout my business life. I've been in business for over 61 years -- in 2006, I celebrated my 60th year in the restaurant business at the same location. I don't know of anybody who has been in business anyplace for that length of time. I've been in the restaurant business serving the physical and emotional needs of people, and oftentimes their spiritual needs. I feel like it's a high calling to have that position of furnishing the essentials of life, and not just food, itself...I started out at eight years old buying Cokes, six for a quarter, and selling them for a nickel apiece and recognizing a 5-cent profit. A full case of Coca-Cola was 24 Cokes for 80 cents; you sell 24 Cokes for 5 cents apiece, and you made yourself 40 cents. To me, that was big business. From there, I sold magazines, and I got a paper route. I would tell my people if they would get their paper from me, I would put it by the screen door or put it up on the porch. I would be there rain or shine. I was a pretty good salesman in that period of time. Then I had a gift for buying something wholesale and selling it retail.

S. Truett Cathy: The most positive were my mom, my wife, and the Sunday school teacher I had when I was a teenager. He was very kind to me and he was a role model for me. He helped me with my papers on Sunday morning. My dad was not the kind of father that I could go to when I had a problem. He was there, and that's about the only contact I had with him. We're still a private company, and I intend to stay that way. We give out a lot of things we couldn't do if we were a public company. We have a scholarship program for our part-time team members, where we give them $1,000 scholarships if they work for us for two years. Our average work schedule is 20 hours a week. We've devoted $40 million toward that, and the other scholarship programs we have. We have a boy's camp and a girl's camp, and I have 12 foster homes where we try to identify those kids who do not have any serious behavior problems, just victims of circumstances.

S. Truett Cathy: The most significant thing I think would be the example I have tried to set for other people, even with our family, that I tried to not dictate, but demonstrate what I'm trying to say and what I'm trying to do. I have a moral and corporate compass to glorify God by being a faithful steward. That means to give back a portion of God's blessings to others, and to help the people we come in contact with.

S. Truett Cathy: I like J.B. Fuqua -- he has been very generous. He once told me, ""Truett, it seems like the more money I give, the more I have."" He has given away more than $150 million for various causes. He doesn't seem to get involved in it, but he's done a lot of good things. He was also a great benefactor.",
"Who exactly is Ted Baker? The website provides a clue:

In reality, the enigmatic 'Ted' is the creation of Founder & CEO Ray Kelvin - his alter ego if you will. Today, the irreverent sense of humor, so typified by the brand, is being tested to the max.

Over the past week yet more and more lurid allegations of inappropriate behavior on the part of Kelvin, have emerged. Stories not just of 'forced hugging' but of being 'pinned to a wall' by one employee who was guilty of not inviting Kelvin to his wedding.

Another emerged in The Sunday Times this week of a female employee approached by a 'grunting' Kelvin, who subsequently climbed on top of her whilst wearing a Halloween mask.

Not everyone's idea of appropriate behavior in the workplace.

The Ted Baker Board have been swift to advise that a full independent inquiry (were they somehow expecting to have to take this action?) will be undertaken by law firm Herbert Smith Freehills; in the meantime, Kelvin has taken a 'voluntary leave of absence'.

But it seems that staff at Ted Baker are not alone.

According to Organise, a start-up workplace campaigns site, at the Co-op staff have begun a petition against one on one shifts which they claim are inherently unsafe whilst staff at River Island have campaigned for workplace flexibility and the right to swap shifts.

Following the recent reports in The Telegraph of inappropriate behavior of 'a sexist and racist nature' at Arcadia by its boss Sir Philip Green, is this the tip of the iceberg?

Does retail need to clean up its act? Has it become an industry riddled with alpha male bosses, and a hotbed of bullying, harassment, and racism?

Has 'old retail' finally been found out? Caught up in corporate inflexibility and outdated KPI's, are we witnessing the death throes of businesses hopelessly wedded to the past?

As the sector faces the toughest times it has ever experienced and the prospect of a very bleak Christmas on the High Street, perhaps the time has come for the new breed of modern retailers to move center stage.

Just what exactly the culture has been like at Ted Baker over the last few decades is, of course, open to conjecture but one thing is becoming abundantly clear: in this era of #MeToo, corporate behavior is under the fiercest scrutiny.",
"It's never going to go away. It's that infamous embarrassing moment that marks an NFL career that certainly has higher highlights than a turnover off of a teammate's posterior.

Mark Sanchez has to live with this. Forget the trips to the AFC Championship game. Forget being the No. 5 overall pick. Forget the Rose Bowl win and the top-five finish at USC. This quarterback's football life has been distilled down to a single blooper-reel play.

On Thanksgiving night in 2012, playing for the New York Jets, a team he had twice led to within a game of the Super Bowl, Sanchez took the snap from center. The trouble started when he missed the handoff. The play was busted. For a moment, he stared down the field. He ran toward the line of scrimmage. He tried to make something out of nothing. He ran into his teammate's backside and lost the ball. New England Patriots defensive back Steve Gregory scooped up the loose ball and raced it into the end zone for a touchdown. That's 98 words to describe it. Most people use two: butt fumble.

That's what follows Sanchez. The play even has its own Wikipedia page. It's been watched nearly 1.4 million times.

Since that play, Sanchez has been signed by five other NFL teams. His latest team is Washington where he is starting for the playoff contender after injuries decimated the team's quarterback corps.

Of course in his meeting with the media the butt fumble came up. How he handled it is worth taking note. People know this. They have watched his response more than 1.1 million times.

Here's what there is to take away from Sanchez's response:",
"If you're like most leaders, you want your company to grow faster and to have fun doing it. What might surprise you is that the youngest professor ever to win full tenure at Harvard Business School says you can achieve these twin aims simultaneously.

The professor in question is Francesca Gino, the Tandon Family Professor of Business Administration at Harvard Business School. Her book Rebel Talent is among 2018's best business books. Gino's basic premise is that rebels -- people who consciously don't follow the rules, or have great difficulty doing so -- are good for business.

As she explains in her book, rebels reject the idea that there are limits on what they can achieve. And they act in peculiar ways to reach their aims -- they ""break, transform, and create.""

By their very definition, rebels represent a threat to a leader who has a command-and-control mentality. Such leaders issue commands to their workers and reward the people who carry out those commands the most effectively. If you are such a leader, it seems to me that you'll have trouble hiring rebels and letting them do their thing.

Companies that encourage rebel talent -- who share five traits: novelty, curiosity, perspective, diversity, and authenticity -- achieve better outcomes. For instance, Gino cites studies that tie novelty to engagement at work. A case in point is Pal's Sudden Service, a burger chain in Tennessee and Virginia known for fast service and low turnover, where employees are continually challenged to do new tasks.

It has long puzzled me why leaders hire talented people and try to squelch their creativity. Leaders do this in overt and subtle ways.

In the extreme, they fire or sideline people who disagree with their decisions. More subtly, they encourage people to come up with creative solutions and then ignore their ideas.

If you want the benefits of rebel talent, you have to commit to leading an organization that is looking to win -- by offering up the industry's best solutions to customer problems. Once you agree to that, you should also recognize an important corollary: You don't need to be the only one coming up with new ideas.

2. Go back to the fundamentals.

How can you lead your rebel talent to develop such new ideas? For starters, you should push your people to know more than anyone else. Ask them to investigate customers' most annoying unsolved problems, what technologies are emerging to solve them, and how upstarts are tackling these challenges.

Then, encourage them to come up with new ideas. Ask probing questions when they present their solutions. Open up the discussion to everyone in your organization to develop the best solutions.",
"Most organizations have some type of celebration in honor of the holiday season. It may be as simple as an employee breakfast or lunch or a more elaborate event after working hours that might include alcohol, food and entertainment. Some companies don’t have an “event,” but there may still be an exchange of gifts. Gifts? The pressure is on. You want to get the right gift. One that is appropriate. One that is appreciated. Well, if you’re wondering what holiday gift to give your employees, your co-workers or your boss, then this is the article you want to read.

To start with, just last week I wrote an article on the Top Ten Business Books of 2018. If you want to give a safe and politically correct gift, consider one of these excellent books. Inscribing the book with a personal message makes the gift more meaningful.

But, if a book isn’t what you want to give, then consider the results just released from Instantprint’s survey of 1,500 office workers who were asked what they would want from their employer:

The survey digs into more detail. Different departments prefer different types of gifts. IT professionals seem to want to get off work earlier than others. 35% of them said they would prefer getting off work early, versus the overall average of 29%. 10% of executives would appreciate a donation made in their name, versus 7% of the entire group. Some of these gifts can be more personal, one-to-one gifts, while others are more appropriate for the company to give a group of employees (or all employees).

The survey also looked at the worst gifts:

James Kinsella, CEO and co-founder of Instantprint says, “Something as simple as an early finish, free bar at a party or a Christmas gift voucher can make employees feel valued and appreciated. This, in turn, can help boost employee morale, loyalty and productivity in the workplace.”

John Ruhlin, author of Giftology and considered to be one of the foremost authorities on corporate gift-giving, has a lot to say about holiday gifts. While there are exceptions to every rule, Ruhlin has a strong opinion about gifts that many might think are acceptable:

Commenting on the Instantprint survey, Ruhlin says, “The reason employees want an open bar at the holiday party or a gift card is that employers have set the bar low with bad gifts. It’s hard to screw up a gift card.”

The best gifts according to Ruhlin are gifts that can be enjoyed together with the family or spouse/partner. A gift that extends beyond the holidays, that’s not consumable, is also appreciated. For example, Ruhlin loves sending engraved kitchen knives. The engraving is not the company’s logo, but a personalized message, such as: Handcrafted Exclusively for Shep and Cindy Hyken. (That’s what it says on the large butcher knife Ruhlin gave us last year.)

Give a gift that shows you put a little thought into it. Ruhlin also adds, “If you really want to show appreciation to people you work with, consider gifts during other times of the year. The holiday gift for employees is like giving your spouse or partner a Valentine’s Day gift. It’s expected and given out of obligation.”",
"I've become suspicious of self-help tactics, not because they don't work but because few people have the discipline to execute them. For example, the concept of ""sharpen the saw"" (from The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People) is excellent advice... that probably 1% of readers of that book actually turn into a habit.

Behaviors that become habits are generally both easy to execute and have an immediate pleasurable payback. That's why people become so easily addicted to drugs, TV or video games. By contrast, ""sharpen the saw"" neither easy to do (it's hard work!) nor particularly pleasurable; hence it's a substantial challenge to make it habitual.

Most of the habits that can be acquired easily have either a negative effect (like drugs) or a neutral effect (like TV) on your life and career. Habits that create positive, long-term change (but are easy to acquire) are rarer, so rare, in fact, that most people are pressed to name even a single example.

Consider your mental process when you see another person whom you don't immediately recognize. Your first thought is automatic because it's genetically programed into your brain. It is the question ""friend, foe, or neither?""

If your brain tells you that the person is a (potential) friend, you might approach them. If your brain tells you that the person is a foe (potential or otherwise), you go into ""fight or flight"" stance. But most of the time, your brain says ""neither,"" because most of the strangers you see simply aren't immediately relevant to your world.

The thoughts you have in the third (and most common) case determine, in many ways, how you feel about people in general. Most of the time, you simply dismiss them from your mind. However, it's also very common for people to immediately formulate a criticism of the other person, like ""he's fat"" or ""what a loser"" or ""what an ugly hat"" or whatever.

The problem with such uncharitable thoughts is that they create a sourness in your attitude when dealing with other people. It's very much like suffering from a negative internal dialog; if you keep thinking ""I'm stupid"" you do stupid things.

Similarly, if you continually criticize other people (even if only in your mind), you start treating other people poorly. To make matters worse, other people intuitively sense your negative attitude and respond by treating you poorly. It creates a self-reinforcing cycle that makes you, and everyone around you, more miserable.

For example, while driving down the street you see a homeless person. You immediately realize ""not a threat"" and then either ignore him or, worse, judge him or her.

If instead you think something like ""gee, I hope he's all right"" or even ""I'll bet there's a story there,"" you're training your mind to think the best of people... even people you'll never meet. This attitude quickly permeates your interactions with people whom you DO meet. People will sense that you're a kind who wants the best for other people. You'll treat them better and they'll treat you better.

As I mentioned earlier, this habit is extremely easy to acquire because 1) it's very easy and 2) it has an immediate payback, which is that you'll feel better about yourself.

Next time you're in a public space or around a lot of people, set the timer on your watch or phone to 10 minutes. During that time think a kind thought about everyone you see.  You will be surprised at how more positive about yourself and others you'll feel at the end of that 10 minutes. What's more, it's likely you'll enjoy it so much that you'll find yourself doing it automatically, going forward.

I can say without reservation that acquiring this habit has changed my life for the better. I used to be hyper-critical of other people and the attitude it created in me both made me miserable and, frankly, a bit insufferable. However, since I changed my automatic thoughts about other people to consistently kind, I've been much happier dealing with other people and people treat me better as well.",
"January 13th will mark a year since the Open Banking reforms were brought in, allowing banks to open their data to third-parties for the first time. This initiative aims to incite greater competition in the UK’s banking sector, encourage new product development, bring in new disruptive players, and provide consumers with more choice and better deals. However, in order for wider adoption, a change in culture and consumer attitudes needs to take place and the FinTech sector needs to show proof of success, establish trust, and offer reassurance around security of data.

Open Banking regulations require big banks to permit their customers to share their own transaction data with third parties, which is made possible through application programming interfaces or APIs. These APIs allow software at one company to have access to information from another. In order to make use of bank APIs, companies are required to have authorization from the UK regulator as Account Information Service Providers (AISPs), proving compliance with regulations including keeping data secure and only using access to provide their stated service.

What has happened so far?

So far, 67 firms are using Open Banking and, according to the Open Banking Implementation Entity (OBIE), the technology was used 3 million times in July, up from 2 million usages in June – clearly indicating that the number of financial services beginning to engage with API integration is growing.

HSBC’s Connected Money app, which lets customers view their accounts at up to 21 different banks in one place, reflects the way banks are starting to capitalize on the reforms. FinTech companies are beginning to challenge the natural banking order, leading to more competition and a faster pace of innovation at traditional banks.

Innovation from the convergence of technology and financial services in the payments sector has so far been explosive, with paytechs and challenger banks generating a refreshed interest in the payments space. Historically, innovation of the UK’s banking payment systems only occurred at the pace of industry-wide schemes and was controlled by only a few select players.

Open Banking has yet to experience full adoption, as some banks are taking time to deal with potential compliance issues and haven’t taken full advantage of the changes in legislation. Some experts believe it’s not in the banks’ interest to promote open banking, since they see themselves as having to give away a large amount of valuable data to third-party providers while receiving little in return. As a result, many established banks are not being proactive in embracing new technologies.

There is also resistance on the consumer side, with people concerned about sharing their data following the Cambridge Analytica scandal and growing panic regarding the use of data, as well as a failure to see a significant benefit. Nevertheless, PWC predicts 71 per cent of SMEs and 64 per cent of adults will adopt open banking by 2022, forecasting consistent adoption of Open Banking technology across the financial services sector.

What will the impact be?

For small businesses, access to real-time customer data has the potential to be transformational. The funding application process is easier, faster and fairer whilst having less of an administrative burden when applying for finance. They can also receive from lenders faster with help tailored to the specific needs of each business.

For consumers, Open Banking changes will mean customers have a holistic view of all their financial behavior for the first time, making it easier to manage and control their finances. New apps can collate and analyze data for people, providing them with the know how of when and where cutting back on expenses is needed. Being able to pay through single-clicks and contactless cards means it is otherwise hard for consumers to keep on top of spending.

While Open Banking won’t destroy traditional banking, it will instead give customers more power to switch providers and pick products, meaning banks will face more competition from user-friendly rivals, from tech-giants to well-known consumer service companies with good customer relationships such as major supermarkets or retailers.

Ultimately, banks will be competing in terms of customer experience, meaning established players will need to embrace change as they face competition from challenger banks. They will need to improve customer experiences and relationships and embrace innovation. While established banks are dragging behind FinTech companies, the future will depend on which banks and FinTechs have invested successfully and established themselves as the most customer-centric.

Instead of tolling the death knell for banks, Open Banking represents a significant opportunity to innovate and transform core services. Once a few strong propositions find success, consumers will come on board in droves, and Open Banking will take off properly. With PWC estimating a £7.2 billion revenue opportunity created by Open Banking by 2022, it’s clear that banks, in order to fully harness the benefits, need to embrace the new regulations and view them as an opportunity instead of a threat. Applying these new technologies can enhance all banks’ capabilities and deliver for increasingly tech-savvy consumers.",None
"As a leader, your goal is to accomplish tasks through people, so there are always two dynamics involved: the task and the relationship. This is the second installation in a three-part series walking you through the idea of leadership instead of management and the challenges I had shifting to it.

When I first jumped into leadership, I was far too focused on the task. I thought that everyone wanted to be successful and if I gave them my playbook and they followed it exactly, they would have the same success as I did. I was wrong. I didn’t take into account how much the relationship mattered, and that it is half the equation of being a great leader.

I have learned that the key to becoming a great leader is accomplishing the task while successfully building relationships. It is a balancing act that is extremely delicate, but it can be refined with time. This is still something that I struggle with today, and I have to be continuously cognizant of it. I fail at emulating great leadership all the time, but I find that it's OK to fail because this is a continuous process that has its ups and downs. We are all human, and we all have our good and bad days — the goal is to limit the bad ones.

The foundation of this relationship is based on trust. So, how do we go about building trust? It comes from acts of selflessness, removing barriers in front of your employees so they can be successful, the willingness to sacrifice your owns wants and needs so they can achieve their goals, being committed to your employees, caring about their progress and goals and most importantly, listening to them and empathizing with them.

I once had an associate who had done incredibly well in his life. He had never failed at anything he had ever done, including getting into an Ivy League school — until he started in sales. His first three months were terrible. He couldn't sell a deal to save his life. It would have been easy to yell at him and put him down, but I remained patient with him and coached him diligently, building trust in the process. He knew that I would go to the ends of the earth to make him successful and in doing so, I was able to take barriers (specifically psychological barriers) out of his way. He turned into one of the toughest associates I have ever had.

One day we were out on appointments and I realized he had the flu, so I told him to go home. He refused. I watched him vomit in the bushes outside of the appointment and then go in and close the deal. This previously fragile being had turned himself into substance harder than a diamond.

Each time you are able to accomplish a turnaround like that, you are making a deposit into someone's emotional bank account. It happens with the small actions and the big ones. Something as simple as sending a text to make sure they are OK if they were out sick goes a long way. The more deposits you make, the better off you will be when you need to make a large withdrawal — because of some type of feedback that you need to give, for example, or a negative performance review. If you have built up your savings when it comes time to have these tough conversations, a lot of the time the person you are leading will be significantly more receptive to the feedback and will address the changes necessary.

Two Things To Keep In Mind

Relationships can spiral down quickly, and like credit card debt, you never want to be overdrawn. I find that the ratio of good deeds to negative ones is typically around 4:1 (so if you make four small positive deposits, you're able to have a small negative withdrawal). This comes from the idea that we as humans tend to process and remember negative feedback more strongly than positive feedback. It is human nature, as the brain handles positive and negative feedback in different areas of the brain. The challenge is making sure that you are sticking to that ratio, and that if you need to make a withdrawal, you have a large enough balance stored.

It takes an incredible amount of dedication to make sure that you have large positive balances with all of the people you are leading. This means that this type of leadership is not something you can fake or adjust to quickly. It is a paradigm shift — at least it was for me — that takes an incredible amount of dedication.",
"When we go into a meeting, we all usually have some sort of plan for what we want to say. But how many of us make a listening plan?

Now, listening may seem like the simplest thing in the world to do, and the idea of taking a few minutes to craft a plan for doing so might seem foolish. But most of us, no matter how well-intentioned we are, are actually terrible listeners. We live in a hyper-paced, multitasking, information-overloaded business world. Even when we think we are listening, we usually only have about 50% of our brain — if that ­— tuned in to the person speaking.

More than likely, you are thinking about what you want to say next, the next meeting, that email you want to write to your boss, the angry client you have to appease, your kid’s doctor appointment, where you put the handout you need for tomorrow’s big presentation, lunch, the budget overrun you need to justify.

The beauty of a listening plan is that it gives your listening intention, structure and purpose. By taking just a few minutes to outline what’s important to hear and what you want to achieve by listening, you’ll have new motivation to pay attention, take notes, and really absorb the information you are receiving.

What goes into a listening plan? First, think about your goal — both your short-term goal (what you want out of this specific meeting) and your long-term goal (what you want in the next meeting, the next quarter, or even over the next year). Then, think about the following:

• What don’t you know that could help you achieve your goals?

• What goals does the other person have?

• What pressures are they facing?

• What do they think about you, your product, your company, or your initiative?

• How does your goal impact their business?

• How big of an ask are you making of them? Remember, what may seem like a small ask to you might actually be a significant ask to them. That’s something you are trying to find out.

Make a determined effort to hear all this information in what they say. Plan out some questions that will help elicit this information. Take notes so that you don’t ask them to repeat something they’ve already told you.

Another benefit of staying focused as part of a listening plan is that it makes it more likely that you’ll pick up on your audience’s non-verbal communication. Pay attention to changes in body language, tone of voice or facial expressions. Most people instinctively react in these non-verbal ways to information that they feel strongly about, either negatively or positively. If you mention pricing and your audience starts taking copious notes, you can infer that cost is important to them. If you talk about building community and the CEO in the room is nodding along, that’s a selling point.

A listening plan can give you an advantage in any situation. If you are going into a meeting as a team, it has the added benefit of making sure that the entire team is aligned on goals and focused on the same key information. You can also divide and conquer: If each person on the team is listening for particular information or is focused on one particular person, you have a better chance of capturing a wider range of information.

With a listening plan, focus and retention skyrocket. Not only will you learn more, but your audience will feel your intention and attention, which will build your credibility and create a strong relationship. It’s a simple step that can pay off dramatically.",
"In the UK and across Europe, we take electricity for granted. At the flick of a switch, push of a button or increasingly when sensors communicate we have light, heating, communication. We rarely even think about, let alone appreciate the luck of being born into a county where energy is so readily available. This, however, is not the reality experienced by all. According to the World Bank, nearly one billion people, mainly in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, do not have access to electricity.

Along with making daily tasks near impossible – such as refrigerating food or working or studying after dark – a lack of energy in the form of electricity fundamentally restricts the development of many countries. Access to electricity reduces poverty, increases opportunity, and improves health, productivity and living standards. It powers devices that make daily living more efficient, freeing-up the populations time to grow the economy in other more creative ways.

Electricity is an essential part of innovation, progress and life. No access represents more than just a loss of potential. It stands against the moral principles that govern our decisions at every level.  And it goes against the basic principles outlined in the Declaration of Human Rights promoting equality and the right to an adequate standard of living to promote health and well-being.

Many areas of the developing world lack access to electricity because they do not have the infrastructure to support it. This involves the physical infrastructure for the generation, transmission and supply of energy, as well as the human skills and expertise needed to maintain and improve the system. Government spending is often overstretched, sadly leaving many citizens quite literally in the dark.

With developing nations struggling, businesses must take an active role in electricity initiatives. There are three core areas of development required: the design and creation of electricity distribution systems, investment in small energy businesses and agencies, and training and education in the electricity sector.

There is a massive opportunity to use renewable technologies, particularly solar to bring electricity to rural communities.  In Kenya for example, the country’s electrification authority is already working with businesses, including Schneider Electric, to implement off-grid solar systems.  Schneider Electric has been involved in a project to power 128 elementary schools. The systems provide electricity to classrooms 24 hours a day. This is a lifeline for some of these communities, given that just over half of Kenya’s population has access to electricity.

In terms of investment, Energy for Africa* is a foundation being set up by the former French minister of State, Jean-Louis Borloo. In collaboration with African heads of state and governments, they are creating a pan-African energy agency that will focus investment specifically on growing access to energy, focusing largely on renewables.  Businesses can get involved and support the foundation and work it is doing.

The regional skills gap is another huge barrier to ubiquitous electricity. In Africa, the AAI (Africa America Institute) report just 2% of university graduates are engineers. In order to grow the talent pool and meet demand, partnerships with educational institutions are vital.

At Schneider Electric, we have committed to training one million people and 10,000 teachers by 2025 as part of our ""Access to Energy"" programme. As part of the programme, we recently partnered with Eastlands College of Technology (ECT) to equip their electricity and solar lab in Nairobi.

The partnership will see the creation of a three-year qualifying Diploma in Electrical and Electronics Engineering and Solar Installations. In addition, ECT will start a micro-entrepreneurship module, raising awareness around entrepreneurship and equipping the trainees with skills to start their own enterprises.

The training strategy is in line with the Government of Kenya’s Big 4 Agenda and Kenya Vision 2030. The College now reaches out to unemployed and untrained youth, middle-level labourers as well as micro-entrepreneurs between 18 and 35 years old in the greater Nairobi area.

There are several other governments and countries where similar schemes are being established or could be established to help bring sustainable energy to communities if businesses step forward to help share technology, knowledge and skills.

Energy for Africa believes that policymakers have an obligation to drive energy access.

If we look at global and national policies, in Africa and Asia in particular, electricity is discussed but has not received backing at the official level. The region needs more than just pledges. They need concrete projects, urgently. Currently, there are a number of initiatives from a number of different funds, but very few are set up with a dedicated target of bringing energy to every region.

This year an agency was unanimously approved by both the African Union, representing governments, and the pan-African parliament, representing citizens. The agency will be headed and run by Africans, for Africans. Businesses can help not only with financing but also with implementing the energy projects that will be funded by the agency.

Energy serves as a leveller for societies. While it gives a huge advantage to those who enjoy it, it provides the potential for everyone to exercise power and improve their lives. This is why energy should be adopted as the next internationally-recognised human right. Fortunately, with the right policy and business solutions in place, we may not be very far from a world where electricity becomes a standard facet of life across the globe, not just in the developed world.

"The three errors under the spotlight are all closely related, and also symptomatic of the same malaise that is all too common in organisations. Although they can manifest at any level of responsibility, inevitably, they can be traced back to the leadership itself. Here they are:

The problem here is the use of the word Drive. It means to compel or urge to move. It implies a lack of willingness on the part of whatever is being driven to move of its own accord - an inertia or stasis.

As soon as you associate the word drive with anything, you label what is being driven as incapable of having either the physical or mental resources to drive itself. Cars, of course have the power to move but not the intelligence to harness that power safely and efficiently (yet) - so they need driving. Slaves could not be trusted to do what was in the interests of their owners (no surprise there) so a slave-driver was used to improve their performance.

The word drive suggests a resource that is naturally static, incapable of self-determination and fundamentally untrustworthy. Something that will behave in a chaotic, unpredictable and damaging way if left to its own devices.

So having exposed the associations behind the verb to drive, let's consider its use in a leadership context:

Firstly, applying it to abstractions such as performance and profit makes no sense whatsoever. Both of these are outcomes of activity and can only be influenced indirectly, never directly.

Trying to drive profit (presumably upwards) is like adjusting the TV to change the plot of a film.

But even more crass is its use with people. Driving employees and staff is to reduce them to little more than drones - incapable of autonomy, responsibility... perhaps even humanity.

The upshot of a driven culture can only be the reverse of what is intended, as the driving power becomes evermore centralised and limited.

Maybe Miller in Repo Man was right when he said, ""The more you drive, the less intelligent you are.""

This syndrome is both insidious and endemic. Leaders devolve activities but maintain a level of interest that quickly becomes interference when anything unexpected or undesirable occurs.

Micromanagement is a good example in which the delegate is reduced to a minion - a servile lackey - with no discretion, no independence - no responsibility.

The behaviour - on the part of the leader - is fear-based. They have little faith in the ability of their employee to complete the task successfully. Yet they do not have the time, or perhaps the skills, to do it themselves. So they devolve activity and retain responsibility. This is not leadership.

Delegation means to send away as a representative. Distance is implicit. So is autonomy.

he was referring to the upside of delegation which is empowering, productive and creates more leaders, not fewer.

3. Using ""I"" Not ""We""

Using the first person in a leadership capacity can often betray identification with the power and profile of the position, instead of the responsibilities and service that it entails.

Some leaders hang on to their I status, creating a facade of omnipotence. Regrettably they also deny the collective power and creativity of the organisation and attempt to appropriate it for themselves.

In doing so they will inevitably commit errors 1. and 2. and eventually surround themselves with those that are incapable of initiative, creating an unscalable organisation.

These leaders commit the cardinal sin of letting their egos usurp the power of their teams, throttling human potential in the process.",
"In the last week, we have learned that Uber, Lyft, and Slack plan 2019 IPOs. I am sure that a few more highly valued private companies are also  planning to go public in 2019.

It is something that I have been expecting and predicting for a few years now. Eventually these companies that have raised a ton of capital in the private markets will choose to go public and generate liquidity for the shareholders who plowed all of that capital into them.

And yet storm clouds are on the horizon for the capital markets in 2019. Rates have risen significantly in the last 18 months, pulling capital out of the equity markets and into the fixed income markets. There are some leading indicators that suggest a business slowdown is on the horizon, which would be the first one in the U.S. in a decade. And, of course, the situation in D.C. is getting dicey and that will weigh on markets as well.

Good companies can go public in bad markets so I am not saying that the long delayed IPO plans of juggernauts like Uber will be squashed by a bear market in 2019.

But what I am saying is that 2019 is shaping up to be a very interesting year for the capital markets that power the startup economy.

There is a big difference between the private markets and the public markets. They do not move in lockstep. For years now, the late-stage private markets have been trading at valuations that are well in excess of their public market comps. That is true for a number of reasons. First, private market investors have longer time horizons and are looking for a three to five year return, not an immediate one. Second, private market investors get a liquidation preference which in theory protects them from losses. Finally, deals in the private markets clear in an auction like environment where the highest bidder wins the deal. All of these factors mean that a hot company can raise capital in the private markets at valuations well in excess of where they can raise capital (and trade) in the public markets.

But the public and private markets are connected to each other. If the Nasdaq falls significantly, and it is down roughly 15 percent from its highs in the late summer/early fall, then it will eventually weigh on the private markets.

And, if Uber, Lyft, and Slack do go public in 2019, where they price and where they trade will impact startup valuations, both late-stage and ultimately early-stage too.

These markets--public, late-stage private, and early-stage private--feed off each other and the participants in one look to the others for supply of deals and liquidity. So while they may appear to be disconnected, and often are, they do ultimately sync up.

And so I'm wondering if 2019 is the year they start to sync up again, after quite some time being out of sync. And if that comes to pass, what it means for our portfolio companies and their financing and liquidity options.

Fortunately for most of our portfolio companies, and most companies in the startup sector, we have had a number of years of very flush capital markets and many companies have strong balance sheets and a lot of staying power. The same is true of most venture capital firms as the past few years have been a great time to raise capital.

So if things slow down in 2019--and I am not predicting they will, but I think they might--the startup sector is in good shape to weather it. But at some level, the startup capital markets are a game of musical chairs and you don't want to be the one who can't find the chair when the music stops.",
"On December 18, 2017, Bitcoin hit an all-time high price of $19,498.63. Just a year later, it's trading at $3,683, the same price from September of 2017 from where it started its meteoric run. Part of this has had to do with ICOs and the ""buzz"" around blockchain.

But that's changing, and fast. Recently, both DJ Khaled and Floyd Mayweather were hit with fraud charges for promoting ICOs without disclosing that these were paid endorsements -- similar to the charges Elon Musk faced for his not-so-harmless 420 tweet manipulating the stock price of Tesla.

Additionally, other projects touting Blockchain have been caught out as fraudulent, such as the Bitcointopia land development project in Elko, Nevada. While expressing a desire to use Bitcoin for land payments and the blockchain for everything from title registration to mesh communication networks, all it allegedly did was act as a vehicle to steal people's money.

And the charges are eerily similar to those against Arisebank. Jared Rice, CEO of AriseBank promising a decentralized banking platform built on the blockchain, raised $4 million in an ICO -- where he issued unregistered securities. He allegedly misled investors on how much they'd raised, he claimed $600 million, and misused company funds for personal hotels, clothing, food and more.

According to ICOrating.com, out of 800 ICOs completed in 2017, only half raised more than $100,000. In 2018, less than 50 percent of ICOs hit their funding target, and by the end of the year, 76.15 percent of ICO projects had nothing but an idea behind them.

According to MERL, out of 43 advertised blockchain projects they investigated, not a single one has created any financial returns for investors, released a product, or even published peer-reviewed research papers to prove that their blockchain solution is even feasible.

It's enough to make even the least skeptical among us start to wonder if there is something fishy in the crypto waters.

Blockchain is a nascent technology, a framework that is looking for a solution. It is currently in what I call the ""throw spaghetti at the wall"" phase of development. This is the ""wild, wild west"", where anything goes. Like it's spiritual buzzworthy cousin, AI, there's a lot of promise, and not many results, yet.

But, like Monsanto Director of Digital Partnerships Anju Gupta says of their AI projects, a 99 percent failure in projects is acceptable because ""that 1 percent is going to bring exponential gain.""

The market is getting smarter.

Remember those stats I quoted above -- that there are more ICOs than ever who are trying to get funded with just an idea, and that more ICOs aren't reaching funding goals? The flip side of that is that 15 percent of funded projects already had a working business, versus 6 percent the previous year.

It's not that people aren't investing, it's that people are paying more attention to what they're investing in. As an example, one of the largest ICOs of 2018 was in Telegram, a popular decentralized messaging platform alternative to WhatsApp and Skype.

The big players are coming out.

This allows large corporations and governments to come in and think seriously about how blockchain fits into their business model. As an example, South Korea is developing a blockchain voting system, and the UAE has plans to transfer 51 percent of their government paperwork processes to blockchain systems by 2021.

Cryptocurrency is becoming increasingly more regulated.

When there's money involved, there's inevitably going to be fraud -- and that's why regulations are being passed to protect people against it. While we're still in the early phases, the risk is higher for many.",
"As AI capabilities are assigned to a growing number of marketing projects, questions of “where do we go from here” are increasingly common… and challenging to answer. The boundaries of AI for marketers remain unclear, and it’s far from resolved how AI and human skills intersect.

I recently asked Inhi Cho Suh, general manager, Watson customer engagement at IBM, a few questions about AI and marketing.

Paul Talbot: When marketers think about AI, there’s often a line drawn between creative and everything else. There’s a school of thought that suggests AI is fine for media planning and investment, but inappropriate for creative development. Where does IBM weigh in on this?

Inhi Cho Suh: It's right to see AI-powered marketing as a solution to automate tasks like media planning and surfacing insights from massive amounts of data. There's more opportunity than just automation for AI. We're at the start of applying AI in the creative aspects of marketing as well.

For example, a content management system that understands what content - whether its image, video, music, speech, it stores; AI can scan through every image, video clip, or email template and automatically apply tags to those assets, saving a marketer a lot of time.

AI can actually play an integral role in helping marketers make decisions about creative and copy development. Take for example IBM Watson Ads. It allows brands to have personalized conversations with consumers at scale and provides insights from campaigns helping illuminate what products, services or particular variants drove the highest engagement among consumers.

These learnings can then be incorporated into future campaigns so that creative can be personalized by geography or demographic.

Talbot: Skilled creative teams have traditionally been students of research, research not just about the product and the competition but the prospect or the customer. Are there ways AI can help creative teams do this work differently, and perhaps more effectively?

Suh: One of the biggest areas where AI can support creative research is detecting anomalies or struggle in the customer experience. Is the content you are creating performing well above your historical benchmarks? What are the predicted implications of adding similar content at different points in the customer journey.

Detecting these trends as they play out in real-time helps marketers double down on what's working, and quickly adjust what's not.

Talbot: The development of what David Ogilvy referred to as “The Big Idea”… can AI help?

Suh: Today's marketers understand that big ideas in marketing and advertising don't just happen in a boardroom anymore. They are built through in-depth research, predictive analysis, and rigorous testing. AI can support all of these initiatives to make sure the big ideas really are as big as we think.

At the most fundamental level, AI has the potential to enable professionals to free up time that would otherwise be spent on tedium (manual data entry, pivot tables, insertion orders, sifting through countless hours of content) and instead empower us to focus on higher value tasks, like contemplating ""the big idea.""

Talbot: For the creative director who wants to be ahead of the curve on the role AI can play, what are right questions to ask, what’s the most illuminating information to gather, and how should the process of weaving AI into the creative team’s work be approached?

Suh: The best areas to consider AI in the creative workflow is at the beginning and at the end. In the beginning – what areas should we be focusing on? How should we be speaking to our customers? What will resonate the most?

At the end – how is my content actually resonating? Is it meeting or exceeding our expectations? Do we need to iterate on this design based on performance? AI and ML can support the creative process by giving the team the ability to create full steam ahead, knowing they are headed in the right direction.

Talbot: Any other thoughts on the role of AI in the development of marketing content?

Suh: I think there is a misconception around using AI in the creative space.

AI is simply a tool in the creative team's toolbox. It is the next evolution of humans using technology to help them do their work. Creative teams have been using technology for years whether it's the computers they work on every day, the software they design in, or the execution channels where their work is shared. AI is another instrument in the creative team's arsenal, and we can't wait to see what they do with it.",
"As more women are taking steps to advance their careers, some men may be thwarting their efforts. According to a study conducted by LeanIn.Org and SurveyMonkey, almost half of male managers are uncomfortable engaging with women in work activities, such as mentoring or socializing together.

The #MeToo era has made some men fearful of interacting with women, worried that what they might say or do could be misinterpreted as inappropriate or sexual harassment. Ironically, the men worried about being misinterpreted are probably not the ones who have intentions to abuse their power in the first place. Nevertheless, men are retreating, and decreased interaction with women can be detrimental to women's careers.

Women should not be focused on or have the responsibility to change men’s behavior. It is not a woman’s job to make a man feel comfortable. But until men learn how to cope and support women in their advancement, women can still take steps of their own. Here are six tips to help you continue moving in a forward direction and not let others’ behavior curtail your career:

1. Initiate, and invite a few good men and women to dinner.

Some men are foregoing having dinner or lunch with female colleagues out of fear that meeting over a meal could be misinterpreted as inappropriate or a date. The Lean.Org and SurveyMonkey study found that senior men are almost four times more likely to hesitate to have a work dinner with a junior-level woman than their male counterpart.

If men are not going to invite you, start inviting them. Bring along a couple of other colleagues so it is a party of many. If you need to have a one-on-one conversation over a meal, consider a restaurant or establishment known at work and around town to be the spot for working business lunches or dinners. Or grab a cup of coffee with your male colleague, and sit in the cafeteria. Identify people and places that make it clear that it is a work meeting.

Senior men are five times more likely to hesitate to travel for work with a junior-level woman, according to the study. Some men say they do not want to sit next to their female colleagues on planes. Who wants to sit next to your boss or colleague in an enclosed space for that long anyway?

Just because you may be both attending the same out of town meeting does not mean you have to sit next to them on the plane or be on the same hotel floor. You are not family. You are not in grade school. Make your own travel reservations.

Some men note that they feel uncomfortable meeting with women behind closed doors. When you need to schedule a meeting with a man who seems uncomfortable engaging with women, schedule your meeting in a conference room with windows. A neutral, open room can ease fears of being the only two in the room.

To be clear, women should not have to accommodate men. But if it is something small like a change in office location, this may be a quick and easy way to help you achieve your goals. Minor adjustments can benefit you.

Some men are uncomfortable mentoring women, particularly younger women, for fear of the professional relationship being misinterpreted by the mentee and/or third parties as unprofessional in nature. Most mentoring relationships develop naturally and lack structure, which can make parties unclear about the nature of the relationship.

One way to make the mentoring relationship clearer to the parties is to establish a formal mentorship program with well-defined roles and goals. The structure and formality of the work program can help the relationship to clearly be seen as professional in nature.

If you need mentorship by a male leader in your organization who seems uncomfortable engaging with women, push for a formal mentorship program at your company as a way to facilitate the relationship you need to advance your career.

5. Ask the man, “Is there an issue?”

If you sense an issue, raise it. Ask your male colleague (in a non brow-raising way), “Is there an issue?” Consider then saying, “I’d like to talk about it so we both feel comfortable moving forward.” Nothing will be done until people start talking about the issues and having honest conversations that can lead to constructive solutions.

Your colleague may feel uncomfortable sharing with you the issue and not initially share how he is really feeling. But asking whether there is an issue shows him that you want to understand what he is feeling. Maybe the next time he might feel more inclined to be honest and start a discussion.

If nothing else works, leave. There is only so much you can (and should) do. Not every organization or place is the same. Know when to move on to advance your career.

Your career, and the advancement of it, is ultimately your responsibility. If some men are unable to help, don’t wait for them to figure it out on their own. Find ways to help yourself.

"Last time out, I looked at six commercial missteps that can affect deal momentum. But you as a business owner – both in terms of your attitude and decision-making – likely have the most important role in the way a transaction plays out.

Most business owners are highly motivated, and constantly push through obstacles. They have identified a goal and are committed to achieving it. Owners who successfully navigate the company sale process are generally ready for a hard-fought battle and self-aware about what they want to achieve for themselves and their families.

What you might be unprepared for is when a buyer pores over your business forensically, and ruthlessly assesses your own role in the company too. If you’re not psychologically ready to be analyzed, questioned and criticized, you may find it difficult to cope.

I discussed how to mentally prepare and develop resilience on a recent webinar.

When you’re negotiating with a buyer, it is critical to understand which party has leverage in the negotiation, and equally important to know exactly what you want to achieve.

From the very first communication with potential buyers, you must understand that every spoken word and every written document is broadly speaking “part of the negotiation.”  You should understand what to say (and what not to say) before ever setting foot in a conference room with interested parties. Also, before handing over any document, ask yourself – is this correct? What impact will it have when reviewed later, and how will it help or hurt us in the negotiations?  Your advisor should be looking down playing field and communicate issues ahead of time in order to position you properly for the upcoming discussions.

Small-talk and more direct conversations between principals often occur during the transaction process to further personal chemistry and business understandings, or to begin to think about high level post-closing integration issues.  How will we work together?

Nevertheless, a common buyer tactic in M&A is to isolate you from your advisory team and attempt to outmaneuver you. It’s tempting to talk to your buyer face-to-face, but there are clear risks. Do not be the over-confident, over-accommodating CEO who drifts into sidebar negotiations.

That kind of seller responds to seemingly innocuous emails directly without filtering them through the advisory team. That seller takes late-night personal phone calls from his buyer, who then casually suggests a private dinner to work through the remaining thorny issues. While at dinner, the buyer may suggest that the principals can handle matters directly – and let the advisors just sit it out on the sidelines. (“All of these expensive professionals are just getting in the way, aren’t they?”) You’re feeling comfortable with this guy, and you respond to this personal approach…

We know that trouble is lurking when understandings from casual discussions re-enter formal negotiations. Bear in mind that the buyer usually has more M&A experience than you, and sidebar agreements typically weaken your hand.

Our client Gary had unique knowledge about the minutest nuances of the operational and value chain economics of his company and industry.  He literally was “the man” – a recognized worldwide expert.  A lot of the due diligence resided inside his head including a voluminous amount of regulatory facts and interpretations. As a practical matter, we knew direct discussions had to happen and would be accretive to the overall deal.  We had urged caution and insisted that all phone calls be scheduled and managed with clear agendas and our participation. The CEO of the acquiring company was a veteran and battle-hardened M&A practitioner.  With the swagger of a rebellious kid jaywalking across a busy intersection, he kept trying to exclude us from negotiations, and isolate Gary into a corner, when he felt certain points were not going his way.  “For goodness sake,” we entreated Gary, “you have to stop accepting his calls at all hours of the day and night.”

Gary felt entirely exposed and worn down.  While his counterpart was not the seasoned expert Gary was in Gary’s business, he was his superior in negotiating an M&A deal.  The whole thing wound up causing extreme stress on everyone.  As just an example of the daily onslaught, one day the buyer informed us that our client had agreed to cut purchase price because of an IT-related issue identified in due diligence - a fait accompli.  When we told Gary the problems and costs were overstated, he grimaced.  “What have I done?”  Our response to the other side, “nice one, but those issues can be resolved with minimum charge after the deal.  No discount, no change and stop these antics, which are now causing the deal to teeter.”  Fortunately, our side was eventually able to regain command and control, and navigate the perilous deal dynamics to a favorable outcome for Gary and his company.

Of course you want a big payout from the sale of your company. Healthy aspirations are warranted, and should even be encouraged. But you need to be realistic, too. Separate from your discussions with your advisor, you should reflect whether the value you desire is in sync with the messages you’re getting from buyers who have reviewed your business. Those messages can be overt or unspoken. Sellers who fixate on their “magic number,” and hydroplane over market signals and feedback about their business, ignoring all the available evidence, can seriously diminish the prospect of completing their deal.

If you have minority shareholders, they are generally going to be along for the ride. But they may also have important rights that need to be taken into consideration. Their priorities ought to be considered, particularly if they are active in management.

For instance, how do we balance the desire of an older partner who wants to diversify his holdings with an eye to retirement, versus the younger partners who need a continuing source of income to support young and growing families?  Or, when three siblings own a business in which only the children of one of the original founders are employed? How important will concern for those children’s future employment manifest in the transaction negotiations?

It is vital that open lines of communication are maintained throughout the negotiations. To the extent that stakeholder objectives are not fully aligned, the rights and responsibilities of all parties need to be balanced.

Shocks to the economy and other factors beyond our control can undermine a transaction. What do we do after a market correction that may indicate bad times are on the way?  How should we respond to changes in industry policies and regulations such as changes to national healthcare or renewable energy?

A contingency plan should be in place for the business to respond to such changes. You should continue to run your business during the M&A process as if you were never going to sell it, both because you want to deliver a strong going entity to buyers when you do sell, and in case strong economic headwinds delay your transaction.

When a client tells us that they have a neighbor who is a lawyer and can work on their deal, we know there is a good chance the transaction will not go according to plans. When it took that neighbor two weeks to go through a definitive agreement scheduled for a three-day turn, one client told us: “He’s my attorney, right? He’s protecting my interests.” Right, he is probably terrific at his specialty. But he has no idea what is reasonable and not reasonable, or risky and not risky in a company sale transaction.

I personally know a lawyer in Chicago who has made a career of being the counsel in the shadows helping unqualified attorneys who have been engaged by friends or long-standing clients to run M&A transactions. Get an attorney you trust, of course. But also choose one who knows the demands of a deal inside-out.

For each of these deal killers, there are warning flags and solutions. An experienced advisor can recognize potential problems and mitigate them before they can harm the transaction.  Great advisors can deliver a superior result and make sure you get the deal you deserve, whereas inferior or inexperienced advisors will do the opposite. Be confident in your choice. Research their track record and their reach. You’re going to be partners on a challenging journey, so you need a personal connection too. But, like your choice of lawyer, go for someone who understands the landscape.

As with many things in life, praemonitus praemunitus – forewarned is forearmed.  There are many pitfalls that can undermine the successful sale of your business. Advance planning, coordination, a smart choice of advisors, and thorough preparation can help you avoid all of them.",
"After an eclectic career, including over a decade sharing an office with Ben and Jerry (yes, that Ben and Jerry, of Cherry Garcia fame), Duane Peterson is deeply committed to the for-benefit model of business. He acts on this commitment as Co-President and Founder of SunCommon, bringing affordable and sustainable clean energy to customers in Vermont and the Hudson Valley. But for-benefit companies like SunCommon don’t stop with what they’re selling, they also deeply consider the benefit they’re having on their employees. Peterson shared with me his efforts to establish a loving and caring place to work.

After watching Unilever acquire Ben & Jerry’s, Peterson knew he’d set up his next company as a Public Benefit Corporation. The incorporation documents of a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC) create an obligation not only to create value for shareholders, but also to create some benefit to the general public. PBCs are also obliged to be transparent about and accountable for that value on an annual basis. It’s important to note that there isn’t yet any auditing body to track that reporting.

But SunCommon is also a B Corp, a certification created and managed by B Lab, a not-for-profit organization. SunCommon and the other 2,500+ certified B Corps around the world are audited every two to three years by B Lab to ensure they’re upholding the standards of doing business as a force for good.  If you want to dig deep into these new tools for integrating profit and purpose in the very fabric of a business, this recent report by Yale is a great resource.

For those of you looking for ways to build more impact into your own job, or perhaps for your team or entire company, here are the top ways that Peterson is building SunCommon as a for-benefit workplace.

Perhaps the most potent example of the joy at SunCommon was Peterson’s description of the first combined all-hands event, with the full Hudson Solar team after merging with SunCommon. A group of SunCommon employees was holding each Hudson Solar employee’s name with balloons when they got off the bus in Vermont, having driven up from their Hudson Valley workplace.  Not your typical merger indeed – watch the joy in action!

Peterson and his co-founder, James Moore, started SunCommon to address the climate crisis, and they are doing that with rapid growth in Vermont and now the Hudson Valley. Lots of us are living with anxiety around the urgency of problems facing our planet and society. The ‘why’ of integrating impact into our work is a foregone conclusion at this point. And changing it often requires significant adjustments to your job or business model.

But we answer the question of ‘how’ we do our work every day. And anyone can create benefit in the world by doing their work with more love. Peterson and the SunCommon team have some inspiring answers to ‘how’ to build for-benefit businesses. They’re conscious of the need to diversify the demographics of their company, improve internal communications to better engage all employees in the mission, and make more money so they have some to give away. Those goals sound pretty do-able, in light of Peterson’s joy and love for his work and colleagues, as well as SunCommon’s baked-in commitments to benefitting their employees, as well as communities and our planet.

How can you answer the question of ‘how’ you create benefit at your job?  Don’t take Peterson’s word for it being a fantastic way to show up to work. Linking your work to purpose in this way has been proven to reduce heart disease, dementia, and anxiety, and increase productivity and life expectancy.",None
"If chief enablers, enrollers or experience officers are generally the good cops, chief enforcers are most definitely the bad cops. These are the CEOs at the top of the hierarchy oozing command and control from every pore. But this is exactly what’s required to lead a production-focused organization.

The overall thesis of this series of four articles is that the only four ways to succeed as a CEO are to act as chief enabler, enforcer, enroller or customer experience officer. This is the final choice flowing from your overall strategic choice, which dictates your choice of culture, organization, how to operate, and the CEO’s role.

The framework for What It Takes To Accelerate Through A Strategic Inflection Point is laid out in that earlier article. The main point is that you must align your culture, organization, operations and CEO’s real job around one of four strategies. The overall framework for CEOs’ focus is laid out in my article on Why Most CEOs Are Not Strategic Personally. This current article will dig into what it means to be the chief enforcer.

Best-in-class producing/manufacturing organizations have cultures of stability/discipline, results and authority (and independence), hierarchies of scientific leaders operating with command and control ways of working, led by chief enforcement officers leveraging strong, clear policies.

Being best in class in production producing things more effectively and efficiently than anyone else. This requires extraordinary discipline and consistency, constantly refining and refocusing your processes and procedures.

Best in class producers thrive on stability. They focus on results and appreciate the clarity that comes with clear authority. Tell them what to do and they’ll get it done.

Classic hierarchies work best for production-focused organizations. The chain of command works with people that appreciate being told what to do. They want to know whose direction to follow.

This is where command and control works. Yes it’s old school. Yes it blunts some innovation. But for people that appreciate being told what to do, working with command and control is a good thing.

In a production-focused, stable, hierarchical organization operating with a heavy dose of command and control, the “E” in CEO should stand for Enforcer. If everyone is looking up, they are ultimately looking up at the CEO. Any wobble there can destabilize everyone in the hierarchy below the CEO – which is everyone.

These CEOs lead with policies mandating definite courses or methods of action that all must follow. For production-focused organizations policies inspire and enable. Producers find clarity inspiring. Tight swim lanes enable them to do their job.

Producers love enforcers. Others in the organization won’t be so sure. Those that value independence will see the CEO as too controlling. Those that value flexibility will see the CEO as too rigid.

For design and customer service focused organizations, strict enforcement of policies and a command and control way of operating is exactly wrong. It is way too controlling and rigid for them. But for a production-focused organization, it’s what’s needed.

If you’re leading producers, be unapologetic about your policies and controls. Those that choose not to follow those policies and live with those controls should choose to work elsewhere. Or you should make that choice for them. The #1 regret experienced leaders have looking back on their careers is not moving fast enough on people. In a hierarchy, people will look to the leader for examples of leadership. In these cases some early public hangings can send exactly the right signals to those looking for stability and clarity.",
"There was a time when watching a David Attenborough wildlife documentary was an unalloyed pleasure. Today it’s a little different. The stunning images continue to delight, but the context has changed. Climate change, population growth and pollution are all taking their toll on wildlife. And when the focus is on the world's oceans, it’s hard not to be depressed at the sheer volume of plastic that is finding its way , not only into the water, but on to the marine food chain.

Much of the plastic that ends up in rivers, oceans and landfill sites can be recycled but to some extent that requires a will on the part of consumers around the globe. So the question is - how do you encourage ordinary people to take their plastic to collection centers, or put it into dedicated recycling bins, rather than simply throwing it away without thought?

On the face of it, this is a policy issue. For example, governments can discourage the use of plastic products, such as carrier bags, by imposing taxes. But what about the positive side of the equation. How do you actively incentivize citizens to do their bit for the planet?

Enter Norwegian startup, Empower. By using a blockchain-enabled system, the company believes it can successfully nudge consumers - and particularly those in emerging markets - towards taking the kind of action that will significantly reduce plastic pollution.

In Search Of A Use Case

Empower founder Wilhelm Myrer acknowledges that the development of a blockchain-based solution to the plastics issue marked a step change in his entrepreneurial progress. Previously, he had been working on alternatives to traditional bank accounts but had not succeeded in convincing backers or users. “We didn’t really come up with a use case,” he say.

But following a chance meeting, he was asked by Nordic Ocean Watch  if there was any way that blockchain technology could be deployed in service of the organisation’s mission to clean up beaches. Myrer sent founder Simen Knudsen a presentation and after subsequent conversations, the idea for Empower was born.

Myrer’s plan was deceptively simple. Around the world there are a range of organisations - NGOs, corporate businesses and even governments - that are prepared to pay for projects to reduce waste. What they require is a way to bring consumers - those who might otherwise simply discard products - on board with their recycling initiatives.

Myrer’s answer was to use blockchain solution as a means both to record the waste brought to collection centers and to reward those who gather it. “The blockchain provides our partners with information on how much has been brought in and when, and also rewards those who bring the plastic by issuing tokens,” he says, adding that participants receive the equivalent of $1 for every kilo of waste. And in addition, the information captured by the ledger systems can be fed into supply chains, if and when the waste is sold on.

As Myrer sees it, the system can be used in the industrialized world, but it has a particular application in emerging markets, where he says the tokenized rewards can be a catalyst in terms of getting people involved. He cites the example of a trial in Laos. “We ran a pilot. When word got round, everyone from the town came with their plastic,  and then from the other towns in the area. We had to close it down because we didn’t have the capacity.”

And that is, arguably, the biggest challenge. If Empower and its partners are to make a real impact, then it has to be done to scale.  As Myrer sees it, the way forward is to establish partnerships that will provide the facilities to process large quantities of plastic.

This year, we have collected about 10 tons of waste,” says Myrer. “Next year, we are targeting 10,000 tons. So the challenge is to get the partners we need.” Ultimately the goal is to claw in 1 million tons a year.

But is this a business, or simply a good deed in a wicked world? “We are established as a for profit business,” says Myrer. “We have revenue streams. We charge 15% commission on the waste collected and we are also developing digital solutions for retail companies.”

To date, the company has been funded by bootstrapping, augmented by a 50,000 euro “impact maker”  award received at the sustainability-focused Xynteo Exchange summit in Oslo last month. But with just six people on the payroll, it is seeking further funding to scale up.

Rewards-driven recycling is not in itself a new idea. In Norway, 97% of plastic bottles are recycled through collection points that return a tax charge that is initially levied on each unit. But Myrer believes that his system is capable of being rolled out - via NGOs and corporations - to otherwise hard-to-reach consumers in emerging markets.

If it works, it may provide another example of how blockchain has the potential  to change the world in surprisingly non financial ways.",
"No successful businessperson got to where they are today without a little help. Most of us know we can’t accomplish everything on our own, yet many professionals are shy about asking for help in the workplace for fear of inconveniencing others.

Your questions and concerns are as important as those of the people you work with, and asking a trusted colleague for help when you need it is sensible and smart. It might feel uncomfortable, but sometimes it’s necessary not only to do your job right, but also for personal and professional growth. Forbes Coaches Council members offer ways to put your fear aside and start seeking assistance when you need it.

1. Prepare Yourself To Ask The Right Questions

First of all, you need to stop thinking that it will inconvenience others. Asking for someone’s help is a sign of respect. Here are a few things that will help you: First, did you try to figure out the answer before you asked for help? Next, think about the problem. Third, make a list of questions to ask. In the end, your preparation will make it more comfortable for you to ask for help. - Amy Modglin, Modglin Leadership Solutions

2. Study How Your Colleagues Ask For Help

Your fears may not be unfounded, as you might notice that asking for help where you work could be perceived as a sign of weakness. If that’s the case, then find the ways others ask for and accept help at work. Watch and even ask someone who could help you this critical, simple but important question: “What might be the best way to ask you for help on this project?” Let people tell you how to do it. - John M. O’Connor, Career Pro Inc.

When we don’t see the inherent value in ourselves it’s important to “act as if.” This means to act as if you are somebody who is confident and successful and deserves assistance. Find someone you admire and opt to think based on “What would they do?” When you take action in this light, it has been found that others will respond to you differently, and you will own it over time. - Laura DeCarlo, Career Directors International

4. Think Of It As Acting On Behalf Of The Business

Many people avoid asking for help because they think it inconveniences others or shows that you are incapable of doing your job. It is important to shift this way of thinking. Think of the result if you don’t get the help. Will it have a negative impact on the team, project or business? This will help you clarify your priorities. When you ask for help on behalf of the business, you are being solution-focused. - Erin Hoffman, Collaboration Business Consulting

5. Don’t Wait Until Something Goes Wrong

Rest assured that even if someone does feel inconvenienced (and they probably won’t), they would rather be inconvenienced early on, before chaos ensues. Keep in mind that getting help will benefit everyone rather than waiting until things go wrong unnecessarily. Also, build relationships so you don’t feel like you only engage with them when you need help. It’s all for the greater good! - Tonya Echols, Thrive Coaching Solutions

6. Give Others The Opportunity To Contribute

People love to contribute. We get fulfilled as human beings when we help others. Yet when someone doesn’t ask, for fear of inconveniencing others, they rip us off of the opportunity to contribute. It is like they are withholding a precious gift. The other thing to remember is that people are not obligated and you can trust them to make their own decisions. When you realize that, ask away. - Janet Zaretsky, Empowered Women Enterprisess, LLC dba Janet Zaretsky

7. Research The Issue Before You Ask For Help

Everyone needs help in life, no matter who you are. The important thing is knowing who to go to for help and doing your due diligence in researching the issue first. After that is completed, approach the expert and let them know what you have found during your research and then your problem. This will show them that you are in real need of their expertise. - Michelle Weathersby, LENS Consulting Firm

Though such hesitations are common, it is mostly unfounded. Asking for help has many benefits, including showing confidence, that you’re a team player, and that you have an ability to be productive and efficient, as well as creating a deeper personal relationship with other team members. Turn the fear into the belief that you are actually showing emotional maturity. - Kamyar Shah, World Consulting Group

Your top priority at work should be to effectively complete the task at hand. When your focus is on the end result, you won’t shirk in asking for help. Besides, seeking help from your co-workers will open doors for them to approach you when they need help from you. This will improve interpersonal relationships and promote a congenial working environment. A friendly team is always an impetus. - Anjali Chugh, Cosmique Global Inc.

10. Consider The Possible Outcome Of Not Asking

To move past this fear, consider the alternative — if you don’t ask for help and somehow mess up, wouldn’t that be an even worse outcome and possibly inconvenience others even more? Asking for help demonstrates self-awareness and an orientation towards learning, and it helps build trust with your colleagues. Through your courage, you also make it easier for others to ask for help. - Dina Denham Smith, Cognitas Coaching & Consulting

Help create an environment of collaboration by first becoming a relentless giver. By helping others maintain their focus on creating the best possible solution to the challenge in front of them, and then by helping crowdsource that solution, you put yourself in an informal leadership position: Your colleagues will know you’re there to help. Next time you need help, they’ll be ready to give back. - Mark S. Babbitt, YouTern and WorqIQ

12. Practice Asking For And Receiving Help

Start by asking people you are comfortable with for help, perhaps a family member or a coworker you already trust. Then, practice receiving a compliment or help graciously by saying thank you without putting yourself down. Once you feel at ease, test your skills with someone a bit less familiar. Remember, human beings are hard-wired to connect and innately want to help each other. - Kris McCrea Scrutchfield, McCrea Coaching

13. Don’t Try To Be A Hero

Self-assured leaders are prepared to admit they don’t have the answers and are willing to ask for help. Doing so empowers others to step into a role of personal accountability and shine. Acknowledging your fear but moving forward in spite of it takes a leader who knows when to ask for help, learns how to accept it with grace and is willing to offer help in return. Be an ally, not a hero. - Tracey Grove, Pure Symmetry Coaching and Consulting",
"In my previous post (see ""Career Mobility? Up Is Not The Only Way"") I interviewed Dr. Beverly Kaye, recognized internationally as one of the most knowledgeable and practical experts on career development and employee engagement. We talked about the idea of “ownershift” as it relates to career mobility, and explored the various ways smart people can navigate the modern workplace.

In this follow-up conversation, Dr. Kaye offers additional insights into the challenges and opportunities facing today’s workers.

Rodger Dean Duncan: In what ways can a career be rejuvenated by voluntarily taking a step back or down?

Beverly Kaye: This is certainly a less positively perceived direction to raise with individuals, managers and the organization. For many people there’s an unconscious bias about selecting this particular move as a next step in a career. (It’s the old “what will others think?” concern that gets in the way.)

Taking a step back or down can be a viable choice, and many who select it and grow from it eventually look back at this as one of the most important turning points (for the better) in their career.

An example I’ve seen repeatedly is the competent technical specialist who accepts a managerial promotion and then realizes he/she misses that technical work and is simply not comfortable (nor very effective) in the role of leading others. Admitting this to oneself is half the battle—talking about and calling attention to the misalignment is not easy. Handling the pejorative misperceptions of coworkers adds to the reticence. Imagine the number of talented people who suffer in silence because this admission is so difficult.

I’ve seen many excellent employees leave organizations for other companies in technical specialist positions because they are so uncomfortable in the management role.

My husband, a “rocket scientist” and PhD from MIT, was in this very position. He was able to raise the issue with his own manager (with some coaxing from his wife) and return to the technical work that he loved and remained in for 31 years.

We struggled to name this option and settled on “Step Back for a Reason or a Season.” We met a number of people who decided to take a lower position in their organization in order to move to a more growth-oriented area. These are legitimate career moves and people who select this mobility option need to be recognized and congratulated. Alas, this is not an easy choice.

Duncan: What can, or should, organizations do to encourage employees to take a more creative (or at least a less traditional) view toward managing their own careers?

Kaye: The benefit in terms of engagement and retention should be enough to motivate any organization and its leaders to make some small but significant changes in the way career information is disseminated and supported.

Some basic ideas for organizations that want to support their employees in thinking more creatively about their own development include:

Duncan: What are some of the telltale signs that a person should consider an employment change—either a different kind of job, or a new employer, or both?

Kaye: The signs are plentiful. The challenge is to recognize them in yourself as well as in those that report to you, and to engage in the conversation that is begging to be held. Telltale signs include:

In the Love ‘Em or Lose 'Em book we organized our findings around the alphabet, naming 26 areas that caused employees to stay or leave the company. The “J” chapter was for “Jerk,” and we identified 50 behaviors that employees reported as their reasons for leaving their organizations. In the keynotes and workshops that I and my team delivered, this chapter stimulated the most discussions. We usually had no problem getting managers to admit some of their own “jerk” behaviors.

Duncan: Hearkening back to one of your earlier books (Love It, Don’t Leave It), what are the two or three most important things people can do to become more engaged in and derive more satisfaction from their current jobs?

Kaye: When managers in our Love ‘Em or Lose ‘Em seminars asked, “Is it all on our shoulders? Shouldn’t employees bear some of the responsibility?” we agreed (why hadn’t we thought of this sooner?) and wrote the companion Love It, Don’t Leave It book. Interestingly (or maybe not), Love It never gained the attention that Love ‘Em did, and organizations are still slow to address this issue.

It was hard to pick the top strategies (26 chapters matching the alphabet) listed in Love It, but, if pressed, I’d say that the route to helping yourself be more engaged is:",
"I know I gushed, over the course of several articles, about all the fabulous, intelligent, finger-on-the-pulse-of-the-future, women I interacted with at the Blockchain conference earlier this year, but can we revisit just once more? Because this time of year is introspective and nostalgic. The falling leaves cause us to think about the coming months, and naturally, we predict what those months will hold for us. I am not immune, and my predictions generally fall into the realm of business, technology, design, or all three. Which is why I am declaring 2019 the year of intentional inclusion.

There's No Longer Space for Bias Here

Danielle Barnes, the CEO of Women Talk Design took notice of the lack of inclusion when it comes to diverse speakers on the speaking circuit, and I want to share with you some of the profound points we discussed on intentional inclusion, diversity, what we can do, and why it's important. Women Talk Design has been getting a makeover since 2017. What first began as a directory for women speakers in design and tech is now branching out into partnerships to get that directory working for the women  listed on it. If women make up half the population, but only a small percentage of the paid keynote speakers, eventually we all have to admit, that statistically, this can no longer be random. Instead, we should call it bias. And the solution to bias is intentional inclusion.

Barnes believes some of this continued bias occurs because organizers have a lot on their plates, run low on time, and rely on the same network to pull speakers and keynotes from. This routine leaves little space for new diverse stars to be born into the speaking circuit, perpetuating the cycle of bias.

Organizers have two options when it comes to expanding into more diversity  and inclusion. The first option is to have an offsite team who can help ease blind spots you may have when it comes to diversity. You can rely on this  team to assist you in creating a lineup that represents all of your conference attendees, not just half of them. The second option is to spend time growing your network, so when it comes time to hire a speaker or keynote, you can pull from a wide range of options, not the same three rotating around the scene with organizers you know and rely on for referrals.

Intentional inclusion requires you to be intentional, and to be aware about your role in playing gatekeeper to an entire profession that is currently suffering a heavy bias. That means not just hiring the guy your buddy, who is also a gatekeeper, told you about, or not just hiring the person you relate to most, or who looks the most like you. Diversity is only daunting to those who lack awareness. Inclusion benefits everyone, in perspective, in knowledge, in experiences, in potential, and so much more.

Step Four: Know Your Resources

Just like the Women Talk Design directory and offerings, it's important for you to know what resources are available out there to help you be the most effective in your role while making progress.

As you design a more inclusive route, be sure to share those experiences, refer those diverse speakers, and talk about your progress. These conversations help ease the burden of bias, allowing us to be honest and thoughtful about where we are going, and the work we still have left to do. 2019 is the year of intentional inclusion because we are capable of this, and no less.",
"The new year is just around the corner, and many entrepreneurs like to use this time of year to perk up any elements of their business that are getting stale or outdated. This is especially true among e-commerce businesses, which must keep up with the latest web design and user experience trends to attract customers and boost sales.

Of course, you don't want to pour time, energy and resources into a website overhaul if you don't truly need one. If you're not sure whether your online storefront needs a refresh, take a look at how these eight entrepreneurs made the decision. It's time to upgrade your site if the following signs sound familiar.

Your company is growing and evolving.

""When we introduce new products or services and our audience changes, we change the site's imagery, layout, copy, branding and messaging to ensure it resonates with our audiences,"" says Kristin Kimberly Marquet, founder and creative director of Creative Development Agency, LLC.

Your website doesn't match the quality of your product or service.

""We recently overhauled our own site because it didn't do justice to the work we were producing,"" Mathew explains. ""When a large gap emerges between how you look online and offline, it's time.""

Your mobile UX and site speed are lacking.

By now, most business owners know that a top-notch website experience is essential. However, some still haven't invested in upgrading their mobile UX, despite a growing number of customers making mobile purchases.

""Take a look at your analytics and compare sales coming from desktop versus sales coming from mobile devices,"" says Amine Rahal, founder of IronMonk. ""As consumers are increasingly shopping online through mobile devices, business owners can no longer ignore their mobile speed and UX.""

Syed Balkhi, founder of WPBeginner, believes a clear indicator that your website needs help is a low sales conversion rate. ""If you are spending a decent amount of marketing dollars, but not enough users are converting into customers when they land on your page, it's time to reevaluate,"" he says.

He recommends using Google Analytics to see where your users are dropping off the most and improving those pages first.

Your analytics are showing issues and declining traffic.

As you explore your website analytics, you may find there are other issues that need your attention. Declining traffic, outdated content and low speeds are just a few red flags to look for, according to Brandon Stapper, CEO of Nonstop Signs.

""Google Analytics and Insights will show you what you need to know,"" he says. ""It's important to monitor this continuously to determine when changes need to be made.""

Your site is simply an imitation of your competitors' pages.

According to Nicole Munoz of Nicole Munoz Consulting, Inc., being another cookie-cutter e-commerce website won't do you any favors. New startups, she says, are especially prone to the idea that imitation will lead to success.

""As a result of that mentality, their own brand becomes highly diluted and lacks the unique value that will resonate with an audience,"" Munoz explains. ""To push past this, seek out a deeper understanding of symbolic messages and how to convey them through your brand.""

Customers are asking you how to navigate or use your website.

Andrew Schrage, CEO of Money Crashers Personal Finance, reveals that you'll know your customers need a better UX when you get a lot of questions regarding navigational issues, such as where to go to perform a particular action.

Your site is more about your company than your customer.",
"When Warren Buffett and Bill Gates sat down together with TV host Charlie Rose, it could have easily resulted in a discussion of heady topics like investment strategy. Instead, it veered toward the profoundly simple.

During the segment, Gates revealed that one of the biggest lessons he's learned from Buffett revolves around time management. Buffett keeps a very light calendar, often having days where he has nothing scheduled. Gates, on the other hand, often has his schedule packed to the minute, so it was a humbling lesson on the true value of time, he said.

""You control your time. ... sitting and thinking may be a much higher priority,"" Gates said. ""It's not a proxy of your seriousness that you've filled every minute in your schedule.""

From there, Buffett went on to say that he could buy anything he wanted--except time, making it the most precious resource we have.

Of course, one could argue that for billionaires, even time is for sale, but we could probably agree that for the most part, when your time is up, it's up (at least for now).

However, not being able to buy time doesn't mean we can't optimize our own.

What you're getting: As an employer, this means getting people who take the initiative, who understand your vision, and whom you won't need to micromanage. As an employee, this means working in an organization where you're trusted and valued--a situation in which you can actually grow.

What you're giving up: Convenience--because, frankly, it's easier to surround yourself with the wrong people than the right ones.

What you're giving up: The illusion of superpowers, for one, but also a sense of control. We tend to think that if we just solve a few more problems today, our life will be easier tomorrow. In reality, sleeping less than seven hours a night just makes the next day harder, and ironically, shortens the life that we're trying so hard to build.

What you're getting: Higher output due to less time wasted figuring out what's next, and less time procrastinating. Of course, this means not just making a schedule but also sticking to it.

What you're giving up: The feeling of freedom. But in some ways, too much freedom can definitely be a bad thing. We all need some degree of structure, and scheduling is one way of figuring out the right amount.",
"Everyone wants immediate results, but that's rarely the case, regardless of whether you're attempting to lose weight, improve revenue, or develop as a leader. That's because results, especially the ones with a lasting impact, are the byproduct of doing the right things each and every day.

1. You read a book or listen to a podcast daily.

The daily habit of reading books or listening to educational podcasts isn't an easy one to adopt with so many entertainment options at your fingertips. But you have broken the spell of watching Netflix every night or listening to music during your commute because you know leaders are readers. You are constantly reading or listening to a new business book in order to expand your knowledge and engage your mind. While this practice might not pay off immediately, there is no doubt it will in 2019 and beyond.

2. You are proactive in shaping your team's culture.

You don't take culture for granted. In fact, you are constantly molding it in a positive direction because you know who's ultimately responsible for it. I have come to define culture this way: the shared values and beliefs that guide thinking and behavior. Culture is everything to a team, and while everyone on the team plays a part in the ongoing development of the culture, it's the leader's responsibility to create and mold it.

If you are going to excel in 2019, this is exactly the place your heart needs to be when thinking about your people. I spent some time last week with one of the best managers I have ever met, and when I asked him his secret to being a great manager, his answer surprised me. He responded, ""All I do is love my people."" Before you get your human resources flag out, love is ""to contribute to someone's long-term success and well-being"" in the Ultimate Leadership Academy.

4. You no longer have favorites.

We are naturally drawn to people who look and act like us. It's easy to put those people on a pedestal and treat them differently than others. You have learned to reject the old saying ""she reminds me so much of myself,"" and instead create strong relationships with every member of your team. Each and every team member has to live up to the same standards, and you hold them equally accountable.

5. You stopped measuring yourself by how much you make.

The easiest way for anyone to define themselves is the almighty dollar. The great Benjamin Franklin famously said, ""Money never made a man happy yet, nor will it. The more a man has, the more he wants. Instead of filling a vacuum, it makes one.""

While you care about how much money you make, you won't let it define you. At the end of the year, instead of evaluating your total compensation, you evaluate how well you elevated others to become the best versions of themselves.

6. You start your day with purpose.

Apple CEO Tim Cook wakes up at 3:45 to get his day started the right way. Many other great leaders do the same. Former Vanguard Group chairman and CEO Bill McNabb said, ""The quiet time between 6 a.m. and 7:30 a.m. is when some of my best work gets done. It's my time to read, think, and prepare for the day ahead. I try really hard to preserve that time.""

You also understand the importance of starting your day with purpose. You make sure you have at least 30 minutes to pray, meditate, read, or write. By doing so, you allow your day to start on a positive note that carries you the rest of the day.

7. You ask your people for feedback.",
"The eight-hour workday harkens back to 19-century socialism. When there was no upper limit to the hours that organizations could demand of factory workers, American labor unions fought hard to instill a 40-hour work week. But so much has changed since then. The internet fundamentally changed the way we live, work, and play, and the nature of work itself has transitioned in large part from algorithmic tasks to heuristic ones that require critical thinking, problem-solving, creativity, and uninterrupted stretches of time to get into a state of flow. How can you foster a shorter, more productive workday for your own team? Make it okay for employees to not be in a hyper-responsive state. Encourage employees to turn off notifications and batch-check e-mails. Block off time in calendars to allow for several hours of uninterrupted work each day. Cut your default meeting time from 60 minutes to 30 minutes. By cultivating a flow-friendly workplace and introducing a shorter workday, you’re setting the scene not only for higher productivity and better outcomes, but for more motivated and less-stressed employees, improved rates of employee acquisition and retention, and more time for all that fun stuff that goes on outside of office walls, otherwise known as life.

The eight-hour workday harkens back to 19-century socialism. When there was no upper limit to the hours that organizations could demand of factory workers, and the industrial revolution saw children as young as six-years-old working the coal mines, American labor unions fought hard to instill a 40-hour work week, eventually ratifying it as part of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938.

So much has changed since then. The internet fundamentally changed the way we live, work, and play, and the nature of work itself has transitioned in large part from algorithmic tasks to heuristic ones that require critical thinking, problem-solving, and creativity.

Adam Grant, organizational psychologist and New York Times bestselling author of Originals: How Non-Conformists Move the World, says that “the more complex and creative jobs are, the less it makes sense to pay attention to hours at all.” Yet despite all of this, the eight-hour workday still reigns supreme. “Like most humans,” Grant says, “leaders are remarkably good at anchoring on the past even when it’s irrelevant to the present.”

Heuristic work requires people to get into the physiological state of flow, coined by Hungarian-American psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi in 1975. Flow refers to the state of full immersion in an activity, and you might know it best as “the zone.” A 10-year McKinsey study on flow found that top executives are up to 500% more productive when they’re in a state of flow. A study by scientists at Advanced Brain Monitoring also found that being in flow cut the time it took to train novice marksmen up to an expert level in half.

Many of today’s organizations sabotage flow by setting counter-productive expectations on availability, responsiveness, and meeting attendance, with research by Adobe finding that employees spend an average of six hours per day on email. Another study found that the average employee checks email 74 times a day, while people touch their smartphones 2,617 times a day. Employees are in a constant state of distraction and hyper-responsiveness.

Jason Fried, co-founder of Basecamp and author of It Doesn’t Have to Be Crazy at Work, said on my podcast, Future Squared, that for creative jobs such as programming and writing, people need time to truly think about the work that they’re doing. “If you asked them when the last time they had a chance to really think at work was, most people would tell you they haven’t had a chance to think in quite a long time, which is really unfortunate.”

The typical employee day is characterized by:

“People waste a lot of time at work,” according to Grant. “I’d be willing to bet that in most jobs, people would get more done in six focused hours than eight unfocused hours.”

Cal Newport, best-selling author of Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World, echoes Grant’s sentiments, saying that “three to four hours of continuous, undisturbed deep work each day is all it takes to see a transformational change in our productivity and our lives.”

Fried agreed, saying that he gets into flow for about half the day. “If you don’t get a good four hours of flow to yourself a day, putting more hours in isn’t going to make up for it. It’s just not true that if you stay at the office longer you get more work done.”

Despite advances in technology, and perhaps in large part because of it, many find themselves working well beyond 5 PM just to keep up with their workloads, but it doesn’t have to be that way.

How to Foster a Shorter, More Productive Workday

I conducted a two-week, six-hour workday experiment with my team at Collective Campus, an innovation accelerator based in Melbourne, Australia. The shorter workday forced the team to prioritize effectively, limit interruptions, and operate at a much more deliberate level for the first few hours of the day. The team maintained, and in some cases increased, its quantity and quality of work, with people reporting an improved mental state, and that they had more time for rest, family, friends, and other endeavors.

When I announced the experiment on LinkedIn, a connection responded with: “It’s nice in theory, but I can’t finish all of my tasks in six hours!” — as if all tasks were created equally. The law of nature that is the Pareto principle stipulates that about 20% of your tasks will create about 80% of the value, so it’s about focusing on those high-value tasks.

If you’re the manager of a small team with limited resources, take a moment to reflect on the following productivity techniques and remember that your job as a leader is to facilitate outcomes, not just the illusion of them.

Prioritize: Channel Pareto and focus on high-value tasks, aligned with both employee strengths and the team’s goals.

 Cut: Reduce or eliminate tasks that don’t add value. Cutting your default meeting time from 60 minutes to 30 minutes, turning off notifications, and batch checking your email are all incredibly effective places to start.

 Automate: If it’s a step-by-step process-oriented task, it can probably be automated, saving you from doing it yourself.

 Outsource: If it can’t be automated, it can probably be delegated or outsourced. You’re probably not being paid to work on $10-an-hour tasks.

 Test: A lot of time is wasted in paralysis analysis and on over-investing in the wrong things. Managers can avoid both through effective experimentation, measurement, and adapting accordingly.

 Start: Do whatever it takes to start your engine. Block out time in your calendar, work on one thing at a time, do the hardest thing first, try listening to binaural beats or use the Pomodoro technique, a time management method that uses a timer to break work down into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

Make it okay for employees to not be in a hyper-responsive state and schedule uninterrupted time to get into a state of flow. Similarly, make it not okay to be interrupting people on a whim. My team has a simple rule; if a team member has their headphones in, you are not to disturb them unless it absolutely, positively can’t wait (which is hardly ever, by the way). Doing so has been shown to decrease workplace stress, according to research by Gloria Mark at the University of California, which found that stress levels declined when email was taken away from U.S. Army civilian employees for five days, because they felt more in control of their working lives.

Some Things Are Worth Fighting For

By cultivating a flow-friendly workplace and introducing a shorter workday, you’re setting the scene not only for higher productivity and better outcomes, but for more motivated and less-stressed employees, improved rates of employee acquisition and retention, and more time for all that fun stuff that goes on outside of office walls, otherwise known as life.

Organizations are spending big money on digital transformation, but they could reap an immediate, and far more cost-effective transformational benefit just by changing the way they work, instead of what they use to work. Sure, it would be easy to pull out the “some great sentiments here, but it would never work in our organization” card, but some things are worth fighting for; ensuring that our people do their best work and live their best lives are certainly worth it.",wellness
"Today, more and more companies are focused on digital transformation initiatives. In a 2018 survey by Tech Pro Research, 70% of respondents indicated their companies had a digital transformation strategy in place or were working on one. Aside from “going paperless,” one of the key focus areas of digital transformation is automation where the goal is to make business operations more efficient, productive and scalable. In a 2018 IDG survey, introducing more automation to improve process efficiency was the top objective for digital transformation initiatives (64%).

By having machines perform repetitive, manual processes, organizations hope to streamline labor costs and have people focus on more strategic tasks. Research by the McKinsey consulting firm suggests that “as many as 45% of the activities individuals are paid to perform can be automated by adapting currently demonstrated technologies.” Furthermore, they predict automation could become a significant competitive advantage as the magnitude of the benefits are “between three and ten times the cost.” Agile start-ups have a unique opportunity to build digital automation into the fabric of their business processes. Meanwhile, existing companies are being forced to embrace these technologies before they’re disrupted by more digital-savvy newcomers.

However, as more firms invest in digital transformation initiatives, something critical is being overlooked. According to McKinsey, less than 30 percent of digital transformation initiatives succeed. In other words, more than 70% of these initiatives fail. The flashy promises of “faster”, “easier” and “cheaper” can overshadow a fundamental reason for automating something—driving business value. At the gooey, nougaty center of every digital transformation initiative you should always find a rich, decadent serving of value. Automation won’t typically create value on its own—it simply amplifies the value that’s already present.  If there’s little or no intrinsic value already, automation won’t magically transform it into something valuable. In order to drive more value from your digital transformation efforts, I’ll offer three value-centered tips:

The urban legend is Boston’s chaotic streets were created by paving the paths that had already been worn by cattle. With digital transformation, you introduce risk when you “pave” or digitalize business processes without questioning how effective or efficient they are. For example, in my career in analytics consulting, I’ve seen many instances where a company wants to streamline or automate a certain report. These reports are often difficult and time-consuming to generate so the technical teams are only too eager to have technology carry the load for them.

However, on many occasions when you talk to the business users, you find they’re not even using the reports. Because the reporting lacks key information the business really needs, automating the reports adds no tangible value—besides the time savings for the analytics team. Rather than “digitalizing the cowpaths,” first determine whether the existing processes are worth the automation effort. In the scenario I just highlighted, it may mean tailoring the report content to the business users’ needs BEFORE focusing on how to automate them.

When you start a digital transformation initiative, your vision for the project may be biased or clouded by the limitations of your current processes or legacy systems. Rather than defining an automation project by past constraints, you need to broaden your perspective to consider new possibilities that a digital approach can afford. For example, a media company wanted to automate a monthly spreadsheet-based report that aggregated data from 12 different advertising systems. At the end of each month, executives and managers would pore through the consolidated report for different insights into the business. The information was clearly valuable to this media organization, but it didn’t fully grasp what it could be doing with its data.

As the BI team started working on the initiative, they discovered the reporting could not only be streamlined, but it could be delivered on a DAILY basis. Now, they had to rethink what types of information should be shared on a daily basis as opposed to a monthly basis. In addition, due to the complexity and difficulty of assembling the monthly spreadsheet report, they had never tied targets to any of the metrics. Now, they had the ability to display pacing to targets and manage the business to those monthly goals. Simply automating this massive, unwieldly monthly report would have been a win, but the infusion of daily insights dramatically transformed how this media company operates. As you prepare for your next digital transformation initiative, try to take a broader perspective and weigh its full potential rather than just focusing on the immediate or obvious benefits.

In a fast-paced, digital environment, we’re often encouraged at the outset of a new initiative or program to consider how it will scale. On multiple occasions, I’ve been pressed by leaders on how my ideas were “going to scale.” By focusing on scalability or automation too early, good ideas may be dismissed before they’ve had a chance to prove their value or smothered to death by onerous requirements to be automated or scalable. Y Combinator founder Paul Graham advised start-ups to “do things that don’t scale.” Even though it sounds counterintuitive, it’s important to figure out how something is going to generate value before you task it with the burden of being scalable.

At the last Strata Data Conference in New York, data scientist Erin Coffman shared her experience in co-founding the Data University program at Airbnb. Initially, some people expected to have on-demand videos because this delivery method would be more flexible, convenient and scalable. However, Coffman quickly recognized the desire for on-demand content rarely translated into actual usage or effective learning. So instead, her team focused on building out a robust data education program based on in-person classes only (30 people per class)—and not immediately worrying about how it was going to scale. It was only after the program was successful that they focused on expanding the program by using a distributed “train the trainer” model. If the Airbnb team had placed an emphasis on scale first, the program may never have achieved the same success (hundreds of classes delivered with an average net promoter score of 60).

Value must be the soul of every digital transformation initiative. With every organization working on transforming their business processes with data, you can’t afford to have “soulless” digital projects that fail to deliver value. No company wants to be digitally disrupted by a competitor. However, real success with digital transformation may come down to those that can consistently drive value from their digital technology investments over time. After all, digital transformation is not a destination but a journey.",None
"My recent participation in a series of national conversations on good governance and civil discourse, which was jointly sponsored by the George Washington University Law School and the National Association of Parliamentarians (NAP), has prompted considerable reflection. Introspective thought often occurs in December when the calendar-year speeds to closure. A seeming wave of polemic events, including vitriolic political communications, along with inflammatory rhetoric that arguably led to the shootings in Pittsburgh and Kentucky, dominates my reflection and reveals an existential problem in our complex democracy: the erosion of civil discourse.

Masked under a free speech rubric, individuals increasingly engage in caustic, hyperbolic and even discourteous rhetoric stimulated by increased political polarization. The backlash against political correctness has fueled reliance on the First Amendment as justification to speak one's mind regardless of negative effects. The right to speak freely has resultantly become a moniker for unabashed expressive behavior without any acceptance of the accompanying responsibility to exercise that right respectfully. As a result, individuals talk at, rather than to, one another. Uncivil discourse becomes a seemingly accepted norm and a cathartic weapon that galvanizes personally held beliefs. It also motivates like-minded individuals while alienating others with a different point of view.

Fortunately, 2018 ushered in a groundswell of focus on civility and its commensurate essentiality to a productive and meaningful exchange. NAP, together with GW Law, launched the Great Conversation series, in which panels of distinguished professionals nationwide engage in a lively discussion of civility’s merits. My participation in the first of these panels took place last week as the holiday season accelerated into full tilt. My contribution to the inaugural panel in this series built upon my continued crusade to implore educators to inculcate in students the virtues of civil discourse. As my May 2018 article, “In Praise of Civility” in The Atlantic emphasized, persuasion dissipates when incivility dominates.

Year-end reflections can often inspire thoughts of a more restorative new year. In the case of civility, I have great hope that its merits will be trumpeted throughout 2019. Certainly, NAP and GW Law, through their jointly sponsored Great Conversation, will lead the charge. A dominant point in this discussion is that civility constitutes a foundational element of professionalism, which is a vital attribute for success in the 21st century. To this end, I offer the following precepts that, if adopted, should lead to more civil exchanges:

I remain cautiously optimistic that the acrimonious rhetoric that has dominated headlines throughout 2018 will ultimately give way to a greater focus on civility in 2019. Educators and civic leaders must strongly promote civil discourse as a construct of constructive engagement, thereby maximizing the communication of ideas and the broadening of minds. If civility becomes an accepted norm, perhaps the often-cited phrase, ""Peace on Earth, Goodwill Toward [All],"" will morph from mere platitude to reality.",
"We all know that our world has changed dramatically in the past five years – with a massive increase in digital connection and a vast decrease in live or person-to-person communication. How has this shift affected our levels of true connection and what can we do to strengthen our bonds with the people we live and work with?

Here to answer that question is , the co-founder of We and Me, Inc., an organization whose mission is to create conversations that matter. As an author and TEDx speaker, Chad is called on by leaders and organizations who want a dynamic expert speaker, mentor and facilitator to help create a culture of connection and effective communication.

Littlefield and Will Wise co-founded We and Me to break down communication barriers and to increase trust, connection, and engagement at work. Here's what Littlefield shares about exactly how to connect more meaningfully with others starting today:

Kathy Caprino: Chad, it seems many of us we actually failing to connect in a meaningful way with others, despite our living in a hyper-connected world. Why is it so hard to connect in positive ways?

Chad Littlefiled: Actually, we are trying to connect. We are starving to connect. On average, we spend about “connected” through a screen. Sherry Turkle, researcher at MIT reminds us that the reality is that all these “ ” of online connection never actually add up to a “gulp” of human connection.

There are three major reasons why we are failing to connect — meaningfully.

First, we live in a culture of time famine

“Busy” is perhaps the most common response to “how are you?” anymore. The perception is that true human connection takes lots and lots of time. I disagree with this. Even so, when we don’t have time for something, it’s another way of saying “it’s not a priority for me right now.”

Second, there is a national curiosity deficit

This curiosity deficit prevents us from building trusting, healthy connections. With the sounding board of social media, it seems we speak more in declarative statements and less in questions. Questions are like keys that unlock the lifetime of un-Googleable experiences, differences, commonalities and connection points that we each carry in our minds.

There is no backspace, no “undo send” and no ability to draft a communication and consider the ramifications for a couple hours. Face-to-face, live conversation introduces us to social and emotional risk. Our brains are wired to avoid social and emotional risk in the same way we used to avoid saber tooth tigers. Neuroscientists have even found that “social pain” and physical pain activate the same regions in the brain . It’s easier to avoid social pain than it is to take the chance of connection.

Caprino: How can we shift from small ""bytes"" of connection to more meaningful connections?

Littlefield: The first step is to take . This is the simple act of stepping outside your comfort zone, wherever that might be, with the intention to create a genuine, human connection. After a while, we realize that our perceived social risk is almost always higher than the actual risk.  A great starting point: follow your curiosity with people.

Ask questions rooted in your natural, genuine curiosity. To get specific, here is a tool that has had a profound impact on my life. It’s taken from my co-founder, Will Wise’s, latest book,

This tool offers a socially safe way to access who somebody is because what we “wear, carry, or share” often reflects a personal choice of how we want to show up in the world. Often, not always, and this is where empathy comes into play.

Lastly, remember that curiosity is a choice — not a fixed trait. Like a bicep or tricep, curiosity can grow stronger or weaker. The more we ask questions, the more natural it becomes. Great questions fuel our conversations. Our conversations form the foundation for connection. Don’t get me wrong, there is much more to meaningful connection than simple asking questions. Listening, time for reflection, empathy, silence, nonverbals, etc. A conversation without self-disclosure is an interrogation. But paying attention to our questions is a great place to get started.

Caprino: What are three things leaders, managers and others can do to connect meaningfully and quickly with their teams?

Littlefield: For the busy managers and leaders out there, here is a one-minute, five-minute and 15-minute exercise to build trust and connection on their teams.

Be clear about your intention and share it. At the start of your next team meeting, one-to-one or off-site, share your intention with the group. As Wise discusses in his book, intention is the foundation for avoiding manipulation, which uproots trust and connection. Simply sharing an intention that includes the needs of the whole team serves as an invitation for everybody to play the same game.

Got an extra minute or two? Have each team member create their own intention to share with the group.

Peter Block says that “we must establish a personal connection with each other. Connection before content. Without relatedness, no work can occur.”

First, choose a question that connects to purpose, allows people to connect to each other, and creates space for authenticity and vulnerability. Then invite the team to divide into groups of three to discuss for a few minutes. Lastly, pull the group back together and ask the group to answer the question, “What struck you about those conversations?” This question has a powerful effect of aligning the team and creating a sense of community. ( explaining this five-minute ""connection before content"" exercise.)

This is my all-time favorite exercise to do with a group of 12 or more people. Perfect for team retreats or to kickoff a standing meeting. I’ve facilitated this specific exercise with well over 25,000 people and I have never had it flop.

Basically, you ask everyone to choose a question. We use a card deck that we developed but you can make your own out of 3x5 notecards. Then ask people to pair up with one other person to ask and answer the questions on their cards. Swap cards after each conversation and pair up with a new partner. It is a beautiful self-facilitating exercise that allows people to be in conversations as long or as little as they would like.

Caprino: So how does something that some managers and leaders would call ""fluffy"" or ""soft"" like connection or trust impact a company's bottom line?

Littlefield: In order to make time for it, it must be set as a strategic priority. If leaders need some hard evidence to make this happen, below is some key data on the trust gap and the power of connection.

On top of it all, trust and social connection is actually a key ingredient to building the “perfect team.” uncovered that the number one indicator of a high-performing, innovative team is the degree of psychological safety in that team. This is the academic way of saying “interpersonal trust.” That trust and sense of safety develops largely through social and personal connections.

These stats also align with from the Harvard Study of Adult Development. The director of this ongoing study, Dr. Waldinger, says that ""people who are more socially connected to family, friends, and community are happier, healthier and live longer than people who are less well connected."" Happy and healthy employees also tend to be loyal and productive employees.

Caprino: What about the role of ""small talk"" – that type of conversation we all engage in every day with people around us or at work who we don't feel close to, or even with those we do have a connection with. Does small talk hold any value?

Littlefield: This is a funny question because I feel quite strongly that the reason I’m on this planet is actually to “gently eradicate small talk.” Key word: gently. Even though very few people love small talk, we still find ourselves chit-chatting about the who knows what with some frequency.

The value of small talk is that it is safe. There is very little social or psychological risk in asking questions like, “What do you do?” or, ""Where are you from?” At the same time, low risk often means low reward.

Speaking of risk, ask an introvert or read or perspective on small talk, and you will realize that there is, in fact, a cost to unintentional conversation fueled by social obligation. This is where I believe we have the power to transform moments of small talk into moments of meaning. Empathetic curiosity can turn a mundane conversation into a surprise-filled dialogue. Even if you are talking about the weather or where you are from, I believe that a dose of empathetic curiosity can turn small talk into “big talk.”

On top of this,  published a study on over 20,000 audio recordings which found that people who had more authentic, substantive conversations also tended to be happier.

Caprino: So how can asking better questions get us to having more authentic, substantive conversations?

Littlefield: There is a that says knowledge of personal backgrounds of others leads to shortcuts for effective communication. How can we access information about people’s personal backgrounds? By asking questions that sparks connection. And asking intentional, empathetic questions that are rooted in our natural, genuine curiosity. Now that has the power to transform differences into connections.

The best way to break down communication barriers and increase connection, engagement, and trust on your teams is this: Start speaking less in periods and more in question marks.

"Almost a quarter of 18-34 year-olds have gone to work still feeling drunk after boozy nights out over the past year.

A survey of 2,000 UK workers by Willis Towers Watson (WTW) found that half of these workers admitted to having driven to work on these occasions. It also found that young workers are twice as likely as colleagues aged 35 and over to come into work still feeling drunk and that those older workers that do are less likely to drive into work on these occasions (44%).

Mike Blake, Well-being Lead at WTW, warned that these findings indicated that Britain’s youth were putting their safety and well-being, and potentially the safety of others, at risk.

With Christmas just around the corner and the party season starting, the likelihood of workers coming into work still feeling drunk increases. Companies should be looking at what they can do to support workers and educate them on the dangers of excessive drinking on work nights. Sensitive advice and guidance on attitudes towards alcohol and sensible drinking ranging from workshops to intranet resources can go a long way in helping to foster a responsible workplace culture.”

Almost a fifth of workers (19%) said that their employer’s culture had contributed towards unhealthy levels of drinking by encouraging alcohol consumption during staff nights out and by promoting a work hard, play hard culture. Just one in 10 employees said their employer provided them with health advice on alcohol consumption, however.

The morning after also has a damaging effect on productivity, with 27% of workers reporting that they have hangovers on a monthly basis that affect their ability to do their job. One in four 18- to 34-year-olds has taken sick days due to hangovers, compared to 13% over the age of 35. More than a third of all workers taking time off due to hangovers admitted the reason for their absence to their boss.

Blake advised that companies should be setting out to identify if alcohol misuse is a problem among their employees and, where necessary, review and revise well-being strategies to establish appropriate and effective support and intervention initiatives.",
"Employees happiness in the workplace is not just fashionable but also proven to be worthwhile. As many others already, a study conducted by Andrew Oswald, Eugenio Proto, and Daniel Sgroi at the University of Warwick expose how productivity increases on happy employees by an average of 12% what in regards to GDP and economic growth would mean a significant 3% general rise. “Having scientific support for generating happiness-productivity cycles within the workforce should help managers to justify work-practices aimed at boosting happiness on productivity grounds,” concludes Dr. Sgroi.

Leading companies are beginning to take it very seriously. When Carlien Van den Bril, current CHO at Yuki met the Director Manager of this software startup, she came with an appealing proposal that will transform the culture of a business ready to scale up. It was time to extend and enrich the traditional HR functions into a powerful tool to nurture and boost the company's culture and results. It was time for a Chief Happiness Officer.

""Small things are those things that have a great impact on the well-being and happiness at work"" explains Carlien. ""My role is to make sure that everybody is engaged in the company and by feeling passionate about the company, that everybody is able to be happy within the company.""

But employees do not engage by themselves. The company needs to work on it starting with a culture that should be fed by proper management. This culture opens up since the very first steps of recruitment. ""When I call someone for an interview I always conduct it on the bases of career guidance. This approach will help the person I am interviewing to better understand the reasons and the alternative ways forward behind a possible refusal. In a most positive scenario, it will help the future employees to feel from the very beginning that this company is a place that will help them to grow."" (Carlien)

Once the lucky and happy employee is on board, the Chief Happiness Officer is responsible for team satisfaction, understood as the sum up of individual happy and healthy employees, successfully aligned with their roles and responsibilities. With the Engagement Bridge model as the starting point, Chief Happiness Officers will take care of 7 first lines when making employees happy.

Pays and benefits should be according to the market to ensure basic levels of satisfaction within the company. As supporting trunk of the engagement pyramid, there is no happy employee without the proper balance of them. If your SMEs or startup if struggling on this point, have in mind the 3 main pillars that make good employees jump into your business jungle: a great company culture, a successful role alignment and a fair paid. Make sure to engage them with the proper balance of them.

Taking care of the physical and mental wellbeing of employees is at the very bottom of the engagement bridge. Once the work basics such us computers, desk, and chairs and proper needed working tools are in place, additional projects around this point can be quite broad and require typically very little investment of budget and time. Organize sporadic healthy breakfast to give a sense of the importance and impact of good habits. Make available for employees the contact of personal trainers or coaches. Arrange discounts in a nearby gym as part of employees benefits. Ensure that fresh fruits are every morning offered in the coffee corner. These are simple examples of small actions that have a significant impact on peoples wellbeing at work.

Every employee needs to feel like a 1/X part of the entire team. To feel valued, people need to understand the direct or indirect link between what they are doing and the whole picture. There is nothing more disengaging that realizing there is no real need for your job. Open communication is vital to ensure a harmonious teamwork and quickly scalable outputs. Weekly, monthly or quarterly cross-functional team meetings focusing on progress, future goals and mistakes to learn about are very well rated tools by employees. Make sure that these moments create an engaging environment where the team learns from each other in a free space of detailed and constructive criticism.

Whether if the business is big or small, every employee should be clearly aware of the purpose, mission, and values of the company. If employees are not able to inspire their work with the company values, sooner than later, they will lose the sense of what they are doing. Passion for driving a change; fun with what we are doing, entrepreneurship allowing employees to try their ideas out; customer focus to increase the sales; fair trade to positively impact the environment, etc.  Have them visibly picked and defined. There is nothing more potent that meaning and sense.

Happy and productive employees require a real alignment between management and leadership. Leaders make the whole team row in the same direction. Average bosses make just people obey. Ensuring to set in place real leading management structures is at the core of employee's happiness. A top-down approach and flexible standards are great tools for positive leadership. But there is a huge need to get it right. The top-down approach does not mean lack of clear hierarchy, roles, and structure. Flexibility does not mean a lack of rules and schedules. Clear frameworks in place are as needed in a business as in a growing child. Without defined lines of actions and practices to follow there is no path to walk. And without a way to walk, there is no reachable destination. Ensuring the creation of a harmonious team able to enjoy a flexible approach to work and open and free communication with the management structures requires clear frameworks of actions applicable to all as the starting point.

A Chief Happiness Officer is the supporting mechanism for employees that may be experiencing both personal or professional challenges. Moving to a new house, having a new baby, going through difficult personal or family health situation or struggling with any of our professional tasks assigned are situations we all humans go through somewhen in life. Flexibility is not just a matter of working times. Flexibility also means to feel supported, encouraged and understood by your company when hard times arrive.

Setting in place flexible roles vs. statics functions is vital to ensure that everybody is realizing their talents while fulfilling their job. A job can be difficult or challenging, but it can never be boring. Make sure that within the setup structures, you are creating individual roles for each employee. Role-mapping activities within the team could help to define one or more roles per employee from their strengths with the aim to ensure that everybody gets enough energy with the tasks they are performing.

Enabling learning opportunities will support a job designing approach as well as increase your employee's happiness and productivity. Whenever is possible, create an education budget line to spend per employee that they can use according to their learning needs or professional/personal circumstances. Scheduled also smart sessions devoted to learning from each other talents.

Feeling good at the workplace goes through enjoy clear recognition of your work by the different members of your team and the company itself. Various tools can be introduced among employees to ensure easy ways to give and receive feedback and praises.

Chief Happiness Officers are needed! Our workplace is our second home, and our team is our second family. There is no way to enjoy a happy and fulfilling life if we do not feel comfortable every morning when crossing the main entrance of the company building. Bring a CHO to your crew and set up in place a full range of different projects to ensure employees engagement and satisfaction. There is a new way to do business. It cost small investment, and it brings great results.",
"As the month of December rolls by, it’s typical for many of us to start reflecting on the past year. We review our accomplishments, reexamine our setbacks and perhaps look wistfully at our “year in review” posts on Facebook. And then, as the month comes to a close, we begin setting our sights on the year to come.

Companies are no different. December is often the month for annual performance reviews. There’s likely to be many closed-door meetings between management and the executives in human resources. And as harsh as it sounds, you’ll probably have some awareness of these meetings, but unfortunately, you won't be invited to any of them—and this is doubly true when assessing whether you should be promoted or not becomes the topic of discussion.

You’ve worked hard this year. You’ve burned the midnight oil many a night, and you’ve made some particularly valuable contributions. Maybe there’s been a blip or two along the way, but overall you’re anticipating a good review. Part of you hopes you’ll see your name in your company’s annual “employee promotions” announcement. If you’re really honest with yourself, you’re even looking forward to updating your LinkedIn profile with a new title. And why wouldn’t you? In the world of corporate hierarchy, promotions clearly establish your success. Each one is like a trophy, a reward given for effort and dedication. Or, at least, that’s how we’re told it works.

More realistically, many of us are overlooked at this time of year, no matter how well we’ve done our job. Which begs the question: Why do some of us get promoted more often than others, and what are your colleagues doing to earn those coveted title changes faster than you? The answer is simple: they ask. Those who climb their way up the ladder that much more quickly understand the importance of advocating for themselves.

Neglecting to self-advocate is a common issue, and the reasons behind this omission can be complex. You might’ve been taught as a child that self-promotion is rude or selfish, even though in adulthood—without parents or teachers guiding you—rarely will anyone notice your talents unless you make the effort to stand out. Or it’s possible that your self-esteem waxes and wanes: sometimes it’s a little too easy to listen to your critical, doubt-filled inner voice, the one that says you’re not really ready for the next step. Fear of change can play a part, too. If you’re comfortable and confident in your current role, it can be scary to wade into the unknown of a new position.

Even though the reason(s) keeping you from self-advocating are probably personal, the bottom line is the same: in a corporate culture, if you want something, you have to get it for yourself. And that means clearly stating your needs and making your voice heard, even if you’re not totally comfortable tooting your own horn.

Putting yourself front and center in the workplace can be tough. Here are three tips to make self-advocacy a little easier.

Draw Your Roadmap Early And Consult It Often

If you want a promotion, start at the beginning of the year. Ask your manager what it’s going to take to get you to the next level, then sit down with her and outline a plan for achieving these goals.

Throughout the year, during your one-on-one meetings, reserve a few minutes now and again for revisiting those goals. Ask your manager for her general thoughts on what you’ve done well or what you could do better, and if you know you need help in a particular area, ask for it. Don’t make your performance the focus of these meetings—updates on your everyday projects should still be your main priority—but do make it clear that these mini-assessments are important to you and your career.

In Mindset: The New Psychology of Success, psychologist Carol Dweck tells us that a growth mindset—the belief that we can cultivate and improve upon our personal traits—is essential for success. In other words, Dweck asserts that all of us have the potential to change for the better; we can consciously effect that change. What are the key traits of a growth mindset? Embracing challenges, persisting in the face of setbacks, viewing effort as a necessary part of mastering a goal, being open to, and learning from, criticism and finding inspiration in the success of others rather than being intimidated by it.

A growth mindset will affect your performance in deep, positive ways. When your manager asks you to tackle a special project, rather than thinking you’re being targeted for extra work, you’ll embrace the chance to excel. You’ll look to your colleagues for advice if you hit a roadblock, instead of giving into frustration. You’ll think of the time spent on the project as a valuable learning opportunity. And when you turn in your work but your manager asks for revisions, you’ll use her feedback to improve while trusting that her success could someday be yours.

With a growth mindset, you can squelch self-doubt, boost self-esteem and approach your goals with a new determination. When growth itself is your underlying focus, self-advocating will become that much easier.

People who get promoted are typically not toiling away in the back room unnoticed. They don’t sit quietly in their cubicles hoping for words of praise. They don’t shy away from taking credit where credit is due. If anything, they do the exact opposite, and they do it by design.

To make yourself more visible, first identify ways of becoming more active within your role, then actively showcase your efforts. When you’re putting extra hours into an assignment, when your contribution leads to a successful new project-direction, when you’re mentoring a new hire, when you’re leading a group team, when you’re attending an optional seminar or training course, make it a point to tell your manager about it. Write her an email explaining how you’re going above and beyond and outline how the skills you’re honing are relevant to your current position—and to future ones.

Your manager will always have a lot on her plate—she’s not looking for quiet rising stars, she’s busy with her own responsibilities and deadlines. In fact, she may not even know the ins-and-outs of your job on a micro level, never mind being able to identify the areas where you truly stand out. Self-advocacy isn’t bragging: it’s educating your manager about your strengths and drive to succeed. In fact, by taking the guesswork out of evaluating your performance, you’re actually making her job easier.

Patience is a virtue, but not necessarily in the corporate world; waiting for your next promotion to come to you will only stall your career. Regardless of your performance review results this December, it’s not too early to begin planning ahead. Start the new year with a fresh outlook. When you practice self-advocacy, you become an active part of the promotion and reignition process all year round.",
"Viewed through the lens of a glass half full, Europe’s cash-hungry startups have never had it so good. According to a report published last month by Dealroom.co, investment in early stage companies is currently taking place at four times the level recorded in 2012.

But that doesn't mean raising capital is easy. Hard on the heels of that report, is a new analysis carried out by Early Metrics, a Paris-based company that rates the potential of startups using a range of non-financial measures. And according to the Early Metrics number crunchers, early stage companies often struggle to raise the sums they need - or think they need.

Pre-revenue companies - fare the worst. On average, they secure just 74% of the sum they set out to obtain. In contrast, those who have begun to generate revenues through the sale of products or services raise, on average, 91% of the sum required. Overall, more than half (53%) of the startups tracked by Early Metrics secured less money than they expected.

None of this should really be a surprise. We are, after all, talking about very early stage businesses and by the very nature of the beast, success over the long and medium term is difficult to predict. And as Early Metrics Founder Antoine Baschiera points out, that makes it difficult for startups and investors alike to pin down the appropriate numbers.

“For startups it’s very tricky to forecast exactly how much capital will be needed to grow and how high to aim when it comes to fundraising,” he says, “It’s equally difficult for investors to balance their ambition in terms of returns versus the risks that come with investing in young ventures. That’s why we still see a significant difference between the sums targeted by startups and the actual results of their fundraising.”

So does that leave a majority of startups wrestling with an unsustainable shortfall in funding? Well perhaps.

The Dealroom.co report - Journey to Series A in Europe - which I reported on in October, suggested there was a direct correlation between substantial early stage/seed funding and the ability of startups to progress to Series A. $2.5m was seen as the optimal amount to raise at the seed stage - a sum that would allow a startup to forget the worries of fundraising for 18-24 months and concentrate on growing the business.

The Early Metrics research views the issue from a slightly different perspective. The report notes that, on average, startups set out to raise an average  £985,000. In reality the average secured comes  in at £815,000. In other words, there isn’t really a huge gap between the aspirations of the entrepreneurs and reality of what investors are prepared to offer.

“The gap between goal and reality is not as big as you would think. This could be a sign that the fundraising process is getting professionalized and entrepreneurs are becoming savvier,” says Baschiera.

There is, of course, the open question of whether management teams are seeking enough money in the first place. As Early Metrics’ research notes, it is not always easy for founders to fully appreciate how much capital they will really need to bring a product to market. Sometimes an entrepreneur will realize too late that the sum he or she is seeking is not going to be enough.

And this, in turn, can put investors in a difficult position. If it is apparent that the sum asked for is not sufficient to deliver on key milestones, potential backers may shy away from a situation that could require further fund raising rounds and a possible dilution of their own shareholding. Or, they might offer more money up front, but naturally enough ask for a bigger stake in the business.

It’s All About The Timing

So it is clearly going to be helpful to the negotiation process if  founders can present investors with a clearly defined business case and as with so many things in life, timing is important. “How and when to raise funds for a new venture is both complex and crucial in equal parts. Many set out on this mission too early, so they cannot present investors with a compelling business case to seal the deal,” says Baschiera.

And founders should bear in mind that even at the pre-revenue stage, there are factors that will improve their chances of raising the money they require. As Early Metrics sees it, complementary skills across the management team, evidence of good financial management, a product that is genuinely innovative, and the company’s presence in on social media are all key.",
"Not too long ago I was speaking to a colleague and friend who is seeking to create a new business opportunity for himself after reflectively reevaluating his life. During our conversation, we came to the fundamental ingredient for success in business -- and also life.

When we're true to our core values and keep them front and center, despite the busyness and the challenges that inevitably arise, we can move the ball forward. But when we lose sight of our values or give up on them because it's expedient, we often end up frustrated or confused, which doesn't help us achieve our goals and objectives.

Multiple Companies And Brands, One Core Value

I’m fortunate to have several businesses and even more brands that continually keep me challenged as an entrepreneur. But, no matter what the businesses or brand positions are, there is one core value that courses through all of them: exceptional (not just excellent) customer service. My core value is having meaningful relationships, and that value is infused into every part of my business and personal life. But I'm not the only one. Core values are a driver for some of the biggest successes.

Many people enjoy the movies, and in July 2018, Forbes reported that Dwayne Johnson was the highest paid actor in Hollywood. Not too long ago, a Huffington Post article noted that if you watch any of his movies, there is always one value that connects them all -- family. For Dwayne Johnson, when he chooses to make a film, he wants it to have an element of family so that it speaks to the hearts of people who watch it and helps people to become invested in the film characters.

Amazon is one of the top companies in the world, but it started as an online bookstore. However, I believe Amazon's incredible success happened because of its well-known and relentless focus on the customer. They probably know their clients better than those people know themselves. The company is operated with 14 Leadership Principles, as explained in Inc., but one of their core values -- focus on the customer -- is chief among them to such an extent that they call it a ""customer obsession.""

Staying true to your core values will likely never steer you or your company wrong. That's because, from a business perspective, they help you convey the vision of your company to others. From a daily operational perspective, defining and having a sharp focus on your core values helps create the company culture that you want and ripples out to the way everyone on your team engages with prospective customers and clients. The following tips are three ways to develop your focus on your core values.

1. Decide how to spend the resources of money and time. One of the ways that you can become clear about your core values often begins with how your company spends the resources of money and time because it says a lot about your priorities -- both in your business and as an entrepreneur. Dedicate money and spend time on a weekly basis in settings such as development meetings or training sessions with your team to address the areas of your business that are a priority. For my companies and brands, there are two places where a significant amount of money and time are spent. One is in our marketing efforts, where we make it a point to demonstrate our commitment to excellence and leadership in the industry sectors in which we operate. Secondly, we train and expect our team to deliver an exceptional customer experience for each and every one of our customers on all of the interactions they have with the companies and brands, especially in challenging moments.

2. Collaborate with and encourage those who share your values. Both in business and life, I believe you are usually the company you keep. Once you've defined and are clear about the core values of your company, you should maintain a sharp and relentless focus on them. In your business, that could mean rewarding the people who model the values and easing out individuals who don't support or run counter to values that are a fundamental part of your company. As an example, in one of my brands, we've instituted an ""employee of the year"" award that is accompanied by a bonus. Our first winner is someone who has modeled, excellently, our core value of exceptional service to our customers.

3. Pump up the volume on speaking about your values. In our fast-paced world, it's easy to put aside our core values because we have a mountain of things we have to achieve for the day. That approach is a mistake. For core values to bring you success, I've found that you have to make sure they're part of your daily focus and that of the team and people associated with your company. This means you should speak about the values in some way, shape or form each day. For instance, your core values can be threaded through the conversations you have and work you do with your team. When you have a new product or service, inform your team about how the new product or service supports the core values of the company during training, as well as in all-hands and departmental meetings. Also, you can measure your team on how their work helps support the values of the organization. If customer experience is a core value, for example, how do your team members measure up in achieving the value on a daily basis?

Core values shape your business and life, but to use them to help achieve your goals, they should be a consistent part of your everyday professional life. Every day, you have to figure out ways to keep them front and center for both yourself and your team.",
"Let’s say your organization has had some success in providing coaching for your high-potential people, and there's interest in extending that coaching further through the ranks. For various reasons, there isn't the bench strength, budget or appetite to undertake the wholesale organizational and cultural overhaul required to convert to an integrated coaching culture.

Fortunately, there is. There are many examples of successful coaching initiatives that rely on leveraging your managers to become coaches for their staff. In particular, adopting coaching skills is a foundational piece of moving away from managing people toward leading them.

We recently worked with a global engineering firm that wanted to become a more agile organization. Part of their issue, and it’s not an uncommon one, is that their culture had always rewarded leaders who solved their people’s problems for them rather than coaching them to explore solutions themselves. It was clear that we had to start by helping their leaders develop coaching skills, though that sounds much simpler than it was because many of them struggled to not blurt out the answers. It took practice, coaching workshops and peer coaching circles that focused on real coaching situations. We also worked with employee teams to help them understand coaching and be more receptive participants in the process.

After several months of hard work, we started to see results. The organization reported that managers and leaders were demonstrating coaching skills more often. They were withholding solutions and, instead, asking questions and helping others think creatively about possibilities. As a result, there was better engagement, better problem solving and decision making, and more innovation. Ultimately, all those changes helped boost revenues.

As one of the leaders put it, ""I was very skeptical at first to take a coaching approach. I thought it would slow things down. I saw coaching as a waste of time and not my job. With pressure from the organization, I started to ask open-ended questions and not fire out answers. With this coaching approach, I began to notice that my direct reports were thinking more creatively and making better decisions. They also told me they liked this new approach. How could I go back now to my old leadership style?""

For organizations to be successful and continually add value in the current social and economic climates, it’s important that all managers have a coaching style in how they lead people and manage tasks. Building on the work of Peter Hawkins, developing a coaching style for managers involves first developing an approach to leading that combines a performance orientation with a tacit responsibility and accountability for developing all staff to their fullest potential. The journey to creating a coaching culture only takes hold when the organization starts to develop coaching skills across all its leaders, including its leaders of tomorrow.

Organizations with a strong coaching culture build the development of core coaching skills into all aspects of their management training, from onboarding to training courses to the coaching and mentoring they receive on the job. In an International Coaching Federation survey (purchase required), 87% of respondents with strong coaching cultures reported their current training had been instrumental in building a coaching culture, versus 43% of all respondents.

Managers Using A Coaching Style To Lead Their Teams

Coaching is basically a way of engaging that encourages others to think through their challenges, engage with new perspectives and together generate new and innovative thinking and action that may elude people thinking on their own.

One of the most important shifts necessary for a team leader is to realize the difference between managing a team versus leading a team. This also means they have to develop the skills to coach the entire team and not just the individual team members. In a coaching culture, team leaders see coaching as a key aspect of their role, using skills to coach their direct reports and to empower the team to perform more than simply the sum of its parts. This kind of success relies on leaders building on foundational coaching skills and developing advanced coaching skills:

One of the best things about developing this kind of coaching mindset is the value it brings to the organization. Leaders who take a coaching approach to their leadership give their company a distinct competitive advantage. While some may view coaching as a soft skill, there are tangible bottom-line results to support its significance. Organizations with strong coaching cultures benefit from more highly engaged employees (62% in strong coaching cultures compared to 50% in other organizations) and increased revenue growth (51% in strong coaching cultures compared to 38% in other organizations), as highlighted in the International Coaching Federation survey above.

If you know that your organization has to change or adapt to the changing economics and dynamics of this world, you will reach those goals more quickly and effectively if you move away from being a company that offers coaching to a company with a coaching culture. Your people truly are a resource for innovation and problem solving, but you’ll see much better results if you give your leaders the skills to coach them to be the best they can be.",
"Not all freelancers are created equal, and trust me when I say that no one knows this better than the people trying to hire one. As the owner of Transcription Outsourcing, I’ve hired dozens of freelancers over the years, and I’ve learned that there are a lot of red flags to avoid when hiring freelancers, no matter their specialty.

If you’re looking to build your client base or keep the one that you already have as a freelancer, it’s important to avoid setting off one of these red flags that can keep you from getting the contract. And if you’re looking to hire a freelancer, you’ll want to watch out for these as well.

They have no evidence of performance.

It’s easy to make big claims on the internet -- it’s why there are an awful lot of unemployed “life coaches” running around. In order to avoid contractors who lack the skills they say they have, watch out for the ones who can’t show you evidence of happy clients.

Sometimes freelancers will sign nondisclosure agreements or work as ghost consultants, so they may not always be able to show you everything they’ve ever created or detailed stats on performance. That being said, look for portfolios, samples of work or even positive reviews on LinkedIn. If the freelancer you’re looking to hire can’t show you anything to prove they’ve done any decent work in the field, take it as a warning sign.

They don’t seem to ask the right questions.

Unless you have an exceptionally detailed onboarding system, most of the people you hire will ask questions -- even the ones who can be trusted to take an assignment and hit the ground running.

Even self-starters should be asking some smart questions. Graphic designers might ask you if there are examples or styles of logos that you like; transcriptionists can ask about language style guides and freelance writers might ask about the goals of your content or your audience instead of writing without understanding.

Not asking the right questions doesn’t indicate independence -- it typically signals inexperience because it means they don’t even know the right questions to ask.

They say they can do everything.

While you may find an agency that’s a jack-of-all-trades, you typically want to avoid this with freelancers. One individual who enthusiastically insists they can do your SEO and your transcription and your copywriting and your photography is almost definitely not someone you want.

While it would be convenient, a single person with that many services won’t specialize in any of them. When you hire a freelancer, you want specialization.

Communication is important in any professional relationship, and it becomes even more important when you’re working with someone outside your team and likely outside your office.

Look for signs of poor communication skills, because they will make your life difficult. Are their emails poorly written, or do you need to follow up four times to get a response? Do they neglect to answer questions, or do you feel like you’re talking in circles with them? Perhaps most importantly, if they’re not clear on deadlines or deliverables and go with “we’ll figure it out as we go,” I can almost guarantee you’ll regret hiring them.

They treat it like a hobby.

Some freelancers out there are only in it for a little bit of cash on the side. There isn’t anything inherently wrong with that, and yet they may not be the freelancers you want to hire for major projects.

These contractors aren’t all in. They might not have a site or a legitimate invoicing setup. They might not know what 1099s are. They’re disorganized at best or inexperienced at worst. Even if the freelancer has a full-time job that takes up most of their time, that’s still not always what you want because it means you’ll never be their priority or able to reach them during business hours.

If a freelancer isn’t treating their work as a business, they may not be taking it seriously. And if they aren’t taking their work seriously, neither should you.

They don’t have opinions or don’t respect yours.

Opinions are a double-edged sword with freelancers. Ultimately, they’re the expert in their field. They should come with some knowledge that you don’t have. This means that if you pitch something that may not be in your best interest, they should be able to say “I think a good option might be to optimize for X strategy because of Y reason.”

That being said, they should still respect the fact that you’re the client, and you’re the one paying the bills. At the end of the day, what you say goes. If you’re getting major pushback after an initial discussion, there’s a good chance that they’re not the right fit for your project.

Hiring freelancers can be a tricky business, no matter what project you’re working on or the role you’re trying to fill. If you’re stumped trying to find one, ask your network for referrals, and check sites like LinkedIn to search for freelancers with expansive portfolios and a few reviews. You may end up paying more for the right freelancer, and I assure you it’s worth every penny.",
"Feeling overwhelmed by the state of the world? Whether it’s the uncertainty of trade wars between the U.S. and China, the political chaos of Brexit, the violent protests in France or the disturbing consequences of climate change, you might be wondering how to navigate the volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity (VUCA) that defines our age.

VUCA may have become a trendy managerial acronym, but the term was introduced at the U.S. Army War College to describe conditions resulting from the end of the Cold War. Learning to deal with change is not new, as a recent weekend in Rome reminded me, but for the modern manager the pace of change and potential global impact of a locally taken decision requires ever more careful strategic thinking.

How do you best prepare yourself for the uncertainty and complexity of today’s business world? An M.B.A. from one of the world’s top business schools will give you the business fundamentals to drive your career forward in any sector. But a foundation in finance, accounting, ethics, marketing, strategy, economics and operations is now combined with lessons in leadership, communication, entrepreneurial thinking and decision analysis to create value and empower students to embrace change.

So rather than running from the challenge, you might do best by seeking out uncertainty. The worse Brexit gets, the better it will be for those able to identify the resulting opportunities that emerge. The more damaging climate change becomes, the more we will need business leaders whose sustainable thinking benefits not just business, but also society and the environment.

Thirteen of the top fifteen business schools in this year’s Fortuna Ranking of MBA Rankings Europe are located in countries that are faced with societal division, and an uncertain political future. But international demand for their MBA programs has rarely been higher. While wrangling over Brexit is far from over, the future pioneers of FinTech and Renewable Energy are flocking to London Business School and Imperial College Business School to develop skills and tap into unrivaled networks in what remains Europe’s leading financial center.

The Champs Elysées boutiques of Chanel and Louis Vuitton have seen sales plummet as cars burn on the streets of Paris, and the Italian government is in a standoff with Brussels over its budget, but if you want to develop a career in the luxury sector then France’s HEC Paris and ESCP Europe and Italy’s SDA Bocconi and MIP Milano are still the preferred choice for globally minded MBA students.

And though Catalan independence is still at the forefront of tensions in Spain, over 90% the graduates of IESE Business School and Esade Business School in Barcelona had accepted job offers within three months of graduating, with an average alumni salary close to $150,000 three years after graduating.

It’s crazy out there, so investing in yourself is always the best option. And for many, Europe is the place to look for a world-class education with an enviable ROI on a typically shorter M.B.A. Seven of the one-year programs in the biennial Forbes ranking boast a stronger ROI over a five-year period that the likes of Harvard, Stanford and Wharton.

Ahead of the CentreCourt MBA Festival in London on February 9th, which brings together most of the top European business schools to meet with potential applicants, how did the top European Business Schools perform in the Fortuna Ranking of MBA Rankings 2018?

Since 2015, INSEAD has held the #1 spot in an MBA ranking that combines the results relative to other European business schools of the league tables published by the Financial Times, BusinessWeek, The Economist and Forbes. My co-director at Fortuna Admissions, Caroline Diarte Edwards was the former M.B.A. Admissions Director at INSEAD, and shares her own analysis of why INSEAD has performed so strongly in rankings in recent years.

But this year the school with campuses in France and Singapore shares the top spot with Spain’s IESE Business School. It is the first time since the Fortuna Ranking of MBA Rankings began in 2011 that IESE has reached #1, after many years in the top 3 or 4. The school, founded in Barcelona in 1958 formed an alliance with the Harvard Business School in 1963 and launched the first two-year MBA program in Europe. Notable alumni of a school that places corporate social responsibility (CSR) at the heart of its programs include the CEO Calvin Klein, CFO of IKEA and the European MD of Airbnb.

The other big winner this year is Switzerland’s IMD, whose M.B.A. program continues a strong recovery from three years in rankings purgatory to come in at #4 on the Ranking of M.B.A. Rankings. Building on the top ranking in Forbes last year, the school on the shores of Lake Geneva was the highest ranked European school in the first global M.B.A. ranking published yesterday by BusinessWeek. Competition for one of the 90 places in the M.B.A. program has risen sharply, with applications up 63% in the last year.

The biggest loser in 2018 is Madrid’s IE Business School, which fell five places to #11. By consolidating the results of the four major international rankings the Fortuna Ranking of MBA Rankings typically removes the sort of volatility and wild swings up and down that are inherent in any single league table. IE was excluded from the FT ranking in 2018 after many years among the top 5 European Business Schools, and has since struggled in BusinessWeek and The Economist. But don’t expect the school to languish beyond the top 10 for long – a culture of innovative thinking, a world class faculty and an entrepreneurially minded focus on the humanities will soon see the school bounce back.

Below are the results for this year's top five. You can find the full results of the Fortuna Ranking of MBA Rankings 2018 – Europe here, featuring schools who appeared in at least three of the four major M.B.A. rankings in the past 12 months.",None
"Many years ago, I was interviewed about a productivity hack that allowed more people to reclaim their time and use it freely.

Today, I’ll expand upon that idea. I’m going to talk about how you can get more done in a day by doing something that just doesn’t make any sense (but 100% works).

Let’s start by talking about how busy you are now.

As time goes on, would you say you have more tasks to complete in a day, or less? Probably more. And as time goes on, do you think you have more energy to complete those tasks, or less? I’m guessing less.

You’re basically getting busier each day but have less energy, as time goes on. So how is it that some people seem to squeeze a lot more out of their day, when others just can't seem to get much done as quickly?

What are they doing differently to you? Believe it or not, they are actually working less.

Working Less Can Increase Your Productivity

So, you’re getting busier and have less energy. More demands are coming your way. How do you compensate? By working harder and longer than you ever have before.

This is a brute-force method that is natural to us as humans. It makes sense. We’re pushed upon, so surely, we must push back?

You come to this conclusion because you’re measuring total work done. Of course, if you work harder for longer periods of time, your total work done, will increase. The problem is that it’s not sustainable, especially when your energy will naturally reduce over time.

This is how people get stressed and sick.

You need to focus on a new metric – work done per hour. You also need a smart way of working that lets you put this into a system and then maximise your work done per hour.

The foundation of doing this is to remove a major piece of the problem: multi-tasking.

Research done by the Institute of Psychiatry (University of London) studied 1,100 workers. They found that multi-tasking caused a greater decrease in IQ than smoking pot.

Our brains are not made for multi-tasking. As a demo, ask someone to walk fast in a straight line and count backwards from 200 in 7’s (so 200, 193, 186, 179, 172 etc). You will see that their walking will slow down as they work out the numbers in the sequence.

Here, the multi-tasking is causing a physical slowdown that you can visually see. The mind just wasn’t built to process multiple tasks at once.

When you multi-task and do two things together, your brain is “context switching.”

Here’s what the process looks like when we multi-task:

Do you see how confusing and full of friction that process is? This is called a context switch. It’s like driving down the street and pressing the brake every 10 seconds.

It’s inefficient and it burns you out. And just like a car, your brain slows down when you give it multiple start-stop commands at once.

When you’re multi-tasking with your mind, you’re in something called a ‘mixed mode’.

Unbelievably, many people live their entire lives in a mixed mode. They’re not completely focused on work, but they’re not completely switched off, either.

This can slow you down. It can burn you out and, just like the car example, it will suck up all of your energy. Then you’ll wonder why you’re so tired all the time.

Could this be you? Are you stuck in the mixed mode without even knowing it?

Here’s three clues that might help:

The worst part is, when you deplete yourself of strength and will by working like this, you leave your body open to needing pick-me-ups, in the form of nourishment.

This leads to craving and eating sugary drinks and snacks, which is why many office workers’ diets in particular, are often very poor.

It’s the ultimate negative double-whammy. Your output and productivity takes a hit and you’re also more prone to put on weight by working like this.

As living organisms, we have natural work and rest cycles built into our bodies.

Known as Circadian rhythms, they allow us to anticipate and prepare for precise and regular environmental changes. This helps us to make the best use of environmental resources like light and food.

If you compare that to those that can’t predict such availability of natural resources, our work and rest cycles give us a selective advantage in terms of evolution. It makes sense that we listen to them.

For example, if we lift weights without breaks, we will damage our muscles and be in lots of pain too. But if we never use our muscles, they will get weaker.

The solution is to work out and cause a little stress to our muscles. Then we need a period of rest where the body recuperates and makes itself stronger.

Just like we work at a gym in cycles, we also need to work in a similar way with our minds. If you work continuously without breaks, you will burn out — mentally and physically. But if you don’t do much work at all, your performance will be affected negatively.

So, to maximize your work output, try locking your work into ninety-minute chunks of ‘focus mode’. Then follow that up with thirty-minute breaks, called the ‘stop mode’.

Try and get your first ‘focus mode’ completed as early as you can. Getting that ninety minutes of focused (and uninterrupted) work done first thing in your day, will give you a substantial result for your efforts with just one session.

That’ll be satisfying and addictive so it’ll encourage you to do more of it.

Then it’s time for your first ‘stop mode’ block. That’s the thirty-minute period where you should completely disconnect from work.

The idea with the ‘stop mode’ is to switch gears and be in a different mode completely. Get away from your desk. Try not to think about work. Unplug completely and unwind.

Pay attention to the invisible tensions in your body and focus on stretching and relaxing these areas. Try and get your blood moving with a brisk walk even. When it’s time to get back into work, you should feel recharged.

Run the ‘focus mode’ session four times in a day. That’ll give you six solid hours of productive work. That’s actually better for you than working eight straight hours. It’s also definitely better than eight straight hours of working in the unproductive ‘mixed mode’.

You will also feel benefits in your thinking, which will seem clearer because you’re able to focus. You’ll have more energy because you’re not wasting thinking power in the mixed mode any more. You’ll also notice that you get more work done in less time too.

Coming in Jan 2019: As promised, I’ll deconstruct a real-life sales domino as a case study (it’s one of the world’s biggest smartphone manufacturers).

We’ll explore some of the potential fixes in that sales domino, that can turn a tiny no into a big yes. I’ll also reveal how this company is currently potentially losing out on millions of dollars a year in extra sales, due to potential friction in their sales domino.

1 Cruel & Belief-Shaking Twist That Most Business Owners Never Learn

How To Build A Multimillion Dollar Business Based On One Simple Rule Of Bridges",
"When non-entrepreneurs are  asked to describe an entrepreneur in a word or two what comes to mind?

Maybe. But if you asked the entrepreneurs themselves, the words might be different.

Not long ago, I attended the Inc. 5000 conference in San Antonio and got to meet with 150 of America's fastest-growing entrepreneurs--an impressive bunch. But despite their collective successes, many were uneasy with their place in the business world and were still not convinced they would prevail.

One thing I heard often was how many attendees didn't feel alone at the conference because they realized they had similar experiences to everyone else.  Although it was a temporary gathering, a sense of community developed rapidly.

While that bonding experience was helpful to the entrepreneurs, two days of it isn't enough.

That's why I recommend that entrepreneurs should get together on a regular basis--find a local peer group, whether it's Vistage, EO (Entrepreneurs Organization), or YPO as examples.

Aside from the social aspect--all work, no play makes Jack a dull boy--you'll discover you're not alone. Those seemingly incurable problems driving you crazy? You'll be relieved to learn that they likely have happened to plenty of other people - who may be able to offer a solution.

If your business is closely held, your management team probably view things from the same perspective, which can limit objectivity and produce blind spots. Sometimes a fresh perspective is all you need to overcome a roadblock. At the very least, you can use a peer group as a sounding board to test your ideas.

While you'll be able to learn from success, it will be almost as important to learn from failure. Finding what doesn't work can save a lot of time, money and headaches. There's certainly no shame in failing, but if you can avoid some potential problems in advance, more power to you.

Peer groups can also be a wealth of resources that provide much-needed help. They will most likely give you access to a much wider network of information, sources and expertise.

There's even the chance to pool expenses. Say you'd like to conduct some training for your staff, but the cost is prohibitive for your small company. By joining with several companies that need similar training, the shared cost can make the program more affordable.

Don't overlook the importance of being around like-minded, positive-thinking people. I know all too well that running a business sometimes can be a real slog. Your fellow entrepreneurs can provide the encouragement we all sometimes need and you may learn some good working habits--not to mention rising aspirations.

At a minimum, peer groups give you the chance to step away, even briefly, from the day-to-day grind of running your business. Even if you gain nothing from joining a group, stepping back (even for a couple hours) may be beneficial.",
"If you've been reading this website, or paying attention to your own energy level, you already know that going without sleep is very bad for you. It can make you gain weight. It can increase your risk of Alzheimer's. And it can shorten your life.

But if all that isn't enough to convince you that getting enough sleep is really, really important, then consider this: Being sleep deprived makes you suck at your job. In a recent post on the Psychology Today website, clinical psychologist and sleep expert Michael J. Breus, Ph.D., explains all the ways not getting enough sleep messes with your cognitive functioning. Some of them are things you might not expect to result from lack of sleep.

You can read the full post and learn about the science of sleep deprivation here. Here are three of the most surprising ways lack of sleep interferes with your performance:

1. It messes up your memory.

You probably already know that sleep deprivation makes it harder for you to focus. But it also makes it hard for you to remember stuff. Your memory in the sense that you can't remember things you know or things that happened in the past, whether yesterday or ten years ago, Breus explains. But missing sleep also affects your ability to make new memories--that is, to be able to recall later things that are happening right now. If you go into a meeting sleep deprived, there's a better chance that by tomorrow you won't remember what was said or which tasks were assigned to you.

As you may know, during a full night's sleep we cycle through the different stages of sleep several times. It turns out that several of those stages are needed for memory consolidation, including deep sleep, which takes a while to reach. Skip sleep and your ability to remember things will suffer. People who don't know what's going on may simply thing you're not as smart as you really are.

2. It stops you from making smart decisions.

In business, as in life, we constantly have to make decisions where we weigh risk against reward. Is it smarter to take the safe and predictable route or risk disaster in pursuit of something more? While starting a business is an inherently risky thing to do, once they've made that leap, most good entrepreneurs are wisely cautious about, say, burning through their funds too quickly.

But sleep deprivation changes that dynamic. In a fascinating experiment, two groups of people were asked to choose each day between receiving a set sum of money or taking a riskier option in which they would either receive more money or none at all. The experiment ran for five weeks, during which one group slept eight ours a night and the other group five hours a night. As the weeks wore on, the sleep-deprived subjects were more and more likely to choose the risky option. But they themselves could not perceive that their decision-making was changing. Clearly, making decisions while sleep deprived could be very hazardous to your company.

3. It makes you less innovative.

As Breus notes, we all experience moments when great ideas come to us just as we're falling asleep. That might lead you to think being sleepy is good for your creativity but the opposite is actually true. REM sleep--i.e. dreaming--is extremely important for creativity and inspiration. We cycle in and out of REM sleep throughout the night, but the longer we sleep, the more we dream, and our most intense period of dreaming is in the last couple of hours of a good night's sleep. This is why we so often are dreaming right before we wake up in the morning.

Getting enough sleep is important for your health, but if that's not enough to convince you, then consider how important it is for your company as well. There's no point dragging your yawning self to work if you're going to do your job badly. So if you're short of sleep, it might be smarter to give up for the day, go home, and get into bed.",
"Earning customer loyalty may be trickier than ever. After all, 61 percent of U.S. consumers report that they changed brands or providers in the last year, meaning your customers aren’t afraid to leave you.

Customer loyalty also isn’t what some brands believe it to be. For example, customers who always buy the products a brand has on sale aren’t loyal. Many are simply looking for the cheapest option, which means they’re more loyal to the discount than to the brand.

But customers are willing to pay more if it enables them to get better customer service, enjoy a more satisfying experience, or support a particular company’s mission or values. Don’t rely on gimmicks and discounts to build customer loyalty. Instead, you need to understand who your customers are and why they choose one brand over another. If it's not price, what about your brand or product would appeal most to them?

Once you figure out who they are and what they want, you’ll unlock the doors to truly cultivating loyal customers. For instance, if you learn that friendly and helpful customer service is the most important thing on their list when choosing a brand, then tout your customer-friendly policies and positive reviews from other customers about their experiences.

The point is that you’ll never earn customers’ loyalty until you know what they value; without their loyalty, you’re losing a precious resource. Returning customers spend more than new customers, which means you can earn more for every first-time customer whose loyalty you successfully cultivate.

As you look to update your customer-centric strategies, it’s just as important to keep a to-don’t list as it is to have a to-do list. To foster lasting customer loyalty, avoid making the following missteps:

While you should absolutely use data to determine who your customers are and what they’re interested in, that doesn’t mean you should change your entire image or direction just to conform to what you find. Instead, identify the areas where your product, service, or brand relates most to different segments of your audience, then emphasize those areas as much as possible in your marketing efforts. The goal is to highlight things about your product, service, or company that resonate with what matters most to your customers.

Digital marketing agency Bradley and Montgomery calls this philosophy share of culture, and the company’s marketing strategies home in on its audience’s culture in an attempt to create and strengthen relationships with its customers. You can do this, too, and act on what you learn. For instance, if your customers value social consciousness, then highlight your brand’s involvement in the community and contributions to charity.

2. Don’t assume what was true yesterday is true today.

One fact that your customer data will always show is that preferences, priorities, and emotions change, sometimes from month to month. You can learn what used to matter to your customers last year, but don’t assume that it will be the same this year — or the next. Instead, avoid making assumptions and base decisions on current customer data and feedback.

Forecasting the future will require analyzing more than just past purchasing data. See what customers are following on social media, stay engaged in trending conversations, and keep track of new technologies that change how customers search and shop. Constant engagement is the only way to spot which direction customers will likely head next. And keep your forecasts focused on the short term because a lot can change quickly.

While getting to know your customers better, you’ll have to encourage and facilitate feedback about their experience. In the process, don’t forget to bring your employees in on the conversation. They’re on the front lines, so they see customers going through those experiences, which makes them privy to the most common issues customers face. Employees also have an inside track on how customers really feel about your company and brand.

Because your team members have both context about the company and interact directly with customers on a daily basis, they can provide valuable insights about how to improve the customer experience. Also, employees who know their voices matter are more satisfied and more likely to interact positively with customers — so asking for their perspective is a win all around.

Building a loyal customer base is challenging, but the path to success is no secret. Today’s customers aren’t hard to understand — they simply want to do business with companies and brands that care about what they care about. Use data to learn who they are and build your marketing strategy to resonate with them, and keep these three to-don’ts in mind if you want that connection to mean something — and to last.",
"Are you finally feeling good about diversity and inclusion at your company? Maybe you’ve done the hard work of building a diverse workforce and have begun to increase inclusivity by establishing a vision, values and practices focused on equity.

Congratulations — you’re on the right track to a better culture and better business results. But you aren’t done.

Even with the best intentions, there are ways your diversity and inclusion momentum can be lost and possibly reversed. Based on my experience as a business leader and internal coach working with large multinational companies for two decades, I’ve seen three potential derailers to successful diversity and inclusion.

I’ll share them and their impact below. And I’ll give you rerailers — tips to get back on course toward a truly equitable organization.

These are the people who manage access to you. This includes which people and what information can reach you. They support you by managing the flow of information, ensuring that you're included in the most critical meetings and helping to keep you on message. But these handlers can sometimes go overboard in their attempts to block all the noise from reaching you.

You may rely on their secondhand accounts and erroneously feel that all the pieces are in place for an inclusive culture. While these handlers may be well-intentioned, they could be inadvertently setting you up to be blindsided by one of the brave souls who will dare to tell you the truth about the real sentiments echoing across the organization.

Beware of your handlers. They can keep the truth from ever getting to you. You may not be seeing the key perspectives needed to inform your words and actions relative to the corporate culture. Your handlers also may treat challenging feedback from employees as a threat instead of an opportunity to become curious.

Rerailer: Take listening into your own hands. Engage in meaningful inquiry with your employees — in various venues and at all levels. This may range from informal meetings to formal business reviews. Just check in to see what they feel needs to stop, start or continue relative to diversity and inclusion in the organization.

It’s also important to coach your handlers to help them understand the need for opportunities to engage without heavy choreography. One example is taking some questions in the moment instead of always relying on a predetermined and carefully screened lot.

Middle managers often say they're onboard with diversity and inclusion. But in my experience, many in the ranks of middle management don't always proactively build inclusive cultures. They may give superficial nods of approval to senior leadership but remain frozen in their beliefs and behaviors.

Middle managers can play a crucial role in translating corporate priorities into practice for employees on the front lines. If they're only paying lip service to diversity, then they can undermine your efforts to attract, retain and develop a diverse and inclusive workforce.

Many of these managers may be well-meaning. Their lack of commitment to diversity and inclusion may stem from habits dating back decades or to their own struggles to do more with less. After all, according to research by Gallup, just 35% of U.S. managers are engaged in their jobs. This sobering reality highlights the importance of helping your middle managers warm to the idea of diversity and inclusion as a strategic imperative. Otherwise, your inclusion efforts could slip off course.

Rerailer: Melt middle management resistance with data. Conduct routine 360-degree feedback surveys for all leaders and include questions specifically focused on inclusion and diversity. The assessment itself and the resulting information should spark greater self-awareness, commitment and accountability for managers.

I’m talking here about leaders who are responsible for enabling employees to share confidential concerns related to inclusion, bias and harassment. Safe spaces can be undermined if they're not managed by the right gatekeepers.

I’ve seen some of the best-designed diversity and inclusion plans be treated with skepticism by employees who've been burned by untrustworthy gatekeepers. Such leaders should not hold positions where high levels of discretion and confidentiality are needed. Loose lips can sink more than ships if they're attached to the people who are supposed to be the guardians of secrets.

Do a gut check for real versus perceived trustworthiness of the people in positions to facilitate tough conversations. If this isn't happening, as an executive leader, you could be perceived as aloof — or worse yet, clueless — because you think everything is fine while, in reality, people aren’t engaging in meaningful discussions because they don’t trust the gatekeepers.

Rerailer: Increase accountability for gatekeepers. Survey and directly ask employees whether they feel they have a safe space to voice concerns. Ask whether the reporting structure is trustworthy. And don’t shy away from the tough questions, such as ""Is there a fear of retaliation?” This way, you’ll hold your gatekeepers accountable and learn for yourself whether honest feedback is flowing. A universal best practice is to create a separate, third-party avenue for anonymously reporting concerns.

The bad news about derailers is that they can often go undetected by the top echelon of leaders in an organization. This means that diversity and inclusion shouldn't be delegated to just one person, department or survey. Leaders must have firsthand knowledge of what's really happening in their organizations. This includes inquiring about and understanding the experience of non-majority employees.

The good news is that knowing about these derailers and rerailers can help prepare you for the future. As demographics continue to shift toward greater diversity, leading-edge companies are developing new protocols and practices that reflect a forward-looking sensibility when it comes to inclusion.

Lean into your curiosity, and learn for yourself exactly what you're asking people to be included in when they join your organization. You can be one of the leaders who help shape the future of work, inclusive cultures and business success.",
"Many companies teeter regarding offering internships. Much of this uncertainty arises because organizations are skeptical about whether it’s a good use of time and money. By approaching the idea of an internship program with the intent of using it as part of a succession-planning process and as a training ground for new hires, I believe companies will find that it can be a key component of the recruitment process.

At my company, it's important to us that our employees fit and understand our culture -- and that goes for our interns, too. We feel that the future of any company is weighted heavily on the people that work there, and our team looks to promote within our organization for the best results. A well-developed internship program can help jumpstart that promotion process.

I established my commercial construction firm in 1995. Currently, we have more than 100 employees. But it didn't start out that way. We grew our team carefully and strategically through a very selective interview process. In doing so, we have ensured everyone on our team fits the mold of our core beliefs as a company.

And not only are our employees carefully selected, but our interns are, too. Every summer, my company hires a number of college interns that work amongst our project managers and superintendents to learn more about the industry. I've found that the success of an internship program depends on the talent you recruit, which is why we don’t take our hiring process lightly. If you’re looking to hire college interns at your company, I recommend looking for individuals that:

• Go above and beyond what is required

• Are willing to learn the technical skills of the job

• Fit the mold of the company

Going Above And Beyond

In any industry, it’s important to identify those who go above and beyond what is required. It shows dedication to the job and a willingness to work. This could mean taking the initiative to learn the technical skills needed for a job. When an intern takes the step to educate himself or herself in the daily skills needed, it not only helps them in the long run but can also help the company.

This can be assessed in a number of ways from the employer’s perspective. Before the interview, the employer needs to have a solid understanding of the parameters of the job and what competencies are necessary. Once those are determined, the employer can task the intern with specific tasks to accomplish. You can tailor specific questions to the individual intern to discover if they possess those various skills or not. The key concept is knowing how to listen to what the intern is saying and asking follow-up questions when necessary.

It’s important that an intern feels a fit with your company and seeks to build relationships with clients and co-workers. The willingness to communicate and get to know your co-workers can ultimately help make them part of your second family.

Employers can assess this fit and the intern's willingness during the interview process. You can utilize assessments to learn more about the potential intern or ask behavioral questions that the intern can answer with examples. Some questions you could ask include:

• Can you please provide an example of a team that you have participated on and what your role was?

• Have you ever been part of a team that did not succeed in meeting a goal? If so, why didn't it succeed, and what did you do to improve the outcome?

• What role do you usually have when you’re on a team?

Creating this selective interview process and utilizing a structured internship program has helped our company see considerable results.

We have found that setting requirements for our interns has not only shown success on our end but on the student’s end as well. We also have college interns spend the summer receiving on-the-job training and mentorship under experienced professionals, which allows them to get the most out of the experience. Typically, I've found that these students continue to work in the field for several years down the road and build on the challenges and tricks of the trade.

Pairing an intern with a mentor can allow them to focus on reaching a goal rather than being rotated around various departments with no ultimate outcome. As a result, the intern is treated more as an employee, which can drive determined students to put the pedal to the metal and run projects of their own to prove their impact for a company.

In our program, we pair students with our construction industry professionals. If a student wants to become a project manager, you can partner them with someone in a similar position, such as a superintendent or project manager, to shadow daily. In addition to attending weekly meetings and working directly with that contact, these interactions can provide the intern with a real-world view. Once they leave the company, they can return to their educational institution and apply that knowledge successfully. I have found that it helps clear up a lot of misconceptions about how things should get done, and the interns are better prepared if they return to work with us.

While creating a successful internship program may take time, the outcome is often well worth it. Not only can the younger generation gain real-world experience and knowledge, but your organization could also discover that you are creating a successful career path for future employees.",
"If you’re on the board or management team of a traditional financial or insurance institution, chances are you’re already in the early planning stages to partner up with a RegTech provider.

After all, hiring an entire tech team to take on the challenges of navigating constant regulation changes and jumping over compliance hoops is not an efficient or cost-effective solution.

Before you can truly integrate or adopt RegTech into your existing setup, we’ve narrowed down some steps to follow to make the adoption process go much more smoothly.

RegTech is short for “regulatory technology” and was coined almost four years ago in the U.K.

Since then, it’s sprung new technologies that help banks, financial institutions and government agencies meet regulatory demands for reporting, monitoring and managing compliance risks, all while saving those entities time and money.

In recent years, we’ve especially seen a growing number of traditional companies employ RegTech solutions to integrate with and transform their businesses, in lieu of upending their legacy systems or intaking more IT team members to work through internal compliance challenges.

At its true essence, RegTech aims to solve for the “three C’s,” which are compliance, cost and complexity.

Adoption of a RegTech solution can and must be a well-managed and carefully thought out process.

Follow these steps to make it a success:

Define fit-for-purpose use cases that demonstrate a strong return on investment (ROI) to help drive and convince others of your business decisions.

Map out the immediate benefits that RegTech solutions can offer. Take, for instance, anti-money-laundering (AML) solutions that have delivered the following benefits:

• Created a more accurate and efficient reporting and audit trail

Evaluate whether your existing systems can integrate seamlessly with APIs and anywhere due diligence or know your customer (KYC) information is stored -- for example, in your CRM software such as Salesforce.

• Plot out your requirements, what rules you want to implement and what data you want to see before meeting with the implementation engineer; this will make for a faster and more seamless onboarding process.

• If your existing systems aren’t entirely ready for integration, move to an open architecture that facilitates an easier introduction of RegTech into the organization.

• Consider the use of a trial phase or test environment known as a QA environment or sandbox. Such programs can help you decide if the solution is a good fit; you might find it can help accelerate innovation and get new products to market quicker.

When implementing a flexible and reliable RegTech solution, it’s best to have individuals around who possess significant compliance and risk expertise as well as a deep understanding of technology.

• Nominate or assign an account or project manager that understands your company’s full compliance needs and knows the language of your business.

• Install an implementation engineer who can speak to your technology team and who knows the ins and outs of integration.

• If your RegTech solution impacts any customer-facing components of your business, then train and prepare your client service individuals with the right terminology, use cases and experiences so they are accessible, adept and responsive to what’s ahead.

4. Know Your Business And Your Clients

Every business is different; suspicious activity at one place can be considered business as usual at another.

• Ensure your RegTech tools are configured to suit your business and tailored to your clients and customer profile.

• Set your system up to provide comprehensive management information and be dynamic enough to adapt when requirements or risk appetites change.

• Train your in-house staff sufficiently so even non-IT or technical persons are able to recognize and complete these tasks.

5. Get Everyone On The Same Page

Regulatory software can result in an ROI of 600% (or more) with a payback period of under three years. But you’ve got to invest time and resources upfront to benefit from such gains.

• The scope of work, time frame and exit strategy for the proof of concept (POC) with RegTech companies should be agreed upon upfront.

• Consider streamlining the POC approval process and creating a “fast track” procurement process for RegTech companies.

By following these recommended steps, this little bit of upfront planning to prepare for your RegTech adoption may result in outcomes that will go a long way, exceed expectations and deliver stellar results.",None
"One person in the news who strikes me as a natural leader is former first lady Michelle Obama. And a recent article in the Washington Post highlights an important reason why -- she comes across to others as genuine, rather than scripted. People can relate to Obama because she's authentic.

That quality came across in a speech she gave on December 1 in which she expressed what struck me as an honest opinion about leaning in -- an idea promoted by Facebook chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg.

As the Post wrote, ""Consider the s-bomb --[according to NPR, Obama said ""That lean-in s#$% doesn't always work!""] -- dropped in an arena of 19,000 (when she denounced Sheryl Sandberg's ""lean in"" philosophy).""

As Harvard Business School professor, Bill George, wrote in the Harvard Business Review, authentic leadership can be developed because it's based on improving your emotional quotient (EQ) -- as opposed to your IQ which is more difficult to raise.

In interviewing 172 authentic leaders, George found that learning more about themselves had increased their authenticity as leaders. Here are four steps to make yourself more self-aware so you can attain some of the authenticity that Obama exhibits so well.

1. Explore your life story and the challenges you've overcome

If you've overcome challenges in life and thought about how you did it, you'll get a deeper understanding of who you are. And that will give you more confidence in your ability to respond effectively in difficult situations.

I've had challenges in my life -- some of which I share with my students. For example, after not being happy working in a large corporation, I decided in the middle of a recession to start my own business -- with pressure to support my wife and two young children in the process.

As I look back on it, starting a company and making it successful proved to be far easier than I had anticipated. But thinking about why corporate life was less satisfying and what do to about it made me more confident that I could overcome startup challenges.

2. Take time to reflect on every day

Aspiring authentic leaders should turn off their iPhones and disconnect from the seemingly endless stream of urgent demands on their time. Practice meditation, mindfulness, prayer, long walks to clear your mind, or simply sit quietly and reflect, said George.

Taking a long run in the middle of the day does it for me. And it's a very helpful way to figure out what problems are important and how to solve them.

Don't surround yourself with people who praise your every move. Instead, seek out honest feedback -- delivered respectfully -- from colleagues, friends, and subordinates about you and your leadership.

To be an authentic leader, you need to understand -- and try to minimize -- the gap between how you see yourself and how others do. One way to do that is to gather feedback through regular 360 degree reviews from peers and subordinates. Take the comments you get from these reviews and genuinely try to change.",
"is the cornerstone of business success, and it's all due to the powerful effects of  . As team members bounce ideas off each other, diverse perspectives combine to catalyze creative solutions to business problems.

One of the biggest hindrances to effective teamwork was highlighted in the most recent edition of Gallup's   report. Researchers asked survey respondents whether their ""associates or fellow employees are committed to doing quality work.""

Only 3 out of 10 respondents strongly agreed with the statement. However, doubling that number could reduce turnover by 29 percent and boost profits by 11 percent, according to Gallup. The survey shows that there are huge engagement and productivity benefits to making sure your team members function well together, respect each other, and believe that everyone is doing their best work.

How can managers work toward this utopian vision of togetherness and camaraderie? Team cohesion starts at the top: Leaders should be democratic and include employees in decision-making efforts. When leaders don't engage, they alienate employees and weaken team spirit.

Team motivation also demands healthy conflict management. Without it, morale can sag, and distrust can grow. Creating a team in which diversity is clearly valued and conflicts are resolved respectfully can go a long way toward enhancing harmony.

Recruit team players who will support the team through its inevitable ups and downs. Interviewers should look for traits that are most associated with fostering team spirit--and not just friendliness and excitement. Dustin White, CEO and founder of Made Brand Management, a direct-to-consumer brand investment company, recommends hiring candidates who exhibit motivation, humility, and resilience.

For example, you might ask recruits what gets them out of bed in the morning or how they cope with mistakes. ""It's essential to have team members you can depend on and be transparent with,""   White. ""These individuals keep you grounded and help you avoid wasting time on negativity. When so many obstacles can come between your business and success, make sure one of them isn't who makes up your team.""

Cross-functional teams are an effective way to enhance your operations and spur innovation, but it's important to make sure that everyone is working toward the same overall goal and level of quality. Teams whose members are inadvertently undermining each other's progress can be a big drag on efficiency. Plus, it's impossible to collaborate with misaligned key performance indicator--no small matter, considering just  of cross-functional teams see clear objectives from leadership, according to PwC.

Big companies like Apple, IKEA, and Lego look at ways to avoid these sorts of misalignments. For example, they've made some of their cross-functional teams permanent, rather than project-based, entities. Some organizations are converting R&D divisions into cross-functional groups led by chief innovation officers. However you do it, it's crucial that these patchwork teams recognize wins together by working toward common goals.

Teamwork is about collaboration, and that means each individual has to pull his or her own weight. Every team member must meet expected benchmarks in order for a group effort to succeed.

To maintain standards of accountability, start by outlining the expected goals for each role. It's also vital to keep communication channels open. Offer a safe forum--a weekly team meeting, perhaps--for sharing concerns about a project, including what's going off track, confusion about the objective, or even imbalances in team members' contributions.

Teamwork won't work without a little assistance: It often needs to be helped along by careful and responsive management. By recruiting team-oriented employees, standardizing goals across cross-functional teams, and encouraging accountability, you'll have everyone doing their best work--and doing it together.",communication
"I injured my ankle a few years ago and the physician said, ""I think it's broken but it's so swollen we can't see the break on the x-rays."" She sent me home with crutches and said to return in a few days when the swelling went down so we could take another set of x-rays.

Even though my ankle was wrapped tightly in an ace bandage, the thought of moving around with a broken bone made me shudder. So I moved my leg as little as possible out of fear that one wrong twist would damage my ankle even more.

I waited a few days but the swelling didn't go down. My doctor sent me to see a physical therapist. By then, almost a week had passed and my ankle was getting worse.

After taking a quick look at my ankle, the physical therapist said, ""It's not broken. It's just a bad sprain."" He explained how he knew it wasn't broken and said, ""It's still swollen because you haven't moved your ankle joint in a week. Any joint that stays stiff that long is going to be angry. Start moving it and the swelling will subside and you'll feel better.""

He was right. I started doing the exercises he recommended and within two days, I could walk without crutches. My ankle wasn't broken. It was my belief that it was broken that was holding me back.

Ironically, this is exactly the type of self-limiting belief I teach people in my therapy office to avoid--believing they're more fragile or more wounded than they actually are.

It's easy to do that to yourself. Believing you're too fragile to cope with emotional pain--or thinking you're too weak to recover from an emotional wound--will cause you to become protective of yourself. Over time, you'll grow so busy defending against anything that might hurt you that you won't be able to build a life that matters.

The more you protect yourself from emotional discomfort--like feeling sad, hurt, or disappointed--the fewer opportunities you'll have to put your mental muscles to use. And over time, those muscles atrophy similar to the way your physical muscles would atrophy if you never used them.

Unfortunately, living deep inside your comfort zone won't create a comfortable life. In fact, your efforts will backfire. Rather than put your energy into overcoming challenges and solving problems, all of your effort will be devoted to your fear that you're unable to cope.

How to See Yourself As Strong

It's important to care for emotional wounds (just like you need to care for yourself physical wounds). But too often, we confuse being overprotective with self-care. Sometimes, the best thing you can do for yourself is push through the discomfort--not avoid it.",None

"During the big influx of refugees to Germany, several outdoor brands moved positively to provide jobs, aligning with the German entrepreneurial initiative ‘Bleibrecht durch Arbeit’ which aims to provide refugees with a permanent job with a secure right of residence. It involves 120 businesses with a combined annual turnover of more than €50 billion. Together they engage in non-partisan work for refugees and work for a change in the legal framework.

Antje von Dewitz, Managing Director of Vaude Sport, said,""We want to make our contribution to integration and counteract the social divide in Germany. Integration works best over work, that's what our experiences show. At the same time, we urgently need workers in many areas in order to maintain our economic power and enable further growth.”

For Vaude, this meant overcoming the concerns of some of their existing workers, teaching refugees German and finding accommodation amongst a raft of positive actions. At the recent European Outdoor Summit (EOS)  in Malmö, Sweden, the situation of refugees in Europe was raised. Mark Held, Secretary General of the European Outdoor Group (EOG), addressed delegates on the subject and asked them if they would support the EOG developing a position on the subject.

Held said, “Now the political climate towards refugees in Germany has changed and many (outdoor brands) have workers the state is now saying cannot remain. The brands have fought against this and Vaude were invited to take part in a panel discussion on national TV to explain why they are protesting. The result was, in some ways, sadly predictable and they were bombarded by hate mail and threats. So, after a lengthy discussion, I addressed the attendees at the EOS. When I asked those who agreed to stand up, the response was virtually unanimous.”

Statement on behalf of all members of the European Outdoor Group:

‘At present we appear to be witnessing a change in the social and political landscapes of Europe and this is causing us great concern. Extremist voices are spreading distrust and discrimination and we are all too aware of where this has led Europe in the past.

The principles of equality and non-discrimination are laid down in the United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights: “All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights” (Article 1). This was further strengthened by the European Convention on Human Rights and specifically, Article 14 and Protocol 12.

The outdoor sector, as represented by the European Outdoor Group, supports these declarations and states clearly that:

We absolutely reject all extremist tendencies of whatever kind and will not tolerate them within our companies. Humanity, diversity, tolerance and mutual respect are part of the DNA of outdoor companies and at present, these values are being questioned by a vociferous minority. This is something that we oppose, and we believe in a society that is open, diverse and democratic. Relying on a silent majority to uphold those values is not enough and this is why we have chosen to set out our position in this statement.'

Whilst integration represents challenges to businesses, von Dewitz has a wider vision, ""Integration is not a walk. As a company, we are not only an employer but also an integration service provider. So we also take care of the language problems and authorities of our refugee employees. But it is nice to see how the company has developed a great cooperation - that gives me the strength to fight for it.”

In an email this morning, Held commented, ‘On a wider note, however, the position the EOG is steadily developing is that of a sector that is values-driven, so whether it be environmental, social, sustainability etc, the outdoor sector should know what it collectively believes in and be true to those beliefs. You’ll see a lot more of this over the coming months.’",
"Your door is open, you encourage people to come to you with any issues and you’ve been a supportive leader. But now? You're the go-between for your team as they complain and whine about other team members, fighting their fights and winning their battles for them. Nothing gets accomplished (although your step counter is up for the day), and you feel exhausted from listening to issues without hearing any solutions.

Stop being the monkey in the middle as their go-between and become a leader who empowers your team through coaching. The above type of three-way relationship is reflective of the ""drama triangle,"" a common phenomenon in workplace relationships that often sees leaders unable to find or create long-lasting and empowering solutions. Rather, this back and forth creates more damage and less engaged employees.

What’s crucial to create empowered individuals is removing the drama from the drama triangle. Yes, it’s that obvious. And this triangular relationship isn’t just between individuals. It's also at play within companies where the drama happens between different departments. Regardless of individual or department, it's possible to move towards a positive outcome once you’ve identified that you’re in the triangle.

Stop And Own Your Role

“I’m just trying to help.”

""They can’t solve it without me.”

If any of these rings a little too true, ask yourself why. Chances are these thoughts are enabling the drama. Recognize what actions you’re taking that contribute to the triangle and how you can start to create a different outcome.

Ask each individual involved what they hope to get out of this situation along with what they could do to get it. By having them find their own solutions rather than you trying to solve them, you support them in finding an outcome they’re comfortable with. Not sure where to start? Ask them to:

• Recognize their part in the scenario

• State what outcome they want

• Identify what they are willing to do to create what they want

Let people know what boundaries you are setting and then stick to them. Examples of what this can look like are:

• ""It’s OK to come and talk to me, but it’s not OK to come and vent without then finding a solution.""

• ""I can coach you on how to approach Peter about this issue, John. However, I will not go and talk to him on your behalf.""

• ""I will be a mediator at your and John’s meeting, but I will not have separate meetings about it afterward.""

• ""Tell me how I can help you help yourself.""

Yes, people may be disappointed in you for not saving them, but know that this is OK. This can be one of the hardest parts of leadership. Ultimately, by not jumping in, safety floaties and all, you’re now supporting them in finding an impactful long-term solution or relationship rather than a short-term Band-Aid. Your role as facilitator is purely to enable people to come together to identify an agreed-upon way forward. This is your opportunity to take on the role of coach and not rescuer.

As you practice coaching rather than rescuing, the following skills will support you in creating engaged critical thinkers:

• Neutrality: You must remain a neutral party at all times, even if you agree with one party.

• Empathy: Demonstrate empathy to allow each individual to feel heard and validated while staying neutral. For example, say, “I’m sorry you’re dealing with this,” not, “I agree, this isn’t right.”

• Active listening: Be engaged in the conversation, even if you’re there as a fly on the wall.

• Open-ended questions: Make the questions you ask open-ended, as this helps to engage people in their critical thinking. For instance, ask each person to tell you what they need rather than having you tell them what they need.

• Self awareness: Notice, as a leader, when you play the role of victim and how you model this behavior to others. This will help you discover how to coach yourself in owning your part and recognizing what your options forward are. The best way to minimize the power of the drama triangle is to model the behavior you want reflected. Want a team of critical thinkers who are empowered to work through their issues in a respectful manner? Then you need to start reflecting this by no longer being the rescuer of your team, but the leader who coaches them to find their own solutions.

The truth is that any time there are more than two people, there will always be potential for a drama triangle. The good news? You have the power to remove the drama simply by owning your part, then helping others own theirs to move forward. This is your power as a leader.",
"Emotional intelligence is often one of the greatest predictors of leadership success, especially at the executive level. It can be a differentiator for leaders on the rise. Research confirms that emotional intelligence and leadership accomplishment at the highest levels are highly correlated. Not everyone is born with it, but you can improve your emotional intelligence with practice. If you’re going to practice something new, the visualization of that behavior certainly helps.

So what exactly does an emotionally intelligent leader look like? In my experience, leaders with high emotional intelligence often display four key attributes that you can easily spot in your day-to-day interactions:

1. They know themselves well. Self-awareness is foundational to high emotional intelligence. When you truly know what makes you tick, what your tendencies are and what motivates you, you can quickly make sense of your emotions. Most importantly, it's this honest understanding and acceptance of what I often call “the good, the bad and the ugly” about yourself that allows you to build strategies to make real progress in mastering the behaviors required to be successful. There’s no defensiveness or excuses. Emotionally intelligent leaders look at themselves in the mirror of feedback and say, “Yes, that’s me.”

2. They are transparent and speak the truth. Emotionally intelligent leaders are authentic leaders who aren’t afraid to let their vulnerabilities be known. They readily acknowledge their flaws and own their mistakes. Likewise, they're able to confront reality and talk straight with others in a manner that lends clarity without game playing or emotional blows. You always know where you stand with an emotionally intelligent leader, and you respect them all the more for it. By allowing their true self to be seen and heard, they give others permission to do the same, which accelerates the building of trust.

3. They connect and are tuned in. The abilities to be perceptive about people and situations, meet others where they are and recognize their needs and emotional responses are hallmarks of emotional intelligence. Emotionally intelligent leaders listen first, allowing others to be heard. They are open-minded, give thoughtful consideration to other ideas and perspectives and are nonjudgmental in their responses. Emotionally intelligent leaders are not only fully present and able to read others well but can adjust their thinking or approach in response to others to produce a more productive outcome.

4. They are composed and collected. Emotionally intelligent leaders rarely get their buttons pushed. It’s here, in the mastery of self-management, that a leader’s awareness of their emotions is critical, as self-awareness is what allows you to actively make a choice about how to respond. Emotionally intelligent leaders don’t allow their emotions to get hijacked because they recognize that this serves to unnecessarily disrupt and frustrate those around them, sometimes to the point of resentment. Rather, they model constancy and maintain control of even the most difficult situations, which gives their teams the stability that can fuel maximum performance.

Take a moment to reflect on these four attributes. Picture in your mind a leader who displays one or more of these attributes day in and day out. They probably make it look effortless, but trust me, they likely didn’t become proficient in their mastery of the behavior overnight. It’s usually only through diligent practice, self-reflection and feedback that leaders can improve their emotional intelligence. Yes, at first it may feel like heavy lifting. But in time, it can become your natural state of leading. It begins with the first step. Pick one attribute at a time, and get to work on your own emotional intelligence improvement plan. Before you know it, you can be that emotionally intelligent leader that others picture in their minds.",
"When we talk about successful people — especially those who sustain and build their success over time — have a very particular, albeit sometimes unexpected, set of traits.

People who are successful later in life are principled, driven, focused and intelligent. But did you also know that they are likely to be sensitive, demanding, and perpetually dissatisfied? Probably not. Here are some of the most important traits that, for better or for worse, tend to predict greater success down the line.

Highly successful people are usually not renaissances. (Research shows that after graduation, those who graduate at the top of their class go on to achieve moderate success, because their skills are broad, whereas radical success requires focused, singular expertise.)

Likewise, highly successful people are typically not the smartest in their class. They aren't seen as geniuses at the onset. Most often, they have a very particular skill, and they are outstandingly, singularly talented at it. When they learn to capitalize on that skill is when they find land their most outstanding achievements.

Highly successful people are very particular. They are not satisfied with ""good enough."" They are the type of people who will dissect everything wrong with anything, and who won't rest until every part of it is exactly as they had envisioned, or better. Though this can wreak havoc in some aspects of their lives if not kept in check, when it comes to business, it's actually an asset to be so relentlessly driven for greatness.

Another odd trait of highly successful people is that they are usually not those who are content with their lives exactly as they are. They are forward-thinking, and constantly imagining what they could create, experience, fix or change next.

It's this kind of perpetual dissatisfaction that actually propels them to continue working on their lives and careers.

Highly successful people expect a lot and ask for a lot, and don't settle for less.

This is true of pretty much anyone who achieves some sort of mastery in their lives: they know what works, and refuse to settle for anything less than exactly what they need to make it work. You hear this all the time — from athletes to musicians to newly minted royals — they are not highly accomplished and extremely put together on accident. It requires focused thought, attention to detail, and high expectations that must be met.

This is one that's very much overlooked but highly successful people are often very sensitive and secretly emotional. They mask this well, but at their core, they have a desire to improve their own lives, or the lives of those around them.

Most highly successful people are like visionaries: they can imagine what the outcome needs to be, even if they have to outsource a team with expertise to create it. In this way, highly successful people are also not islands unto themselves. They do not work independently all the time, or assume they can do everything themselves. In fact, one of their greatest attributes is their willingness to surround themselves with people who are smarter than them.

Not afraid to say ""no.""

Highly successful people know how to say ""yes"" to what they want... but they also know how to say ""no"" to what they don't.

You will never find a highly successful person who gets coffee with someone if they don't want to, or keeps an employee on if it doesn't make sense anymore. Those who are highly accomplished are not people pleasers, though that doesn't mean they are necessarily rude or lacking in empathy. Rather, they know how to calmly and clearly state their needs and boundaries, because ultimately, highly successful people know that their energy is the most precious resource of all, one which they must guard with great caution.",
"I have found that the best lessons in business come from learning from big mistakes. When things go well, you are probably more inclined to celebrate your win than to step back and take the time to try to figure out what could have gone even better. But when things go poorly, you have no choice but to take a cold, hard look at what happened and cull whatever lessons you can from your experience to ensure that you don't make the same mistake twice.

When we launched our cigar company, we thought we had it all figured out, and our confidence was only bolstered by the positive reinforcement we received from those around us. Cigar aficionados were our target customers, and we built our business to cater to the hardcore cigar smokers who would love nothing more than to have their own cigar brand.

But before we could celebrate our success, we were hit with a rude awakening. Our offering didn't resonate with our target audience. We held events for cigar enthusiasts and were received with lukewarm enthusiasm at best. We attended industry trade shows, and our pitch fell on deaf ears. We reached out to cigar publications to try to generate media coverage, but they couldn't have cared less. Most importantly, we weren’t getting orders from hardcore cigar smokers.

We listened to the feedback, though, and understood why: Cigars smokers are extremely brand conscious and brand loyal. They take tremendous pride in smoking their brand of choice. Not only were we not solving a problem for them, but if a problem did exist, we would not be the solution. Yes, we offered great cigars and a novel concept, but at the of the day, our audience didn’t like it.

We were getting orders, but not from the customers we were counting on. We realized that the people ordering from us fell into two general camps: gift-givers and event planners. We observed that the majority of our customers were women who were buying cigars for a male end-user.

We listened to the music and rebranded to appeal to women. We recognized that we were marketing to the wrong audience and corrected course. Rather than focusing on attending more cigar-oriented events, we've gone to event-planning trade shows and have networked with wedding planners and corporate event planners.

What We Learned From Our Mistakes

Selling to the wrong audience took us down a path that ultimately led us to the right audience. It required listening — both to those who liked and did not like our product — and a willingness to change course. While we endured because of our ability to pivot, our initial failing was very avoidable. Like many other entrepreneurs, we did not engage in a truly rigorous customer discovery and market validation process prior to launching our company. We used a very small sample size, mistook the positive reinforcement from friends and others we knew as real market research and drank our own Kool-Aid. We didn't talk to enough strangers and didn't ask enough hard questions. We were too busy building the business to soberly assess whether it was a business worth building.

How To Evaluate Your Business's Viability

Over the years, I have had many business ideas but have only pursued a small percentage. I've learned the importance of asking: Is this business idea worthwhile? Is our team capable of pulling it off? Are we the right people to do it? I have found that the answers to those questions are more often ""no"" than ""yes."" Consider the size of the market you will be entering, how differentiated your product or service will be and whether your team has competitive advantages that will allow them to build and run the business more effectively than others who might pursue the same concept or a similar one. And consider how well the requirements of starting and leading the new venture will align with everyone's skills and interests; make sure that you and your team are not only good at what the business entails but are also passionate about the vision and mission.

When you're convinced that you have the right idea and the right team to pull it off, validate your conviction by speaking to the customers who you believe will buy your product. Find out not just whether they like your idea but whether they'll be willing to pay for what you are selling — and if so, how much. If you have the budget, consider engaging a market research firm that can help you design and conduct surveys, focus groups and other means for gathering the insight you need to make an educated decision. But if you don’t have the budget, do it yourself. Anonymous online surveys can be helpful to an extent, but the real value is often in face-to-face conversation. Identify your target market and find a way to get in front of them, literally. Get into the field, start talking to people and, most importantly, listen. As John Wooden famously said, “It's what you learn after you know it all that counts.”",
"Becoming a YouTuber is now young people’s number one career aspiration. According to a survey, by The Sun, over three quarters of the participants were considering some sort of career in online video. It’s pretty amazing, considering it wasn’t even a career option until recently.

But exactly how professional YouTubers operate remains a mystery to most. How do they make money? Do they do it all by themselves? Do you need to have millions of subscribers to make a living?

I sat down with professional YouTubers, Marissa Rachel and Shanna Lisa, and tried to answer the most common questions.

Myth: YouTubers make all of their money from views.

Truth: Branded content, merch and licensing deals are all far more lucrative than YouTube ad revenue.

“YouTube ad revenue is a really inconsistent way of earning money,” said Rachel. “It fluctuates throughout the year, with advertiser heavy November and December being the highest revenue months and post-holiday January and February being the lowest. You might have some really strong months where multiple videos go viral and you're feeling confident! But you'd better save those checks,  because when January rolls around you’ll start to panic, thinking, 'I shouldn't have celebrated this New Year's with a gym membership and a new haircut!'""

Lisa commented, “People always want to know exactly how much you earn, per view. They want an exact number. The truth is, not even YouTube employees can answer that question because there is so much that goes into calculating that number; everything from how advertiser friendly the video is to audience demographics. As a very loose general rule, I tend to estimate about $1,000 per million views, but sometimes it can be significantly more or less. They key is to diversify your revenue through merchandising, branded partnerships and crowd funding.”

Myth: You get paid based on subscriber number.

“When we hit a million subscribers, and people saw us unboxing that beautiful, shiny, gold play button from YouTube, we had loads of people asking us if it meant we got a bonus or if we started earning more money. I wish! There is no monetary bonus associated with achieving more subscribers. It always shocks me that so many people think that's how it works,"" said Rachel.

Myth: You need huge numbers to be successful in this industry.

Truth: There are tons of opportunities for micro-influencers.

“When we were first starting out, back in 2012, nobody would give you the time of day if your channel had under 100,000 subscribers,"" said Lisa. ""When we had 10,000-20,000 followers, back in 2013, people in the industry would say things to us like, ‘You have no audience.’ Nowadays, in 2018, things are completely different! Brands love working with micro-influencers. We often go on influencer trips, where brands have invited channels of all sizes. There will be influencers there who get less than 1,000 views per video and 100 likes per photo. Some of my friends from high school get more likes than that! What's important to brands is finding a creator that fits their brand messaging and that has the aesthetic that they're looking for. There are a lot of pieces to the puzzle, and views and numbers are just one piece of that. If the influencer has a strong brand, or they're in a niche market, that can be good enough.""

Lisa continued, “I always tell people who want to break into the influencer industry, but feel intimidated by how much competition is already out there, is that there are way more opportunities now than ever before!

Not every brand can afford to hire someone with ten million followers for one video. Nowadays, it feels like almost all brands have some kind of influencer marketing budget and are willing to work with creators of all sizes.”

Myth: Influencers do everything themselves.

Truth: They often have teams of people working around them, such as an editor, a manager, a lawyer, etc.

Rachel said, “Those Instagram photos won't take themselves! Almost everyone uses some form of outside help, whether it’s the resources provided by a manager, a network, an agency, an editor, a lawyer, etc. This is something that really varies depending on the influencer. Some influencers require a lot of assistance with their day-to-day activities, whereas other influencers are more independent and may only bring on outside help for special projects.",
"For the holidays this year you could give your team a party or small gifts or a few extra days off. But if you really want to show them you appreciate them why not give them what they all really want, cute animal snuggles?

Where is this adorable but unexpected suggestion coming from? I was browsing my Twitter feeds this week when I spotted a post that (contrary to Twitter's troll-filled reputation) actually gave increased faith in the goodness of humanity. A business acquaintance who works at Florida-based media company The Penny Hoarder, had shared pictures of her office's animal adoption day. This, I thought, is something more leaders need to know about.

As Alexis Grant, Penny Hoarder executive vice president and cuteness tweeter extraordinaire, explained in an email the idea behind the event was simple. The company's employee experience department had arranged for the local SPCA shelter to bring in a selection of puppies, kittens, and bunnies in need of good homes.

""The company also offered to cover the cost of any adoptions that happened as a result of the cuddle session, and there are several adoptions now in progress,"" Grant reports

This is clearly an awesome idea for so many reasons, but let me just list a few. First, not only do all non-sociopaths (and non-allergy sufferers) love to cuddle furry animals, but unlike a festive margarita happy hour this sort of event actually does some very real good in the world.

""Our shelter takes in 15 new dogs, cats and small animals every day, and we're just a mid-sized shelter. Our partners down the road take in 30 animals every day. That means at least 45 animals in our community are facing homelessness each day,"" reports Martha Boden, the CEO of SPCA Tampa Bay, which organized the event in conjunction with the Penny Hoarder. ""You can make an enormous difference by considering adoption from a shelter first when looking to add a new family pet,"" she adds.

Second, if you need an additional reason beyond adorableness to think bringing a bunch of puppies and kittens into your office is a good idea, psychology is more than willing to help out with studies showing the mere presence of animals make people nicer and more collaborative, and even better leaders. In short, such events aren't just good for homeless pets and a fun afternoon, they're also good for morale and collaboration.

How to set up your own office cuddle session

So what should you do if you're convinced that your office's seasonal festivities need the addition of more cuddly pets in need? ""I would encourage your readers to contact their local humane society, SPCA or animal services agency to see how they can partner to bring more people and animals together,"" Boden wrote me.",
"A relatively young country has chosen a new leader: a president who must face challenges which are very much of the modern world, but which also carry considerable historical weight.

Georgia, the Caucasus nation where Salome Zurabishvili  is about to take up the office of president after her recent election victory, does not see itself as a young country, of course. It can point to centuries of history. It is especially proud  of having become Christian long before the faith was firmly established in western Europe. And yet, in the political sense, its is a young country. For most of the last century, Georgia belonged to the Communist bloc: three decades ago, it was still part of the Soviet Union.

The years since have been scarred by war: civil war in the 1990s, and then war with Russia in 2008. The latter conflict cost Georgia parts of its territory. That summer, Russia invaded to support separatist forces in the Georgian regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Eventually Moscow recognized both as independent countries. There is little prospect of their being reintegrated into Georgia in the foreseeable future.

President Zurabishvili is the first woman to hold that office. Her victory was controversial--writing for the London-based think-tank, Chatham House, Kate Mallinson argued that ""the election was marred by physical violence, vote-buying, misuse of state resources and a substantial imbalance in donations between the parties"". Nevertheless, the new President's background and career so far suggest qualities and experience that she will need to deal with one of the most challenging aspects of her new role: foreign affairs.

In a recent article for the Financial Times, President Zurabishvili recalled the era, when, as the Russian Empire broke up and the Bolsheviks took power, ""Georgia became an independent democratic nation"". That did not last. Three years later, Soviet forces took control and her family ""was forced to flee"".

In consequence, she grew up in France. She joined the French diplomatic service. Later, having served as French ambassador to Georgia, she took Georgian citizenship.

Georgia then was led by President Mikheil Saakashvili: U.S. educated, and a firm friend of the west. He appointed Ms Zurabishvili as foreign minister. Her tenure did not last long, but she did negotiate the deal which led to the withdrawal from Georgia of Russian military bases, placed there during the Soviet era.

In that capacity, she got to know her Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov: then, as now, the Russian Foreign Minister. It may prove to be a useful acquaintance.

For one of the main foreign policy challenges the new President will face is relations with her country's powerful neighbour to the north. When her predecessor, Mr Saakashvili, was in office, the main road from Tbilisi airport to the city centre was named after President George W. Bush. It was a signal how strongly the country then saw its future as being part of the west, as a close ally of the United States in particular. Georgia even sent troops to Iraq as part of the US-led coalition following the 2003 invasion.

Russia was not impressed--Georgia's desire to join NATO then one of the underlying reasons behind the 2008 war. Moscow's dealings with its neighbours -- especially those countries which it once controlled as part of the Soviet Union -- betray a deep suspicion of any who seek closer ties with, or membership of, western institutions. Both Georgia and Ukraine know that can have disastrous consequences. Successful leadership of a post-Soviet state involves making relations with Russia work--however much you look to the west.",None
"Ninety-five percent of CEOs are men, as are 93 percent of heads of state. Gender imbalance exists globally throughout business and government, a byproduct of dated stereotypes and deeply engrained institutional, cultural and operational norms. It’s an immense challenge with no easy answers. So, where do we begin? Like most things, it starts with a conversation among people who have the power to influence change. That’s what happened at the inaugural Women Leaders Global Forum held in Reykjavik, Iceland, in November, where some of the world’s smartest minds across business, government and nonprofits gathered to explore topics related to gender equality, inclusivity and empowering women.

Deloitte chose to collaborate with the forum because it offered a unique opportunity to explore how to harness the power of women leaders in the Fourth Industrial Revolution and lay the foundation for generations to come. Its theme, appropriately, was the impact of digitalization on work and life—how to ensure the next generation of women and girls are ready to lead, and how to equip those young people as they prepare for careers that almost surely will look much different than those we know today.

In fact, the Fourth Industrial Revolution is one of the reasons I’m optimistic about the future. The marriage of physical and digital technologies that defines Industry 4.0 is rapidly transforming the way we work, live and relate to one another. The world is changing so rapidly that it’s estimated two-thirds of children entering primary school today are preparing for jobs that don’t even exist yet.

In other words, traditional job stereotypes and norms are in the process of being erased while the doors of opportunity open wide to all who are prepared—prepared being the operative word. Because equality in business and government can only happen if young women are just as equipped for the future as young men are.

Being in Reykjavik gave Deloitte leaders an opportunity to share our knowledge about the workplace of the future and millennials, and to talk about what we’ve learned on our own journey.

In addition to acknowledging that digitalization, and the impact it has on all aspects of our lives, brings unique opportunities that we must take advantage of collectively to lay the foundation for the change we want to drive, Deloitte speakers discussed how:

Gender and inclusion efforts are most successful when they are supported by the right environments, cultures and policies. That’s why Deloitte is making conscious efforts to enhance those elements across the 150 + countries and territories we operate in, increasing the number of women leaders globally, and preparing the next generation of women leaders to reach their full potential.

It’s also why Deloitte is proud to support the Women Leaders Global Forum. In the 21st century, the march toward equality and inclusion in business and government must become a sprint.

Events like this are where real progress begins.",
"In my work with Millennials, one of the important things I’ve learned is that this generation of workers are self-driven lifelong learners. A recent Ernst and Young study on Millennials backs this up, with 56 percent of survey participants ages 20 to 36 believing it is up to themselves to seek skills and opportunities proactively, wherever they are offered.

Part of the reason is that there is not—in any field—just one career path with clear milestones to hit to reach the top. And in today’s rapidly changing business place, there is a critical need to be open and flexible to the learnings and opportunities that come your way. They may get you where you want to go in a different, faster way or they may take you down an entirely new and more fulfilling path.

My recent conversation with Dr. Judith Rodin who was just named to the Board of Directors of Trilogy Education gave me some deeper insight into just how important it is to not over-manage your career.

Rodin was the first female President of an Ivy League university, the University of Pennsylvania, as well as President of the Rockefeller Foundation. She brings her wealth of expertise in higher education to the workforce accelerator, which partners with universities and companies to provide much-needed professional training for in-demand skills in the growing tech industry.

Rodin shared with me her own illustrious career path and how being open to new opportunities and learning new skills has helped her. She didn’t limit herself to having just one career goal that she pursued relentlessly.

‘When I left Penn, I didn't know what was next. I said I'm going to take time off and write a book about what we did in West Philadelphia, and then opportunities came knocking. I looked at things that were in entirely different fields than I could have ever imagined. Being CEO of a Fortune 100 company; aggregating a group of privately held companies and IPO-ing them; Rockefeller. I couldn't have imagined any of those 10 years earlier when I was offered the Penn presidency. Making yourself resilient and nimble and agile is, I think, a critical skill that women need to develop.”

Rodin emphasized that this openness is especially important to women, given the competing desires to succeed professionally and care for family.

“I really want women to understand that they can do that, that they don't need the perfect life plan because life intrudes. You make your own luck by being really good, by working hard, by putting yourself out there, and then things will happen.”

“First, it is being open to the recognition that you are going to do multiple things. There is a lifelong trajectory; understand that you are going to need to do those things in phases. I also think that you need to be open to luck and opportunity. You need to be the best you can be at what you're doing right now, and then things come along that you never could have or would have planned for. Openness, nimbleness, flexibility while you're doing all this planning, also mental and actual agility is going to be critical .”

One of the reasons why Rodin is so committed to the work of Trilogy Education is how the company prepares professionals of all ages to be agile so they can jump on new opportunities as the needs of the workplace change.

“Trilogy is a conscious career inflection point for me. What Trilogy has created is a model for that kind of ‘up-skilling’ in a very effective way. It'll never replace, and it's not meant to replace the traditional business school or engineering school. It's really working at a different phase of the lifelong learner's cycle where it can ‘re-skill’ or ‘up-skill’ those who hadn't had the benefit of higher education and re-skill those who have but feel like they're lagging behind as the pace of innovation is accelerating. For women, reentering the job market, for example, this is a perfect model to get those new skills.”

With so few women at the top, there really is no traditional career roadmap we can follow to emulate their successes. But what we can do is look to them for what we admire about their journeys and see how they apply to our own lives.

Who has a career that you find appealing?

Which aspects of their success do you want to replicate in your own life and career?

What skills do they possess that you can learn?

What has been their impact on their company, their industry, their community or the world at large?

One of my favorite exercises in the workshops I lead with students and early career professionals is called “Study the Stars” where I encourage them to mine through LinkedIn using keywords of interest to find new people with impressive and interesting career paths.  Everyone’s journey is different and can inspire you to consider new experiences or skills to bolster your credibility and expertise. I echo Dr. Rodin’s vision for committing to being a lifelong learner where we strive to stay curious, agile and open to new skills and possibilities.",
"Purchasing a wine farm may seem an indulgence or a trendy lifestyle decision for the rich and famous, but when assessing this investment option from a more holistic and objective perspective, it is clear that significant benefits are being realized by those who are successfully leveraging the opportunities that a wine farm can offer. This situation is especially relevant for family businesses that reap the rewards not just limited to commercial gain but also within the essential areas of brand-building and generational succession.

According to Viva Business, global experts in winery acquisition, the popularity of this investment has grown exponentially over the last twenty years. No longer just a passion purchase, buyers are increasingly considering financial gain in their decision-making. Financial advisors and wealth managers are also endorsing this investment, seeing wineries as a means to diversify a client’s portfolio and hedge against often erratic returns of stocks and other investments. Looking at the U.S. market as an example, it is clear that the wine industry has been in a very healthy space over the last couple of decades with annual consumption almost doubling to over 770 million gallons. The wine industry is dominated by families, with the majority of the 2000 wineries in California being family-owned, including globally recognized brands such as Gallo. California wineries alone provide a massive stimulus of approximately $45.4 billion to the California economy. Although past performance suggests that wine farms are a potentially lucrative investment for family businesses, buyers should be aware that a winery acquisition should be purchased correctly and for the right reasons. Expert advice should be secured, and due diligence is a must to avoid overpaying or buying in the wrong region.

Unlike investing in stocks or bonds, this type of investment should be viewed more in the context of land and property value, not only as an income producing asset. Also, consumption growth is not guaranteed. The State of the Wine Industry 2018 report, which details U.S. wine consumption trends, indicates ""After more than 20 years of straight-line growth trends, total volume growth is leveling out."" Author, Rob McMillan, claims that ""Winery owners, who have seen grape prices escalate markedly over the past five years, are finding that cost increases are difficult to pass on to new consumers, who are signaling that they have a lower indulgence ceiling than have prior generations."" Hence, the report predicts that "" Successful wineries ten years from now will be those that have adapted to a different consumer with different values. "" The bottom line is that caution needs to be exercised in purchasing a wine farm, but if the fundamentals are good and the assets are leveraged optimally, it can still be an excellent long-term investment.

According to a Wine Institute article on the California Wine Industry: ""A unique feature about California's wine families is that the family name is often on the wine label. This usually means that the family will choose the path to quality in business or production decisions because its family name, and thus its reputation, is at stake."" The report continues that, ""Family members tend to be loyal and dedicated to the family enterprise, and the family presence in winery jobs provides continuity in passing institutional knowledge on to others at the winery.""  This results in members other working harder to keep the business in the family and pass it to the next generation.

The Wine Institute continues: ""California's wine families become versed in all aspects of the wine business, learning grape-growing, winemaking, marketing and hospitality in the tasting room and events. Throughout California, wine lovers can meet the interesting personalities behind their favorite wines. This is a trend that is not unique to California and demonstrates how a winery can be leveraged to add substance and heritage to a family’s name and reputation.""

As much as a wine farm can deliver attractive financial returns and enhance a family’s reputation, it is also an enjoyable and experiential lifestyle investment. Not only does the nature of the wine business lend itself to a family-managed approach, but it also significantly improves the chances of effective next-generation succession due to the attractiveness of becoming commercially active in an enjoyable product.

Tondi Bolkan, the winemaker from Francis Ford Coppola Winery, a family-owned wine farm would agree, ""Our owner Francis Ford Coppola is more involved than ever with new visions and ideas. What’s more exciting is the involvement of the next generation of the family (Roman, Sofia, and granddaughter Gia) in the businesses. It will be exciting to watch The Family Coppola business in the upcoming years!""

Purchasing a quality wine farm can be a sensible option when looking at diversifying your portfolio and taking a long-term view on building family brand equity and encouraging multi-generational participation in the family business. However, it is an investment that requires active involvement and should be guided by expert advice.",
"“You learn more by your failures in the film industry than the wins. The wins are great. But you have to take them with a grain of salt,” says Universal Studios Chairwoman Donna Langley on navigating Hollywood’s high-stakes movie business. In her 17-year tenure at Universal, the movie maven has guided the studio to unparalleled growth, crossing $4 billion at the worldwide box office in 2018 for the second time in the company’s 105-year history. Langley credits her ability to weather some of Universal’s most perilous years, which included a string of very public flops, as pivotal in shaping her record-breaking success.  “Everything we do is a high-wire act. It's a big swing... You can either crumble under the weight and the enormity of the setback, or you can take stock of it, learn from it in ways that you can, and forge ahead ,” says Langley. “You really have to have your gut instinct intact for that.”

As one of the few women at the entertainment industry apex, Langley has also remained steadfast in her mission to push beyond the Hollywood mainstream. Having greenlit films that better represent the broader audiences the entertainment industry serves, from “Get Out” to “Girls Trip” and “Straight Outta Compton, Langley’s proven time and again that cultivating a diverse slate of talent and story themes yields bottom-line benefits. “We tell stories. We have the power to bring stories to people all over the world...That’s an incredibly powerful thing. We have the power to enable new voices to be heard. There’s nothing more exciting than doing that ,” she says.

Langley is using that same power to pay her hard-won success forward, from lending her voice to the Time’s Up initiative to advocating for greater access to mentorship opportunities for women globally. Passionate about empowering the next generation of leaders, Langley is an ambassador and board member for the nonprofit Vital Voices, where her work with mentees around the world has inspired her both personally and professionally. Of the greatest wisdom she's garnered from her work with the organization, Langley says, “As separated as we may by culture, language or religion, we’re ultimately all the same.”

I recently sat down with Langley to discuss diversity in Hollywood, pushing past self-doubt, and rising through the ranks of the big studio movie business. Edited highlights below.

""You must learn a great deal from failures, because it's the only way that you're not necessarily going to repeat those things a second time. An organization is defined by failure much more than success. How an organization is able to come together or not when things are not going well defines its leadership. It defines the culture.”

On Knowing Your Own Value:

“To know the value that you bring to your work every day really helps you keep up your self-esteem. Because not every day are you going to get a pat on the head from somebody else. You have to be a self-starter in your own journey in that way.”

""Whether you're an artist or whether you're a business leader, everyone just wants the honest truth. And sometimes honesty is a difficult thing to deliver. You may be telling somebody something that they don't want to hear. But, one of the elements I think that makes a creative process successful is for everybody to be very honest around the shared vision. Where problems can happen is when one group of people thinks outcome is going to be one thing, and the other group thinks it's another.""

On The Right Way To Delegate:

“It’s certainly a daily challenge to walk in the door every day and not get fully consumed by what we call ‘the patient on the table,’ or whatever you’re doing that day that requires you triage. Sometimes it's inevitable. It boils down to time management. You may have to step into the operating room because you're the only one that can perform the operation. But then you do the operation and you have to step away. It’s about saying, Okay, I'm going dedicate this amount of time here. Because if I stay any longer, then we're going to have another fire to put out over here.’ It goes back to delegating, and getting your team around you to do the ‘aftercare.’”

On Motherhood Making Her A Better Executive:

""Being able to manage and juggle two small kids, and a home, and a family is sort of like running a small soccer team. There are many instances at work and at home that really kind of mirror in terms the skills that you need to bring to the table, whether it's a negotiation or just an outright consequence to something. It brings a great deal of clarity to the equation.”

On Her Advice To Her Younger Self:

“I think if I was going back with a letter written to my 20-year-old self, it would say on the front, ""Only open in case of emergency."" There is nothing I would want my 20-year-old self to know that I know now because it's all about the journey. It's all about learning every step of the way and each experience that leads to a new skill set that you can put in your big bag of tricks, your big toolbox. I wouldn't give one minute of my career up for an earlier perspective. I wouldn't do it.”",
"Anne Alonzo has career experience that spans the public, private and not-for-profit sectors. During NAFTA trade negotiations, she served as the EPA’s first diplomat to the U.S. Embassy in Mexico. Later, during the Obama Administration, the White House appointed her to serve as its Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which finds her where she is now — as the President and CEO of the American Egg Board.

“The American Egg Board is the national commodity marketing board for the U.S. egg industry, which funds all of our activities,” shares Alonzo. “My specific role is to lead a wonderful, dynamic team of marketing, research and administrative professionals as we advance national campaigns in advertising, public relations, consumer education, retail, foodservice, export marketing and egg nutrition.”

As one of the few Latinas at the helm of larger organizations, Alonzo chooses to share how she’s navigated career changes and embraced her Latinidad along the way.

“When I felt that I was no longer contributing and learning and/or there was an organizational change afoot, it became clear that it was time to move on and I started to create the opportunities and positioning to transition,” noted Alonzo.

For her this meant moving between government roles and private roles, like serving as Kraft Foods’ Vice President of Global Public Policy.

Below Alonzo shares insight into her experience transitioning into and out of the private sector, what advice she has for Latinas, and how she’s honed her leadership style.

Vivian Nunez: How easy or difficult was it for you to transition between the public and private sector?

Anne Alonzo: While it’s been challenging to transition between sectors—especially at the highest levels—I’ve viewed the transitions as learning experiences, I was determined to succeed and also have fun.

At the end of the day, I believe it’s about focus and figuring out the organization’s priorities, what success means in that particular role and integrating with an organization’s culture. These transitions have also made me much more adaptable and situationally aware.

Nunez: How has your Latinidad influenced the trajectory of your career?

Alonzo: My Latinidad has been a tremendously positive influence on my career. I’m so privileged to have a different life view with a colorful, passionate and proud culture, to be able to speak (and often dream) in a different language and to have shared in this background with other Latinos and non-Latinos. Diversity has been a strength.

Nunez: What advice do you have for Latinx who are just starting their careers?

Alonzo: Take risks, learn and have fun. At the same time, time is precious, so be purposeful and focused. Don’t waste your time.

Nunez: You’re one of the few Latina CEOs — what does this mean to you?

Alonzo: I feel very fortunate and grateful. At the same time, I want other Latina(o)s to reach their potential—to climb to the top of their mountains. In that regard, I believe it’s my personal responsibility to model and make myself available to mentor and work with other Latina(os) on their journeys.

Nunez: How was your leadership style honed as a result of being in such male-dominated spaces?

Alonzo: I’ve always been in male-dominated spaces from law school to business school to working in foreign countries to agriculture. I believe that being in these spaces has helped make me competitive and focused. Overall, though, I view being a woman as an advantage—a positive. The key for a leader—man or woman—is to be prepared and confident!",
"I was still new to sales when my parents invited me to attend a leadership conference. I was in awe of the prolific, common-sense wisdom coming from the speaker on the stage. I soaked up his every word. His name was Zig Ziglar.

That morning, Ziglar talked about a sticking point in many people’s development journey: procrastination. It's a cunning companion that prevents us from getting around to things we want to accomplish.

Ziglar is well-known for using a wooden token called a “Round Tuit"" as a motivational tool. The phrase ""Round Tuit"" is a play on the words “As soon as I get around to it.” He used the tokens to remind people not to fall into the trap of procrastination.

I was so impressed that I left the conference with a bag full of Round Tuits that I strategically placed around my house, office and car. They reminded me that if I was going to meet my goals, it was up to me to take concrete action steps and make things happen. The Round Tuits inspired me to hold myself accountable, to be responsible and to take ownership.

Are You Having Trouble Inspiring Productivity?

Accountability, responsibility and ownership are crucial to unleashing maximum results. What I often hear from leaders, however, is that business development representatives and younger salespeople, in particular, seem to lack these essential characteristics. It’s not surprising, since research from Objective Management Group — whose assessments I use for my clients — shows that 60% of sales professionals have weak levels of responsibility.

As you aim to grow sales, crack new accounts or tap new markets, salespeople who struggle with procrastination and a refusal to take personal accountability and ownership will be a perennial thorn in your side. Blame-shifting and excuse-making will result in consistent underperformance. If they have a Round Tuit, it is buried in a drawer.

How To Teach Accountability Through 'Feed-Forward' Coaching

We all know what feedback is. However, I find that a ""feed-forward"" approach yields excellent coaching results. With a feed-forward approach, instead of focusing on what went wrong in the past, you ask questions that have a future focus. These questions will guide your up-and-coming millennial salespeople toward accountability, creativity and a solution-oriented mindset versus complaining, sluggishness and a blame-game mindset.

Here are three practical coaching strategies you can start using right away:

When your millennial salespeople fail to execute an important task, they may point their fingers at others on the team or in the company. Challenge them to own their actions by reframing the statements they make.

Blame-game statement: “Paul was supposed to give me the updated figures before my sales call, but he didn’t.”

Feed-forward coaching: “Set aside Paul’s role in all of this. What might you do differently next time to get the results you want?”

Some emerging millennial sales leaders come up with creative excuses to attribute poor performance to forces outside their control. When they make excuses for not getting a sale — like blaming the competition’s lower price point — they tacitly declare themselves to be powerless. Research shows that only 53% of all salespeople are able to sell value, which is a successful strategy to counter your competitor’s cheaper offering. Work with your millennial salespeople to reframe excuses as a statement of personal empowerment and conviction.

Excuse statement: “I didn’t get the sale because the competition offered a much lower price.”

Feed-forward coaching: “That is indeed a challenge. How might you change your approach to overcome the competition and sell our higher-value offering?”

In highly competitive markets, status quo players can be cancerous to the entire sales effort. According to Objective Management Group, 86% of salespeople have sales beliefs that sabotage, rather than support, their sales outcomes. Unless there's an intentional, strategic effort to shift those beliefs to support your strategic sales plan, the sales team will get the same results they've gotten in the past. Experienced leaders know that beliefs drive behaviors, and behaviors drive results. To train accountable millennial salespeople, encourage them to convert their negative sales beliefs into positive behaviors.

Stagnation statement: “I’ll never make these targets, so why even try? There’s nothing I can do about it.”

Feed-forward coaching: “What might you do to strengthen your sales activities, attitudes or skills so that you can reach your goals?”

Skillful leaders use action-oriented questions to empower their salespeople. They know that casting blame and focusing on what went wrong is counterproductive. Instead, they direct their coaching and mentoring energy to the future action and solution.

So give your up-and-coming millennial salespeople what they’re looking for: feed-forward. Work with them to show what accountability looks like, and dynamically train them toward self-sufficiency.

The ball is in your court to coach your millennial employees on how to reach their full potential. Procrastination doesn't have to be a sticking point in their accountability journey any longer.",
"In 2014, H&R Block paid $145,000 to settle a suit filed by the U.S. Justice Department that claimed the company’s website, created by HRB Digital LLC (the business’s digital development unit), violated Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act. In 2008, Target was forced to pay $6 million in damages related to its online checkout process.

More surprising, however, is the fact that both of those businesses could have actually saved time and resources in development and maintenance and delivered a universally better user experience had they designed for accessibility in the first place. So, how can that be?

Designing for users with visual impairments doesn't pose a challenge, but an opportunity. There are standard information hierarchies that have been established because they offer increased familiarity for most users, which, in turn, translates into a navigational structure that feels more intuitive.

Working within these hierarchies forces a user experience (UX) or user interface (UI) designer to be deliberate about how every navigational choice relates or ladders up to every other choice (e.g., does the visual order align with the reading order? Is there a logical order to keyboard navigation?).

Designing for accessibility requires that the presentation layer and the data layer fall into distinct groupings within the code -- something called “source order.” Going back to the earlier point of aligning the visual order with the reading order, source order means structuring the code to reflect the visual design of the layout.

Adhering to this code structure provides a myriad of benefits. Accessible websites generally yield improved search results (more on that in a minute), lower maintenance costs and increased audience reach. Simplifying and clarifying the paths to information for impaired users also simplifies those same paths for search engines and anyone needing to make code modifications at a later date.

Part of designing for accessibility involves adding tags and metadata to your UI elements. This act of attaching an underlying description of what an element is or represents has the added value of enhancing contextual meaning that search engines consume as they crawl your site. In the SEO game, keywords are a dime a dozen, but context is pure gold.

As an added bonus, sites designed for accessibility generally adhere to more widely accepted design and code standards, which results in better performance on a wider variety of current and legacy browsers. And it seems a fair assumption that these sites will perform better as today’s browsers are updated to new versions.

It’s the right thing to do.

The problem with our digital properties is that, unlike when encountering an inaccessible brick and mortar business, the struggles of those with disabilities are rarely witnessed. There may be abandoned sessions in our analytics, but they’re without context.

An adage says that a true test of character is how one acts when no one is looking. We should all be designing to create an experience that’s as inclusive as possible.

Being a conscientious corporate citizen can provide measurable market advantages. As an example, 87% of millennials will choose a brand based solely on causes they support. And according to a 2015 study by LIM College, nearly two-thirds of millennials place high loyalty value on brands that engage in causes, philanthropy or endeavors that reflect their beliefs and values.

Therefore, it’s fair to assume brands that can effectively demonstrate greater social value, both among their existing customers and the general population, will have a greater chance of attracting brand evangelists and maintaining loyalty.

Be a good citizen of the world (wide web).

As designers, we tend to have knee-jerk reactions to constraints, as if they somehow limit creativity when, in fact, we all intellectually understand that constraints are a necessary part of the process.

Designing for accessibility follows a similar cognitive journey. First, we assume the constraints will hamper creativity or slow development when in the long-run, they actually support every UX designer's goal -- to minimize the effort or time it takes to connect a user with the action or information with which they wish to engage. It's better for users. It's better for designers and developers. And it's better for society. That's a real WWW (win-win-win) for everyone.",
"We’re finally in the holiday homestretch, and the latest survey data from Prosper Insights & Analytics reveal an abundance of insights into how US consumers are approaching their last-minute shopping. Here, we pick out four digital retail trends that emerged from our December survey of US consumers.

E-commerce may often be characterized as a functional experience but consumers are much more likely to be satisfied with their shopping experience when buying online than when buying in stores. Our December survey found that the proportion of consumers rating online as excellent or very good was an impressive 67.6% compared to just 51.5% for in-store experiences.

As we show below, the online channel yields a significantly higher response for “excellent” experiences than do physical stores. And, despite the logistical hurdles associated with getting orders delivered to consumers, less than 1% rated their online shopping experience as poor. Good job, Internet retailers!

These high satisfaction levels are driving nearly 51% of all shoppers to buy online this December, up fractionally from the 50.5% rate recorded in December 2017. The proportion of shoppers planning to undertake holiday shopping online in December has changed little since 2013. Consumer concerns about delivery in time for Christmas Day may be a barrier to higher penetration rates.

“The leveling off in December online shopper numbers suggests that retailers that sell only or mainly online have to capture more spend from online shoppers by driving up basket size and number of transactions,” says Deborah Weinswig, CEO and Founder of research and advisory firm Coresight Research. “More rapid delivery options that would ensure delivery before December 25 would encourage customers to make more last-minute purchases online.”

3. Smartphones are Moving Beyond E-Commerce to Find a Place in In-Store Shopping

For almost 70% of US shoppers, mobile devices will play a part in the shopping journey this holiday season – but product research will continue to outrank product purchase. However, this year, smartphones will be more than tools for shoppers to browse and buy products: We found around one-quarter of shoppers plan to use mobile devices to redeem coupons and 10% plan to make in-store payments using mobile devices. Plans to redeem coupons or make in-store mobile payments peaks in the 25–34 age group, possibly reflecting that this demographic is more tech savvy than older demographics but also more financially organized than younger consumers.

“This data indicates that smartphones are becoming a more important component of in-store shopping,” concludes Weinswig. “Consumers have long used smartphones to compare prices when in a store. Now, sizeable numbers of consumers are using smartphones to cash in coupons and make in-store payments. This underscores how important it is for retailers to place the mobile at the heart of their digital strategies, from product discovery to payment.”

Our survey also found a shift in digital payment usage toward newer players, including mobile payment services that offer in-store payment options When we asked consumers whether they had used various digital payment providers in holiday shopping, Apple Pay and Samsung Pay, which offer face-to-face payments, registered a usage increase compared to last year. We also saw an uptick for Venmo, a PayPal-owned service for online, in-app and peer-to-peer payments. PayPal remained by far the most used of these providers, though it slipped in user numbers year over year — meaning it likely lost market share to mobile payment apps growing from a smaller base.

Usage of these payment methods was typically highest in the 25–34 age group. However, Venmo saw a strong peak in usage in the 18–24 age group, confirming the brand’s resonance with young millennials and Gen Zers.",
"The end versus means tradeoff is not a new quandary. It’s been an ethical argument showing up in ideas like Utilitarianism – the greatest good for the greatest number. It’s been a political argument with people like Machiavelli arguing that, “in the actions of all men…one judges by the result.” It’s an ongoing leadership question in terms of the tradeoff between values and results.

It’s a false choice. Organizations that survive and thrive over time deliver end results with a strong, sound, sustainable culture rooted in core values and beliefs.

At one level, how to break the end versus means tradeoff is by refusing to make that tradeoff. At another level this requires two-track leadership. Lead what is required to deliver performance and end results. And lead culture in a way that no one will make unacceptable tradeoffs of means.

Carpedia’s Andrew Rush took me through their alignment process, which they call “the key to predictable and more profitable results.” At a high level, this includes:

As Rush explained, “First, you need to clearly define for your organization what the goal is this year. Once you have that, you need to figure out how everyone in your organization contributes to that goal. This needs to be as objective as possible. Everything that cannot be measured will have a marginal level of effectiveness.

As you do this, you will naturally go from a high level, singular goal, into smaller goals. Your time horizon will go from indicators that you can measure on an annual basis, to monthly, weekly and then hopefully daily. You will have different measures in sales, marketing, accounting, operations, etc. that will all mathematically align to the overall goal.”

Another way to think about this is in terms of cascading priorities, managed with different time frames at different levels of the organization:

Strategic Priorities -- multi-year impact -- track and adjust annually or quarterly.

Programs -- that move the strategic priorities forward -- track and adjust monthly.

Projects -- that make up the programs -- track and adjust weekly.

Tasks -- that make up the day-to-day work of the programs -- track and adjust daily or more frequently as appropriate.

Carpedia suggests these result from Active Management and Active Problem Solving. Rush explains Active Management as, “Once you have defined what the goal is and made it clear to everyone how they contribute to that goal, you now need a cadence by which you communicate it throughout the organization and follow up against the aligned plan.”

Rush told me that, “When the follow up is done, there will undoubtedly be times when variances to the plan are uncovered. How leaders analyze these variances and remove problems, so they don’t occur again in the future is what we call Active Problem Solving.“ This goes to how you’re going to adjust behaviors as you track priorities, programs, projects and tasks.

Rush explained that, “As a leader, you have to identify the three most important behaviors that are going to drive your business forward and make these part of your core values. Once established, defined and communicated, you now need to “listen for values”. In every conversation that you have with your employees you need to listen on two levels; the first is for the exchange or information, and the second is what is being conveyed done in a manner that is consistent with your core values.”

Another approach to this is to be clear with all what policies and core values are mandatory, bedrock and unchangeable and what guidelines or guiding principles are open to interpretation or evolution. Sustainable alignment happens when all know their own ends, the impact of those ends and the effect of that impact on others – and when they know which policies and values to follow and which guidelines or guiding principles to evolve.",

"Ten of the most important skills that form a highly effective leader. Are you a born leader or do you need to adapt your skill set to get ahead? How can you nurture your team to perform and deliver efficiently? Continue reading to find out more.

People often see leadership as a trait rather than what could be acquired or achieved. As the saying goes “not all are born to rule or lead”. This has instilled the misconception that the attributes of effective leadership are for only those born with “silver spoons”.  By choice, hierarchy, position or by endorsement, an individual will find him/herself in the position to lead at a particular time or stage in his or her lifetime. Whether you aspire to be a manager at work, an entrepreneur, or even as a parent, you need to possess these essential habits to lead your followers effectively.

According to the saying, 'dress the way they want to be addressed', in the same way, an effective leader should carry the quality of being outstanding in their personality to gain the desired respect. Good leaders are often distinguishable and set positive examples in every aspect of leadership.

The self-consciousness of being professional in the way you carry out your daily tasks will earn you confidence from the people you lead. Your principles, views, actions and relationships with people should be distinguished. You will need to execute plans or skills with dexterity and prudence.

As Winston Churchill once said, “The nation will find it very hard to look up to the leaders who are keeping their ears to the ground.” Thus effective leaders should always carry great interpersonal skills. Leadership entails communication. Not just speaking, but any good relationship should be mutual enough to allow for both speaking and listening. What effect is communication, if it only involves speaking?  A good leader should create avenues to listen to the people he or she leads.

A strong presence of your personality, the charm that revolves around your aura inspires other people around you. It can be labelled as a personal magnetism that attracts people of both ordinary and great personalities. It is the force that draws fans to musicians, loyalists to great leaders, business partners to business magnates. And it inspires followers or employees to unite together in a common pursuit of goals.

A highly-effective leader should get into the habit of understanding scenarios which includes making judgments. They should be able to view situations both from their perspective and those of the characters involved. Discernment is considered a virtue, especially in leadership. A highly effective leader should possess the virtue of discerning between wrongs and rights. Making unbiased judgments will gain trustworthiness and belief from the people you lead.

Offering eloquent presentations are a very effective way of imparting strong messages that will allow a speaker to win his or her listeners’ hearts and keeps them yearning to hear more. A vocal leader who passes messages across in a colourful, commanding, yet humble manner will be a role model to many. Most great leaders speak to their followers in such manners that leaves them well respected.  When Theresa May, in her persuasive, yet humble manner, addressed the British Congress in calming fears over the controversial “Brexit”. This certainly earned her respect.

The ability to show a strong desire and determination to succeed is what motivates people to be chosen as leaders. Being ambitious is to believe in oneself. An ambitious leader is the one that has the ability to use their energy to drive their plans and ideas towards attaining a successful goal.

You must be able to think or plan the future with imagination or wisdom.  Vision is the guide that directs all successful leaders. You should be able to come out with a vision and plan on a roadmap to success in any organization you want to lead. “I have a dream” made the introductory part of the speech delivered by Martin Luther King Jnr, during his emancipation proclamation in August 1963. He had a vision that his people would be emancipated from racism which was a dream come true. The awesome leadership of renowned organisations all started with visions (however small they may be) that made them the most talked about brands.

Be a lady or a gentleman of integrity. Possess qualities of honesty and have good moral principles. Integrity is all about doing the right thing; even when no one is watching. Integrity is an ethic all great leaders should possess. It entails moral principles and actions of high values worthy of emulation. Act at all times according to your integrity that cannot be influenced by wrong practices or prejudice. As Dwight Eisenhower once said “The supreme quality for leadership is unquestionable integrity, without it, no success is possible, no matter whether it is on a section gang, a football field, or in an office”

Work in synergy with members of your team.  Seek members’ opinions and come out with the best-fit ideas in setting goals. Planning together, working together and achieving a common success will not just give you (as a leader) the much-deserved applause but will generate a lively team-spirit that is willing to work efficiently on subsequent future projects. Teamwork brings unity and strengthens bonds between a leader and members of his or her team.

The happiness and quality of life, both material and psychological should be of priority to any great leader. The most remarkable thing all great leaders either dead or alive is remembered for is their selflessness.  A highly effective leader is the person who shows concern for people’s welfare. They realize the personality of others and respect their civil rights. Self-centeredness or egoism are habits that should be discouraged.  Effective leaders should show selflessness in the ways they manage their teams.  Be ready to sacrifice (wisely) for the benefits of everyone.

Highly effective leadership can be built if you try to possess these habits mentioned above.  You do not have to practice them all at once. Rather, you can be groomed and shaped progressively.

Always remember, it is not the great things a man did that made him great, but the little things he did in great ways.

As Nelson Mandela, a man who showed selfless leadership once said, “It is better to lead from behind and put others in front, especially when you celebrate victory when nice things occur. You take the front line when there is a danger. Then people will appreciate your leadership.”",None
"Whether it’s asking for a raise or speaking with an investor, it can be difficult for many professionals to find the right balance when negotiating. No one wants to ask for too little, undervaluing their work, or ask for too much, potentially ruining the chance of an agreement. It takes finesse, awareness and social acumen to negotiate well.

Skillful negotiating can be learned, and it’s wise to study the suggestions of those with experience. We asked 15 members of Forbes Coaches Council to share their top strategies for becoming more adept at negotiations.

Instead of focusing on the position of the other person or what it is that they are saying, really ask questions to learn about the real interests that they have. Get under the surface and really understand what it is that they really need out of the negotiation so that you can find a win-win solution. By getting to win-win, both parties will feel good and get what they need. - Monica Thakrar, MTI

Don’t have an adversarial, competitive mindset about negotiating. Instead, approach it with the goal of achieving a mutually satisfying outcome for both sides. Conduct yourself as though you’re certain that a great result can be achieved if you and the person on the other side of the table work together as members of a team. Maintaining positivity and an affable demeanor throughout is critical. - Carroll Welch, Carroll Welch Consulting

3. Believe In The Value You Bring

If you go into a tough negotiation feeling like someone will be doing you a favor by giving you a raise or investing, you’ve already lost. Going in knowing the value you deliver will give you the confidence to advocate for yourself. Put yourself in the other person’s shoes and ask yourself what would impress you about that person who is asking for the money. - Tim Ressmeyer, Ressmeyer Partners

It’s important to recognize that if you don’t negotiate for a living you likely aren’t aware of all the things you might negotiate, their dollar value and the opportunity for upping your salary. No one wants to excitedly take a job and realize they shorted themselves tens of thousands of dollars annually! So, be sure to find a resource, such as a well-rated book or coach, and learn and practice. - Laura DeCarlo, Career Directors International

5. Always Ask For More

I’ve learned that when it comes to negotiations, always ask for more. If the employee asks for more money, ask them for more productivity. If a client asks for a lower price, sell them more products. It’s much easier to negotiate after the other person thinks they won. Let them win the first negotiation, and they will usually be happy enough to let you win two to three more. - Ryan Stewman, Break Free Academy

6. Find Out What’s Really Possible

People can’t negotiate to provide things they don’t have. Figure out what the other person has the power to provide. For example, I once negotiated around an impending acquisition, trying to get off the “stay” list onto the “layoff” list. During the critical conversation I realized the person had no power to change outcomes. So I quickly shifted to negotiate our continued working relationship. - Ronica Roth, CA Technologies

Becoming an effective negotiator in any situation begins with ego and mouth management by the negotiator. The good negotiator knows herself and her triggers well so that nothing said or done can derail her objectivity or her goal of win-win for the parties involved. - Judy Nelson, Judy Nelson Executive Coach

If you practice or rehearse, do what is taught in school through improv and additional techniques. Understand, articulate and play out the role of the person you intend to negotiate with. Understand the points of the so-called “opposition” during or even before you intend to argue your case for a raise, for investment or for any promotion. This will allow you to build your case convincingly. - John M. O’Connor, Career Pro Inc.

Most of the time when you have trouble negotiating it is either fear of conflict or fear of being told “no” that stops you. First, identify what you are afraid of. Then ask yourself, “If that happens, will I be okay?” This calms your brain’s automatic amygdala hijack and allows you to be present in the conversation. Then, before you go into the negotiation, write out the case for your deserving the money. - Janet Zaretsky, Empowered Women Enterprisess, LLC dba Janet Zaretsky

Make more eye contact. By looking them in the eye and holding their gaze, you will signal you are serious and committed to your ideas. Eye contact also helps you analyze the other person’s body language and gestures to determine how they perceive you so you can adjust how you deliver your message. - G. Riley Mills, Pinnacle Performance Company

People often worry that they will be perceived as greedy, demanding or ungrateful when they go into a negotiation, but negotiations aren’t personal. Negotiations are an opportunity for everyone involved to get more of what they want. Ask for your desired outcome confidently, with no attachment. Once you find out what the other person wants and has to say, you’ll be able to meet in the middle. - Amanda Frances, Amanda Frances Inc.

12. Know What You’re Willing To Lose

A key for any negotiation is being able to know not just what you want, but what you are willing to lose. Are you willing to lose an investor to keep a greater share in your company? Are you willing to lose a chance at a promotion if it means you can get more vacation time? If you know what you are willing to lose or give up, you will be better prepared to push for what you are unwilling to yield. - Billy Williams, Archegos

Negotiations require two sides working together to arrive at a compromised outcome. The best negotiators present their request and then listen, really listen, for feedback from the other side. They listen for clues and cues and use the information to structure and negotiate accordingly. When both sides feel they have received benefit, the close comes easier. - Deborah Hightower, Deborah Hightower, Inc.

We’re negotiating for things all the time — where we want to go to eat for lunch, or how much time we should spend on a project. We have these micro negotiations with ourselves and others all the time. To become more comfortable, remember that you are simply having a conversation to come to a consensus on what “right” will look like for you and the other person. - Lynda Foster, Cortex Leadership Consulting

15. Stay On Top Of The Latest Tactics

I highly recommend podcasts, books and even classes to stay on top of the latest  negotiation and sales tactics available today. My team trains every Tuesday for an hour and then another hour one-on-one with a professional sales trainer who knows sales and negotiation techniques. We currently use Sandler Training, but there are many to recommend. - Gene Russell, Manex Consulting",
"One of the most challenging aspects of diversity and inclusion (D&I) is being able to quantify the value of a program or training that has been implemented in the workplace. When seeking leadership buy-in for your diversity program, it is imperative to figure out how to measure the value that your program can provide to the organization. How do you gauge D&I goal attainment? How can you quantify the impact of D&I measures? What strategies can be utilized to assess D&I practices?

When assessing D&I practices, it is important to first understand where the organization is at, from the starting point. D&I is extremely vast, so narrowing down which areas your organization should focus on will help when implementing or improving D&I practices. Conduct an initial survey of the diversity climate within the organization. This could include an employee engagement survey, with questions focused specifically on company culture and inclusion. You could also assess customer feedback through customer surveys, social media comments and Glassdoor ratings. It’s imperative to assess demographics within the organization to ensure that fair hiring practices are taking place. Evaluate turnover rates, promotion and salary, as well as the candidate pipeline as indicators of whether the organization is on the right track. Some sample metrics that can be used to assess D&I practices include: velocity of movement (length of time it takes to hire, promote and move up within the organization), succession plans for diverse employees, percentage of diverse employees with sponsors and mentors, results of sponsorship/mentorship (do they convert into career progression/lateral moves?), impact and ROI of ERGs, engagement and D&I scores, and employee engagement scores by race or gender.

After a detailed investigation of D&I culture has been conducted, you must then figure out where improvements can be made. If, for example, feedback from an engagement survey reveals that several employees feel that the company treats women unfairly, the next steps would be to figure out how to improve this area. To understand how to improve these gaps, it is critical to review the current and past literature on the topic(s). D&I is an area that is growing vastly, and reviewing the research in this domain can help organizations put solutions into practice. Some great resources for D&I information can be found on websites like Harvard Business Review, the Society for Human Resource Management, DiversityInc, and Diversity Best Practices. Reviewing Google Scholar for current research on D&I can also produce a wealth of valuable information.

After you have identified all of the areas of improvement, there must be a consensus regarding how to quantify and measure incremental changes. Will you use retention and attrition rates of different groups as an indication of D&I success in a particular area? How will you measure the effectiveness of a D&I training? It’s always a good idea to gauge where employees are at the beginning to establish a baseline before any sort of intervention is implemented so you can measure their progress throughout the process.

After D&I strategies have been implemented, how will you measure changes along the way? The end destination and goal attainment are central but there should also be a way to evaluate progress at each step along the process. What this does is it allows the organization to assess whether the training is actually working and figure out if modifications and pivots must be made. You must also determine how long a reasonable amount of time is for the intervention. If, for example, your goal is the shift the organizational culture, that can take a long time, maybe even years. Within those years, how will you measure progress and success? Determining how to quantify abstract concepts like a sense of belonging, inclusion and culture shift will allow you to assess incremental changes along the way.

Figuring out how to quantify D&I programs and training will be beneficial when trying to gain leadership buy-in for D&I initiatives. Ultimately, company leaders want to understand the ROI of D&I, which can sometimes be challenging to conceptualize. Numbers and cold hard data are the gateways to gaining buy-in from leadership, who may be skeptical about the effectiveness of D&I programs. Being able to develop D&I metrics and set targets/goals will not only help with buy-in but will also increase the likelihood of achieving diversity goals.",
"Late last week, Prada became the latest company to pull a culturally insensitive product after public outcry.

The luxury brand came under fire after a Facebook post went viral. A woman who walked past the store noticed a display that was reminiscent of blackface imagery, historically been used to denigrate African-Americans. Prada initially issued an apology which many, including myself, thought was inadequate because it lacked emotional intelligence and empathy.

A few days later, the brand issued an updated apology, vowing their commitment to engage in diversity, inclusion, and culture training.

Here's the big lesson every CMO should take from this preventable incident, and others that have proceeded it (see Heineken, H&M and Dove as a reference).

If you look at the comments of the original Facebook post that called attention to the problematic Pradamalia trinkets, they are unfortunately filled with hateful racist comments from people around the world. This is a sad reality. But brands and business leaders have to be held to a higher standard than someone arguing and spreading hate on the internet.

Business is about belonging. And as brands live and operate in a global world with customers of all types of cultures and backgrounds, it isn't enough to say that you value diversity and inclusion, or that you abhor racism. Your actions must support your words. Diversity, inclusion and belonging are not just about slapping on imagery of diverse customers in your photography. It is about understanding and embracing the customers you are serving at a deep level. It's about investing the time to walk a mile in the shoes of customers who don't neatly fit into ""mainstream"" definitions of your customer avatar, so you can better serve them.

And it's about going beyond a superficial understanding of cultures, their histories, and current triggers that impact how they respond to the imagery and narrative that is presented. Customer intimacy is the foundation of good marketing. But you can't have true customer intimacy, especially in a day where most brands have a more diverse customer base than ever before, without cultural intelligence.

Here are three simple ways to add cultural intelligence as a competency within your team

Insist on building a team that adequately represents the customers you are serving. But don't focus solely on filling a quota. That won't get you the results you desire and may cause more harm than good. Instead, focus on building a team where everyone feels like they belong. Create a culture where every voice is valued. Make your team feel comfortable to bring their full selves to work, rather than covering by checking their culture at the door. Build an environment where voices of dissent are welcomed with an intent to learn.

Market research is great and serves a real purpose. Your team can learn a lot through ethnography and other observational methods that help give you a glimpse into the world of the customers you're serving. But the best way to learn any culture is through immersion. That's where the real transformation in your mind and heart happens. Treat your customers like your friends. Strong bonds are often formed through the knowledge and affection you develop for each other by spending time with them.

Hiring consultants and team members who have deep knowledge of your diverse customers is a good idea. But they can't be the only ones who have the cultural intelligence needed to serve your customers. Everyone on the team needs to be proficient.

Consider putting together a professional development curriculum or training program to help your team get up to speed. Going to museums, enrolling in workshops, listening to podcasts, reading books and digesting other content will help connect additional dots for you. This will especially help you capture historical context that informs the state of affairs today.

Building cultural intelligence is an ongoing learning process. You don't have to be perfect on day one or even day 117. But as you work to make the effort to develop a deeper degree with your customers, particularly the ones most people ignore or serve superficially, they will acknowledge your effort. They'll teach you how to engage with them.

And in time, as you treat them like friends who belong with you, they will reward you with their loyalty.",
"One of my daughters knows me cold. Since I'm always on the lookout for great presentations, she created one to convince me to buy an iPhone. I was reluctant at first. By the end of the presentation, I was sold and she got her gift last Christmas.

She's trying again this year and--while I haven't told her yet--it's going to work again. (I hope she doesn't read this article.)

My daughter isn't alone. A New York Times article published on Thursday features this trend. Kids are increasingly using PowerPoint to persuade their parents to buy everything from sneakers to puppies. As a parent and communication expert, I encourage it.

The ability to persuade with a presentation is no longer a ""soft skill."" It's the fundamental skill to stand out and thrive in the knowledge economy.

I spent the better part of a year researching my 2018 book, Five Stars: The Communication Skills to Get from Good to Great. It features first-person accounts of young professionals who start companies, attract investments or get promoted faster because they are better presenters. In the book, I quote TED Talks curator Chris Anderson, who says, ""Presentation literacy isn't an optional extra for the few. It's a core skill for the twenty-first century.""

I agree. Students need to learn to give compelling presentations as early as grade school. In a world where a person's value is locked up in their ideas, those who can present their ideas clearly and convincingly have a competitive advantage.

During my research, I was in in touch with a school in North Palm Beach, Florida, called The Benjamin School. The school's mission is to transform students into independent, collaborative and 'fearless' learners. Fearlessness requires overcoming the fear of public speaking.

The school puts on a TEDx event, an independent, locally organized event associated with the global TED conference. In one presentation, a 12-year-old student named Alexa used a four-minute presentation to explain how Aristotle's theory of persuasion convinced her parents to buy her a puppy.

I was intrigued because I often cite Aristotle's three-part formula as a model for presentations. Aristotle suggested that all persuasive arguments must contain ethos (ethics and character), logos (a logical structure), and ethos (emotion).

""For Logos, I appealed to science. I used compelling evidence such as: 'Mom, a puppy will lower your blood pressure in stressful situations...for Ethos, I told them how a puppy would make us good and noble people. Finally, I used pathos. For this, I needed my little sister. She came in with a stuffed animal that resembled a Goldendoodle. She gave my mom a face she couldn't resist.""

Alexa, the 12-year-old Benjamin School student, ended her presentation with this piece of advice: ""Persuasion is an art that everyone should try and master. It'll be worth it."" I can't say it better myself. It will be worth it, so give your kids a head start.",
"The end of the year is a perfect time to rest and reflect, and evidently, it's also a great time to look for a new job.

Monster's 2018 Year in Jobs Report revealed that the busiest month for job searches happens in January. In fact, eight of the ten top trafficking days fell in the first month of the year.

Although the report didn't specify, I think the spike in job search activity can be attributed to a combination of things that happen at the end of the year -- and, they can be an excellent opportunity for those considering a new job, or for those looking to keep their employees from leaving proactively.

In December, most organizations are winding down in preparation for the holiday break. With the onslaught of vacation requests, plant shutdowns, and out of office replies, most companies hold off on hiring in the month of December.

Instead, they take the time to reforecast hiring needs, establish budgets, and market their most critical roles for the new year. Also, with most employees coming off the holiday break, January is one of the best months to schedule interviews due to hiring managers taking less time off.

By the fourth quarter, any employee who is contemplating a job change will likely endure the rest of the year to ensure they collect their annual bonus. With many companies paying out extra incentives around the holiday, employees won't start their job search until they know the check has cleared the bank.

3. New Year's resolutions come to pass.

Then, there's the psychological process we all go through at the end of the year. With the extra time for reflection comes thoughts of turning over a new leaf and reinventing yourself. With our jobs being such a big part of who we are, it is often the first place our minds go when reevaluating our happiness and goals.

If not, your family and friends are sure to make work top-of-mind. With every party, there is sure to come a lot of questions about work, how things are going, and whether or not you're happy.

If you're considering a new career or wanting to proactively ensure your employees are not part of the holiday job shopping, now is the time to act.",
"It’s a time-honored tradition at the end of year to make lists of our new year’s resolutions – of all the ways we’re planning on bettering ourselves in the upcoming year.   But then, of course, despite the best of intentions, our aspirations often slip, and we don’t necessarily achieve all of our self-improvement goals.

So it got me thinking. In addition to creating a list of our ambitions and resolutions, how about a list of our typical New Year’s stumbling blocks: the things that typically hold us back from reaching our self-improvement goals.

Here’s my top three list.  I’ll be curious to see how it compares to yours.

Stumbling block one.  Substituting an easier task for the task you really should be doing.  You know you really should go to that networking event to meet people, but you decide to send out LinkedIn invitations instead.  Your gut tells you it would be the perfect time to actually stand up and give an old-fashioned speech to your team – to rally the troops… but you happen to hate public speaking. And so you send a nice email instead.  These examples are all avoiding by substituting.  And they hold you back from achieving your true goals by avoiding what you fear by substituting with something easier – but, ultimately, far less effective.

Stumbling block two.  Kicking the can down the road through perfectionist procrastination. Your new idea could be just what the market needs –and this would be a perfect time to get real feedback from real people… but you tell yourself you just need to work out the kinks a bit more – and optimize just a few more elements of the ideas to make it “perfect.” But at the same time – right down the street, your competition speeds their beta version to market, gets critical early feedback, and ultimately produces product that meets the mark in terms of what customers really need.  And you?  You’re left twiddling your thumbs and perfecting something that will never actually see the light of day.

Stumbling block three. Justifying your way out of giving something a try.  It’s OK, you tell yourself, not to go to that professional conference that you know deep down would be key for your career.  Or: It's not that important to give critical feedback to a difficult colleague you know will not take it well.   He'll probably find some other way of getting the information. These are examples of justifications -- of rationalizing yourself out of something you truly don't want to do.  And chances are, if you're anything like the rest of us, you justify your way out of important, but unpleasant tasks on a regular basis.

So these are my top three stumbling blocks: substitution, procrastination and justification.  Any of them ring true? What are your top avoidance strategies?  And, most importantly, what are you going to do about conquering these barriers to personal growth in the new year?",
"If you're like every other head of a business right now, you're looking for top  talent. And it's hard to find. Unemployment is 3.7 percent nationally. In New York City it's 4.3 percent, and in San Francisco it's an incredible 2.2 percent. You're doing everything you can think of to attract great candidates, but it's an uphill climb.

So what if I told you there was a pool of talent out there just waiting to be tapped? They're educated, experienced, and ready to work hard. They might be sending you resumes, but they're getting screened out because of long employment gaps. Or they're afraid to apply in the first place because of those gaps. Or maybe they just don't know how to find you.

I'm talking about older women, Generation Xers in their 40s and 50s, who may have downsized their careers or left the workplace entirely for several years to raise families. This group is unlike any older women we've known before. Unlike their mothers and grandmothers, this is a generation of women with advanced degrees and work experience. Many of them put off families until they were well-established in their careers. They know how to work.

Besides the obvious benefits of hiring diverse talent, Generation X women are a demographic inevitability. Another 10,000 Baby Boomers hit retirement age every day, and the giant millennial generation is already a third of the workforce. Generation X, and women in particular, may soon be among the only workers available.

But how do you find these non-traditional candidates? Start by looking long and hard at your own biases around age and hiring. What assumptions are you or your teams making? Just as with race and gender, attitudes about age make up the culture of a workplace. And just as with other types of diversity, teams that are inter-generationally diverse are more effective and innovative. Continually work on creating a more inclusive, welcoming culture.

Learn more about the methodology you, or your recruiting partners, are using to screen resumes. Take a look through the ones you reject and see if there's an inherent bias for age or career interruptions. Your algorithms could be missing a lot of potentially great candidates.

Remember that women are less likely than men to apply for positions if they don't think they meet every requirement - this is even more true of older women. So watch how you present your job descriptions. Hire for motivation not experience. Individual skills can be taught, but integrity is built in.

Consider sponsoring events with organizations that reach older women workers. Or start your own returnship program. Try different things, but whatever you do, get started. Some of your best employees are out there waiting to be found.",
"As a business development professional, you and your team are constantly seeking new leads. It's easy to hit ""send"" on a cold sales email, but it's what you do next — particularly during a meeting with your new prospect — that determines whether you'll successfully make the sale.

The ""hard sell"" approach doesn't always work; instead, you can craft a pitch that tells a story with your potential customer at the heart of it. You can engage that person and make your product or service the obvious solution to their needs. Here's how the experts of Forbes Business Development Council advise conducting your sales meeting to make sure you close the deal.

Effective account-based marketing (ABM) to drive awareness, consideration and eventual purchase is incredibly important in today's sales process. With information available at the fingertips of any buyer, being able to connect to individuals on a personalized-need basis can be one of the main factors in driving conversions. - Lisa Box, WP Engine, Inc.

2. Be Transparent And Set Expectations Up Front

Customers want transparency and trust in the companies and the people they purchase from. The key to closing sales is to be open about why you feel that your solution or product is best for the client's needs and to openly share the pros and potential cons to purchasing. Sharing the good with the bad creates trust. Partnerships aren't perfect, and a prospect will appreciate the candor. - Jen Tadin, Gallagher

3. Listen To Their Needs

Listening to the prospective customer is key. You can ask questions to engage the customer. However, truly listening to the answers and then being honest about how you can help is most effective for me. I explain what we can offer and then give the customer time to consider. I often say, ""If you decide not to use us, please keep us in mind if there is an opportunity in the future."" - Elizabeth Pritchett, Center Point Business Solutions

It’s necessary to understand that the payoff, in the end, is much higher when proper patience and time is invested to establish strong relationships and trust with prospective clients (versus just going in for the quick sale). I’ve found that one of the most effective strategies for engaging customers is providing our new prospects with customized live demonstrations of our platform. - Shailendra Singh, MarketsandMarkets

Nobody wants to be sold on or cares about our features or functionality. The only thing that matters is our buyer's perception of the value our product and service bring to resolving their business issues. We succeed by becoming problem-solvers and instilling confidence that our value proposition matches their vision of the future. Closing is not an action. It is the end result of a valuable process. - Sasha Poljak, Ximble (Nimble Software Systems, Inc)

I have a much easier time closing than I do engaging. Closing requires a consultative partnership in which the client seeks me to work through all of their options with them and advise them on the best overall option (even if it is not what I'm selling). The trust in this process creates effective closing options. - Julian Searle, Riverwood Capital

Oftentimes, the prospect will love your product (and you) but will still not buy because they could not secure internal buy-in. This is often because they did not have the time or interest to create a thought-out and strategic plan that fully captures the value of your product in a way that will motivate stakeholders. Do this step for your prospect, and it could cut your deal cycle down. - Cortez Armond, Firsthand Inc

I've found that exhibiting exceptional knowledge of your product and how it fits into the broader context of your industry inspires confidence in your prospects and makes them more likely to work with you. Solid product knowledge provides your sales team with a strong foundation that can be applied to various sales frameworks, such as SPIN, Challenger, and Solution sales. - Kabir Mathur, Kiip

Salespeople worry they are giving away the cow. I’ve learned thinking that way is ridiculous, especially today. Customers come in more informed than ever before. I teach my clients to “give, give, give” on every call. I want my prospects to be overloaded with content. I’ll send them free products because I know it helps them, and I trust it will lead to more closes. - Don Markland, MoneySolver

10. Place All The Focus On The Buyer

Sales forces can get too focused on what they are doing. We implement sales processes, provide sales training, manage seller activity, and then measure our own effort or success. Unfortunately, these activities ignore the most important determinant of sales success — the customer. Obsess over the buyer's needs and processes instead, then measure their success. - Jason Jordan, Vantage Point Performance",
"Stress, shame, fear, worry, anxiety -- these are nasty emotions no person wants to experience, yet every year, as families gather over the Christmas holiday, bam! Here we go again...

If you're just tired of getting caught in the old cycle of drama -- facing your critical in-laws that question your lifestyle, or the ever-judgmental aunt Sue whose expectations you will never measure up to -- view this time of year as a great opportunity to raise your emotional awareness and learn to cope better.

After all, relatives gathered around the dinner table to take pot shots at you won't change; it's you who needs to change to better respond (not react) to their insanity so you can keep your sanity.

Don't deny your feelings--they are legitimate and they don't make you weak or broken. Embrace those feelings of doom that may surface before facing the prickly relatives on Christmas day--it is what it is. Rise above it all by showing up with who you truly are--in all your imperfect glory. By being 100 percent authentic with your valies and beliefs, and responding to awkward questions and criticism with a peaceful and confident demeanor, they'll eventually back down and slowly disappear.

2. Accept that you can't control everything.

Many times, your worries during the holidays are a direct result of the fact that you're not in control of everything, especially your family members. The things that are in your control -- your own emotions and how you respond--you can manage just fine. As you prepare to face the family, take one thing at a time, practice mindfulness, be present with your feelings, and focus on what's immediately in front of you.

It's a stressful time of year but it's also a time for celebration. Why not start pursuing activities that bring you peace and joy, and that put bounce back in your step? If you have to expose yourself to the stress of interacting with people who could care less about you, balance that with taking good care of the person your spouse, children, and good friends admire the most -- you! What is it that you love to do? What are some hobbies that have been buried for years? How about that exercise routine you've been neglecting?

If you're feeling anxious about the people in the room or the conversations evolving, simply move. Literally move -- go outside and get some fresh air. Put on your earbuds and start listening to your favorite relaxing music while going for a brisk walk. Try to take your mind away from what's bothering you. As you breathe in the crisp winter air, focus on positive thoughts that will make you feel safe, accepted, loved, and honored.

President Franklin D. Roosevelt famously said, ""The only thing we have to fear is fear itself."" Fear is what paralyzes you before an impending event you're dreading--like having to face that side of the family again. But after you pull it off, even though they're annoying as heck and their personalities don't mesh with yours, you realize you're not in danger and the in-laws didn't break your knee caps with a baseball bat. Thus, training your brain to accept that there's no threat (besides that veggie meat tearing up your stomach) will help you to switch off the fear response. You'll soon realize that it's the fear of fear that you fear, and nothing else. And that will eventually become easy to manage when you face the family next time .",None
"Every year, for at least one month out of the year, I'll pack my bags and travel to Thailand to vacation with my family while working remotely. You might call it a ""work-cation"".

There are of course a lot of great things about living on a beach island where it's 90 degrees every day, while everyone else is (hopefully) freezing. However, it's not always as easy and fun as it sounds.

1. You need a daily work routine more than ever.

I thought I could easily just ""work whenever"" I wanted because I was remote, but I found out quickly that not having a daily schedule was a real bad idea. I found myself disorganized, stressed out and I found my clients more unhappy than ever because I wasn't getting the same level of work I am used to delivering

Here's the thing about working remotely with a family. You're working & on vacation at the same time. Your family, however, is on vacation. So, while they definitely respect that you're working, they're also expecting to do vacation things.

Without setting expectations on when you can do things with the family, you're setting yourself up for a bad time. Let them know when you're free to do activities with them. Of course, many activities require a full day and not just a few hours here and there. Be diligent about this when building your schedule.

3. Communicate twice as much as you used to.

The best part about getting away is that you're away from everyone else. You feel like you can be more productive because you're not dealing with everyone else's stressors. The hard part about getting away is that your clients and colleagues think you're out having fun and think you're not working. This stresses them out, which then turns out stressing you out. The same goes for your family. Over-communicate what your plans are and when you're going to be doing fun things and times where you'll be working.

4. Find a location that has activities that can be done without you (if needed).

Working remotely while on vacation can either sound like heaven to you or a miserable time. Since I go for at least a month at a time, I can't just shut off. The city I chose within Thailand is Phuket. It's family and tourist-friendly and generally a safe city. This means that not every activity needs me to be present.

Of course, I would like to be present in most of the activities, but if I have to jump on a last minute conference call or do work, I'm happy that my wife can just take the kids and do the things we had planned on doing instead of waiting for me to get off the call.

5. Cafe's with fast internet are your friend.

Plus hotels don't really care if you have fast internet or not. They just care that you have internet some of the times. And when you're trying to join a conference call, and your clients can't hear you because the connection is bad, that's bad for everyone involved.",
"I have three young boys: ages 9, 6, and 4. We live abroad, in Indonesia, where kids play mostly outdoors with balls and sand toys, rather than plastic and electronics. Each year, we come to the U.S. for Christmas to visit two adoring sets of grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins. But this visit also comes with an extraordinary amount of advertising aimed at kids about what toys they need to have, an absolute fascination with Target (mine), and, generally, being overwhelmed with all the ""stuff"" we're suddenly faced with being prompted to purchase.

My husband and I are entrepreneurs, and one of our goals as a family is to raise kids who have the imagination, creativity, and space to think so they can create the world in their image.

Too many gifts--too many toys, in general--can stifle entrepreneurial habits in kids

Is it possible that these two parts of life--the desire to raise entrepreneurially minded kids and the desire to bask in the spirit of Christmas gift giving--are actually incongruent? Research by the University of Toledo would suggest so. This November 2017 study uncovered information that proves, scientifically, that the more toys a kid has, the less creative, resourceful, and focused he or she is--which are all traits that fully align with entrepreneurial thinking.

The University of Toledo study observed 36 children, 18 to 30 months old, as they played in a room with four toys versus a room with 16 toys. Here's what they found:

Use frameworks to help limit and control the number of gifts your children receive

How do you make sure you're encouraging imagination, creativity, and focus, while still participating in the gift-giving season? Use a specific framework to limit gift giving itself. Here are a few examples:

And, if all else fails, two other ideas might do the trick: Rotate toys (take half of the toys and box them up, and switch them in and out); or get the kids involved by donating (ideally) or selling their toys.

While it might seem difficult to turn the tide on what can feel like overwhelming pressure to fill your living room with lots of beeps and buzzes from electronic toys, as well as dozens of Amazon boxes, the holidays are actually the perfect time to reframe the spirit of Christmas and help your children reconsider their attitudes and expectations about this time of year.",
"With computers hacked & no gifts by the tree,

Santa is on his way! With Black Friday and Cyber Monday over, you’re now on the hunt for the best Christmas deals. Well unfortunately, the hunter becomes the hunted! In the rush from one store to the next, it’s easy to become distracted, frantically opening emails from your smartphone, searching for that last-minute deal from your favourite store. Many shoppers choose to beat holiday crowds by purchasing gifts online but as online sales boom, so do cyber attacks.

(In the event of Santa utilising artificial intelligence, blockchain and cyber security to enhance Lapland's operations, could the rate of cybercrime increase or decrease? Take a look at my Christmas article: Tech-Savvy Santa Relies on AI, Blockchain & Cyber Security).

According to Deloitte’s annual retail holiday sales forecast, there is expected to be up to a 22% jump in online sales compared to last year.  Additionally, online sales are expected to reach up to approximately £100 billion during the holiday season.

With so many of us shopping online, we open ourselves to phishing attacks, spam email, malicious websites, viruses and other cyber attacks fighting to enter our chimney (account), aiming to steal our money and/or information.

The cyber criminals will most likely be impersonating retailers, couriers, and payment services.

It’s common for a cybercriminal to use emails to gain access to your financial or personal information.  Criminals will send a phishing email, within which they will copy a retailer’s sale or discount email, and include a link to a false portal/website, requesting that you enter your information.  The criminals are relying on your unquestioning trust!  Sometimes you can spot these phishing emails by the strange email address, spelling errors, or incorrect grammar contained.  Additionally, a reputable organisation will never request for your personal or financial information by email.

You may also be sent fake notifications, referring to a payment failure, tracking number, supposed refund, fake voucher or coupons.

What could happen if you ignore this article, and click on a phishing link or download an attachment?  Well, you may install malware, such as a virus, spyware, or ransomware on your device.  This is typically done without you realising it's actually happening.  Once installed, it may:

In the unfortunate event of clicking on a phishing link or downloading an attachment, you should consider taking the following actions:

In reducing our risk to cybercrime over Christmas, the following additional actions are important for us all to follow — whether we have responded to a phishing email, or not:

Christmas is a season to be jolly, but also a season to be aware of cybercrime!  Our exposure to cyber attacks is heightened and we must be mindful to protect ourselves and our devices while shopping.

"The Producers Guild of America (PGA) has announced that producer/actress Jane Fonda will be honored with the Guild’s 2019 Stanley Kramer Award.

Fonda is being recognized for her lifetime activism and philanthropic work, and will receive the award at the 30th Annual Producers Guild Awards presented by Cadillac on January 19, 2019 at The Beverly Hilton hotel in Los Angeles.

Established in 2002, the award honors a production, producer or other individuals whose achievement or contribution illuminates and raises public awareness of important social issues.

A two-time Academy Award® winner, Fonda is known equally for her achievements in entertainment and for her prolific work in support of many political and social causes.

Among them are her nonprofit, the Georgia Campaign for Adolescent Power & Potential, which raises funds to lower the teen pregnancy rate and improve the overall health and well-being of young people in the state of Georgia.In December of 2017, Fonda celebrated her 80th birthday by by raising $1.3 million for the initiative.

In the same month, she raised nearly $1 million for the Women’s Media Center, a nonprofit she co-founded with Gloria Steinem and Robin Morgan, whose mission is to make women and girls more visible and powerful in media.

Earlier this year, Fonda starred in the summer box office hit, Book Club; and was the subject of the critically-acclaimed HBO documentary, Jane Fonda in Five Acts, chronicling her life and her activism. Next month, the fifth season of Grace and Frankie, the Netflix comedy series that she executive produces and stars in, will debut.

Said PGA Presidents Gail Berman and Lucy Fisher about Fonda receiving the award, “Jane Fonda has built an extraordinary legacy as an outspoken advocate for the vulnerable in our society. Throughout her remarkable life, she has made, and continues to make, a significant impact on the lives of people through her work both on and off the screen. Fonda exemplifies the spirit of Stanley Kramer, and we are proud to honor her.”

Previous recipients of the Stanley Kramer Award include the films: Get Out, The Normal Heart, Fruitvale Station, and Hotel Rwanda. Sean Penn is the only other individual to receive the award. He was honored in 2010.

The award is named for producer/director Stanley Kramer, the celebrated filmmaker who wove progressive social themes into his films and made a positive cultural impact on the audiences of his time. He created some of the most powerful works in the history of American motion pictures, including such classics as Inherit the Wind, On the Beach, The Defiant Ones, and Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner.

The Stanley Kramer Award is determined by a nine-person committee appointed by the PGA’s National Board of Directors and operates independently of the Producers Guild Awards team and the PGA staff",
"I'm always striving to bring creators front and center in this column. I want originators to have the platform that advertising has owned. I want creators, designers, and inventors to be the ones, not in the shadows, but in the showcase. And not only that, I want to highlight the founders who are bringing it, with new platforms that will help make this happen. Point in case: Absolut Art, and the source, CEO Nahema Mehta.

But First: A History Lesson on Vodka

Art is in Absolut's DNA. In 1986, Andy Warhol became enamored of the Swedish brand's apothecary-inspired bottle, declaring: ""I love the design. I want to do something with it."" Absolut asked the artist to design an image of the bottle; the resulting ""Absolut Warhol"" advertising campaign was a smashing success. The company asked Warhol to suggest other artists, resulting in a proud legacy and connection with art that most don't even know exists.

Over the thirty years since then, some six hundred more artists, including Louise Bourgeois, Keith Haring, Damien Hirst, Dr. Lakra, and Hank Willis Thomas, have all joined the Absolut family. Did I mention this is Absolut, as in Absolut vodka? Side note: Consumer testing on the specific shape and design of the  Absolut bottle, before it released, came back so negative they thought none of the bottles would even sell.

One Source, Another Bragging Right

When I did a little more research into Absolut's mission and philosophy, I wasn't surprised to see that their vodka production is dedicated to quality and respecting the world they serve. Their 'One Source' philosophy means that every drop of water and every seed of wheat comes from one water source, one village and one community. No, this isn't an ad for Absolut. But it definitely is a bump for a business doing the right things when so many choose not to.

Absolut Art is on a mission to make art as easy to consume as music. Mehta explained to me the issues and reasons behind why art isn't mainstream and easy to consume.

When Was the Last Time You Took Artwork Home?

When was the last time you saw a piece, loved it so much, knew how to purchase it, and took it home? Most people are introduced to an artist or an ""art world"" and that is how they buy, or learn the process. This kind of obscure process is what they are attempting to correct, a mission I can really stand behind. Having a mother who is a fine artist, and being in design myself, allows me a backdoor view of this process for plenty of artists, and it certainly is ripe for innovation.

After reviewing their service, I wanted to point out a few of the perks I noticed, as opposed to more old school styles of purchasing art. These perks are important because, ultimately, it helps connect more artists and creators to more consumers, something you know I am passionate about.

The separation we see between artists and consumers has undoubtedly lent to the ""starving artist"" persona that's become so popular. It shouldn't be so difficult to find art you love and hang it in your home... and thanks to Mehta and Absolut Art, that's finally changing. As she so wisely points out, 2019 is a year for more intention, and to purposefully invest in things we care about.",

"At the start of December, I chaired a PropTech event for Women in Property. Five game-changing startups presented their disruptive solutions for the CRE space to a rapt audience. Needless to say, I had to cut questions short, every time! However, I made sure to ask each speaker one key thing.

Looking back at 2018, what are the key takeaways with regards to tech advancement in your area of expertise and what are the opportunities for 2019?

The answers I got were as diverse as the startups giving them, but some key themes emerged throughout. Here are the thoughts on 2018 and predictions for 2019 from five PropTech game changers.

It is clear that 2018 marked a fundamental shift in the sentiment for tech amongst real estate players. Though implementation in many cases has not matched up, this is on course to happen in 2019.

Hannah Prideaux, business development director at District Technologies, which delivers a smart building app enabling landlords and large occupiers to create seamless and unique building experiences for their end users, concurs. She told me that, “Though there have been a lot of tech advancements in 2018, the real change has been in terms of the mindset”. In her role as BD director, Prideauxspeaks to multiple stakeholders in the space, from landlords to occupiers to investors, and sentiment has been rapidly shifting in favor of PropTech amongst these real estate stakeholders, particularly in recent months. One of the interesting changes she has seen is that new roles are being created within traditional property firms that reflect this change in mindset, such as ‘wellness leads’ or ‘customer experience managers’.

Olly Freedman, UK sales director at Datscha, a platform which reveals the ultimate owners of commercial property through comprehensive data sources, pointed out that when he started at the firm in 2014 (a year and a half before it went live in the UK) nobody had even heard of proptech, let alone Datscha! Since then, sentiment has shifted, but the biggest change has been so far this year, and it can only be expected to escalate.

Dr. Chlump Chatkupt, the founder of Placemake.io, is a mathematician and deep tech expert who built an Artificial Intelligence (AI) platform which has been described as the ‘Google for location and mobility’. According to Chatkupt, “New algorithms (such as capsule networks), improved hardware, greater computational power, and more data have led to significant advances in AI. At the same time, enterprises have begun to operationalize AI and integrate it into core processes, such as warehouse automation.” Another big breakthrough for 2018 is the transport revolution driven not just by ride-sharing but by autonomous vehicles, micro transit, and other last-mile transport modes that will transform the real estate and retail industries, redefine urban boundaries, upend pricing dynamics, and alter our definition of prime real estate.

Peter Bredthauer, co-founder of Proda, which owns a machine learning driven software for the standardization of excel based real estate data, told me that, “At Proda, we have talked to a lot of companies throughout 2018, and they are all aware that they need to utilize tech. Some have already started implementing a strategy, whilst others are still scouting the market. Implementation will continue to grow in 2019, with more companies formalizing their strategy and starting to really integrate new technologies into their workflows.”

AI and machine learning are the standout winners of the ‘tech to watch in 2019’ prize.

The starting point for these ‘deep’ technologies is, of course, data. As Bredthauer pointed out, “This year’s KPMG Global PropTech survey identified data and automation as the areas expected to generate the most change in the property industry”, which is where Proda is positioning itself.

Michael Romero, UK country manager for Dalux, a construction tech platform that digitalizes the process all the way from design through to facilities management, told me that after their 2018 release of an augmented reality, mobile-based BIM viewer, they are working on robotics and drone programs to execute site scans more precisely and efficiently in 2019. Dalux’s mobile-based platform will allow for exponential growth in usage in the coming year, as in construction it’s all about solutions that are easy to use on site.

Quoting celebrated AI scientist Andrew Ng, Chatkupt observed that, “AI is the new electricity.” He believes that AI will become increasingly foundational, transformative, and pervasive, and recommends that PropTech firms and their clients adopt an ‘AI first’ attitude, thinking of it as fundamental rather than supplemental and promoting data sharing and strategic partnerships in the field. He cautioned that we are underestimating the rate of change in AI, which will bring accelerating returns to those who are effectively leveraging it and will create an ever-widening gap for those who fail to take advantage of this technology. Chatkuptechoed Bredthauerin saying that the biggest problem in the field of AI – and therefore in the advancement of real estate technologies - is lack of standardization and opaqueness of data. As a consequence, progress in this space will be defined more by cooperation and collaboration than by competition between stakeholders.

In a predictions piece for Property Week last year, I wrote that 2018 would be the year PropTech comes of age. It is evident that, though we may have reached that mark in terms of awareness, we will have to look to 2019 and beyond to witness the real estate industry really putting its money where its mouth is in terms of implementation. Data will continue to be key, and the creation of a common data standard as recommended by the BPF can make a crucial difference to deep tech innovation in real estate. This is particularly important as deep technologies such as AI will be those that deliver an exponential value-add that could cause a seismic shift in the way the industry operates. Bring on 2019!",
"While still an essential marketing channel for brands of all kinds, it's no secret that email marketing has become a much tougher nut to crack since its inception. With open rates dipping below 25 percent across the board, spam filters becoming more sophisticated and privacy laws continuing to pile on, alternatives to email marketing are looking more enticing than ever before.

One promising opportunity that's often overlooked is SMS marketing, or text message marketing. Here are the reasons why SMS marketing could be the medium that takes your brand to new heights in 2019, how to get started and some best practices to ensure you're using the channel most effectively.

People are always connected to their phones.

We live in a mobile-first world where people of all ages are increasingly becoming glued to their smartphones. In fact, it's been recorded that, on average, people check their phones a whopping 80 times per day. As a result, it's no wonder why open rates for SMS marketing typically hover around 82 percent. This makes sending texts to customers and members of your brand's community the closest thing to being absolutely certain your content won't get overlooked.

Additionally, unless the medium becomes saturated with every brand on the planet, it's unlikely this trend will change anytime soon given how mobile-centric contemporary culture has become.

Lastly, when taking a look at how often people change their social media profiles, email addresses and more, phone numbers are certainly updated the least. This essentially guarantees your SMS marketing will have longevity, something that can't always be said about alternative marketing channels.

1. Get the right software.

There are loads of mobile marketing platforms out there, but two of the best -- based both on how long they've been in business, reviews and quality of their features -- are Textedly and Avochato. Take some time to browse through other options though to see which product best fits your organization's particular needs.

The next step is to begin collecting customer's phone numbers. In the same way you try to snag the email addresses of website visitors and prospects, you need to begin collecting phone numbers as well. You can get started by inserting a field in all your company's opt-in forms that asks for a prospect's phone number.

You can also run social media ads on Facebook, Twitter and beyond which asks viewers to opt-in through mobile for a discount, for entry into a contest or something similar. Lastly, you can also beef up your phone number list by giving away free content, such as a webinar or ebook, in exchange for their contact information. This tactic has proven fruitful for collecting email addresses, and the same can be done for phone numbers.

3. Make 100 percent sure you have the user's permission to text them.

Be absolutely sure you have a person's explicit permission to use their phone number for promotional purposes. Not only is it the right thing to do from an ethical perspective, it'll also make sure you're not breaking the law. On top of that, be sure all your text messages used for marketing purposes have an unsubscribe option.

Don't exploit access to a person's phone number. Be mindful of how personal and private a text message is, and act accordingly. Only send text messages when absolutely necessary. If you spam your list with a massive amount of messages, they'll quickly get annoyed, unsubscribe and lose trust in your brand as a whole.

5. Know the limits of text messaging.

There are a couple limits of SMS marketing to keep in mind. For one, you have to keep your character count to a minimum, so maintaining your brand voice or telling a compelling story is difficult. Also, you can't alert your audience as frequently as you can on social media for the reasons listed above.",
"If you have an upcoming job interview, hopefully you have prepared thoroughly and reviewed common interview mistakes you now know to avoid. However, you can’t predict every scenario, and you still might get a curveball question you didn’t expect. Or the interviewer may probe a difficult time in your career that puts you in a negative frame of mind. Or, you are asked a fair question but your mind goes blank.

How to recover when you are stumped by a job interview question depends on what the question is and why you get rattled. Here are three common scenarios that stymie even the most prepared job seeker and strategies to bounce back if you do get a question that throws you:

Scenario 1: You get an odd, confusing, or even nonsensical curveball question

The fix:  Emphasize your message, not your answer

Let’s say you’re in an interview for a marketing role. You’re expecting the interviewer to ask about your last marketing job or perhaps one of the projects detailed on your resume. Then the interviewer asks: If you were a car, what model would you be?

While the job interview typically unfolds as question then answer, your ultimate goal is not to have the right answers, but rather to have a powerful message overall about your value to that employer. This message includes key skills, experience and expertise that are relevant to this employer. Ideally, you have reviewed your past marketing experience and have already identified examples of specific marketing projects with tangible results that are relevant to this employer. This is the message that you focus on, regardless of any specific question, especially a nonsensical one.

Interviewer: If you were a car, what model would you be?

You: Well, most of my projects have been about opening new markets. I get called in to do the preliminary research, outline our on-the-ground campaign, and identify our key customers. So I’m the go-to person to get things going…much like the engine of car. So I suppose I would be a sports car or racing car or a muscle car.

If instead you started thinking of cars (and what if you’re not a car afficionado???), you may get stumped. But if you always think first of your message, which you have prepared in advance and which you know very well, then you can start with what you know, buy yourself some time, and adapt your message to any question. Most importantly, you keep the interview focused on what matters (i.e., what you can contribute), and you make the case for why you’re a good hire, regardless of whether the interviewer asks helpful questions or not .

Scenario 2: You are asked about a difficult, unsettling or negative time in your career

Even talented and hard-working professionals encounter low points in their career – e.g., fired from a job, unemployed longer than expected. Or maybe there is a past job you held that you really didn’t like, and it’s hard for you to discuss it unemotionally. Whatever the hot button is in your background, if it appears on your resume, it may come up in the interview.

Ideally, you should practice talking about the difficult points in your career in advance until you can speak about them in a neutral voice , without sounding negative (e.g., resentful, blaming, defensive). If you didn’t practice, or if you tried to get to neutral but the question came and you feel yourself still getting rattled, then pick the shortest answer you can and steer the conversation back to something positive.

Interviewer: You were only at Company Scary for six months, what happened?

You: When I joined, the job turned out to be different than I expected so I felt it was best to move on. All my other tenures have been far longer…In my last role at Company Sane, [continue with your message]

Interviewer: Tell me about your least favorite boss.

You: (having flashbacks to a toxic, bullying boss who still gives you anxiety) I have learned something from all of my bosses, so I appreciate all of them….

Interviewer: Seriously, there must be at least one you didn’t like.

You: Well, I do best when I have autonomy and agency in my work, so my least favorite would have to be at Company Scary, where there was more of a micro-managing style. Luckily, my last boss is still a mentor to me…[pivot to something positive].

You always want to answer the question. You don’t want to seem like you’re hiding something or unwilling to share. However, just like in the car example, the point is not the answer, but your overall message. Stay neutral and redirect to a more pleasant subject.

Scenario 3: You get a question that sounds simple, but you blank on the answer

The fix:  Get as close as you can to addressing the question, even if it means following up later

Interviewer: Give me an example of when you used data in a product launch

You: (thinking through your projects – market research, direct mail campaign – no product launch!) BLANK STARE

Ideally, you have reviewed your resume line-by-line so you are prepared to talk about any project you have done. Too many job seekers don’t review the details, and then a question comes up about a specific project, and the answer is a rambling mess or, worse, the blank stare. However, even if you did review in advance and have simply forgotten a product launch example or don’t have a specific product launch example, then simply pivot to the next best thing, something related. In this case, that means having launched anything – perhaps opened a new market or expanded the customer base. Or you focus on how you have used data in your marketing, just not in a product launch specifically. If it turns out that you think of a more relevant example after the interview is over, you can include it in your thank you note.

The best interview unfolds like a conversation, not an interrogation. Most employers care that candidates have a good interview experience because it contributes to a positive overall impression of the company. Therefore, most interviews are collegial and not difficult. However, as you can see from the above, it’s easy to get stumped at an interview even if the interviewer isn’t trying to be difficult. Remember that this is a conversation, not a hostile Q&A. Connect with your interviewer. Stay on message.",None
"Mellody Hobson spoke truth to power at the New York Times Dealbook conference when she excoriated a roomful of Fortune 500 C-level executives for the lack of diversity in their leadership and in that room.  The comments of this highly-successful black female CEO of Ariel Investments were echoed at the conference by Ken Chenault, the highly-respected (now-former) CEO of American Express, who is African-American. He said, ""The fact that we’re in this situation is a real problem and it’s embarrassing for corporate America,” according to The New York Times.

That was November 2017. Now a year later, it’s worse. Women are only 4.8% of the S&P 500 and only 5% of Fortune 500 CEOs, down from 6.4% in 2017 when Hobson and Chenault spoke at Dealbook (Note: Chenault was replaced as CEO by a white man).

What will it take for the Fortune 500 C-level and other senior levels to match the population – and their customer bases?

As Laurence D. Fink, chairman and CEO of the global investment management company BlackRock said at the Dealbook conference, “If we are not a mirror of who our clients are, we’re going to fail.”

Many studies show that companies with more women in leadership perform better financially – by 21% in this McKinsey study – as well as serve customers more effectively and have more reliable governance.  Companies in science, technology, engineering and math fields (STEM), have especially plateaued or regressed when it comes to promoting women into leadership. For example, according to Code.org, a nonprofit dedicated to increasing diversity in computer science, women are only 17.5% of computer science undergraduates, and 22% when you include graduate and Ph.D. graduates.

In an economy that demands companies continuously innovate, which inherently requires diverse ideas and perspectives at the table, it’s urgent that we solve this challenge.

Here are 10 tips that rise to the surface from the hundreds of women I have interviewed for this Forbes blog this year, as well as on my acclaimed podcast, Green Connections Radio, and for my forthcoming book:

I was completely new to the auto and energy sectors when I was recruited by Chrysler to head up the communications of their EV division.  The president of the company said I was hired and so successful at it, precisely because I wasn’t tainted by experience in the industry and had so many creative ideas.

#TimesUp on the excuses for not advancing women to leadership roles at the same rate as men.

As 2018 comes to a close and you plan your company’s strategies for 2019, include an ambitious and creative plan for advancing women, such as, doubling the number of women in leadership by the end of the year.  You can put these tips into action tomorrow in that plan.

Then, let me know how it works out and maybe I’ll write about your success story in the future.",
"How much time do you think the average leader spends interacting with employees and customers? Forty percent?  Fifty percent? A recent study outlined in Harvard Business Review reveals that it’s just 9 percent. Every leader who participated in the study was shocked by this number: They truly believed they were investing far more time in those two important areas.

To help leaders understand where they actually spend their time vs. where they think they spend their time, I’ve created a tool called the Leadership Task Log.

When leaders at Merck Canada used it to track their time, they discovered that the vast majority of it was spent — surprise, surprise — in meetings. Tracking their time helped them realize where their time was going and where it was being wasted. Getting an accurate snapshot of how they spent their workdays enabled them to prioritize their goals and make new commitments.

To get this kind of insight, start by downloading a time-tracker like Simple Time Track, Timesheet, or Klok. Then, for one week in January, track exactly how you spend your time at work. it’s crucial to be precise about your tasks so we’ve broken down the main business areas into these 14 categories:

Remember to also log any time you spend working after-hours or on the weekend. After seven days, add up your totals in each category and then tally your total weekly hours.

From there, you’ll do some simple math to get the percentage of your time spent in each area. For instance, if you spent 16 hours in meetings out of 52 total weekly hours, you’d divide 16 by 52 to get 0.307. Then multiply your sum by 100 to get your percentage of time spent in meetings. (16 hours in meetings  ÷ 52 total weekly hours = 0.307 x 100 = 30.7%)

Once you’ve got a percentage for every category, make an asterisk beside the three that contribute the most value to your role. Armed with your percentages, you can now identify opportunities for change and action. Ask yourself:

Consider moving things forward by committing to one or all of the following intentions:

The Leadership Task Log increases your awareness of daily time-sucks and gives you the hard facts about how you actually spend your workday. You can then make decisions about which of your tasks should be outsourced, delegated, and eliminated so you can spend more time in 2019 on work that matters.",
"If you're in human resources, you're likely a ""people person."" You have the capacity to connect with and help others, which is essential to a job in HR.

While the industry needs that human element, technology is now advancing the field even further, paving a smooth path for current and future workers looking to deliver their best work. We asked a panel of Forbes Human Resources Council members how they want to see their industry leveraging new tech in the near future. Their best answers are below.

Technology is making it easier for HR organizations to integrate workforce data into their decision-making processes. Having better insights to guide succession planning, career mobility, retention strategies, talent acquisition strategies and learning and development programs will increase the effectiveness of human resources. - Candice McGlen, The Rinker Group

Where technology truly lends its edge is in taking out more of the guesswork when hiring new people with the assistance of personality and performance tests, and cross-referencing those responses with data gathered from existing employees, which can then be used to better predict which types of personalities and strengths perform better in which roles. - Angela Nguyen, Ad Exchange Group

The CIO and CTO of a company will focus on all three of these elements to bring IT/technology in the forefront to help with the business objectives. We first have to determine the KPIs, and then define if any of the technology being considered will help you achieve those KPIs. Platforms that help us connect with global resources could transform a business by getting things done fast. - Abhijeet Narvekar, The FerVID Group

In the area of leadership training, there are now companies that use smartphone apps to give leadership development training, and tie employees together on topics to have instant coaching sessions on the topic. The technology in these systems also leans on artificial intelligence that reads the coaching session, and recommends other training courses that the leader may be interested in taking. - Charmaine Smith Winters, Samsung Austin Semiconductor

Effective HR work can be leveraged with new technology to support aligning business priorities to its people strategies. HR can be a strategic, proactive partner in many functional areas, such as talent acquisition, talent management, succession planning and learning and development to effectively support talent development in service of achieving business priorities and organizational goals. - Sherry Martin, OmniTRAX

I'm excited to see how new technologies help augment a recruiter’s ability to find and engage candidates. With the current job market, more and more of recruiting is proactive. Finding great candidates when they aren't actively looking and catering a resume to your job description can be tough, but AI can help. - Steven Jiang, Hiretual

HR has leveraged artificial intelligence to screen high-volume applicant pools, minimize unconscious bias in hiring and upskill workforce talent for succession planning. However, AI should be balanced with ""HI” — human intelligence. This will provide an objective tool that gives humans the data they need to make better decisions, create innovative strategies and resolve complex problems. - Bridgette Wilder, Wilder HR Management & EEO Consulting

Technology that uncovers talent's values and performance in context and at scale allows teams to envision culture fit and creates a strong organization. This also gives HR professionals more tools to work with their teams, instead of solely relying on personality type, categorizations and labels. - Julie Choi, Pointr

Using mobile apps is really exciting for HR departments. Your employees can manage their benefits, healthcare appointments and coverage, payroll operations and expenses, while your HR department can use apps for recruiting, application tracking, employee attendance, time tracking and project management. - Cameron Bishop, SkillPath

Today, the effectiveness of HR rests heavily on the experiences it creates for all business stakeholders. At the same time, transparency of key processes with a feedback loop for continuous improvement is essential. It is exciting to have tech solutions that can aid implementation of people strategies across the entire continuum of HCM, and facilitate shapeshifting business models. - Ekta Vyas, Ph.D, Stanford Children's Health

Technology has the power to create even more touch points for employees to foster world-class service. From mobile onboarding apps where employees consume tailor-made content that creates buzz, to 24/7 chat functionality or integrated performance management tools that improve efficiencies, the technology available today allows HR teams to focus on a seamless end-to-end experience. - Chatelle Lynch, McAfee

I think many of us are most excited to see the industry leverage new tech to reduce human error found within HR operations without having to sacrifice the human element. By automating HR operations, we should expect a reduction in transactional errors, an increase in self-service options, a better fit for candidate matches and bias removed from many components of the HR decision-making process. - Dr. Timothy J. Giardino, Cantata Health, LLC",
"Growing a small business can be difficult. For entrepreneurs just starting out, it can seem as if there are infinite factors that need to be accounted for. But no one can give their full attention to all aspects of a business at all times. As such, it is important to know where to concentrate efforts for maximum positive impact.

With so much on your plate, it may be difficult to know what to focus on. To help, five members of Forbes Boston Business Council share what they think is the most overlooked factor when growing a small business.

An easily overlooked factor in small business growth is doing follow-up on qualified leads that are not in an active sales conversation. It’s common for marketing to focus on attracting new prospects and for sales to focus on live opportunities. Potential but slow-moving leads can fall through the cracks, so be sure to follow through on prospects you have already invested in to attract. – Michael DesRochers, PoliteMail Software

As a startup or a small business, the most important factor to concentrate on is execution and team building. Every company, even the smallest one, has an established culture largely driven by the founders, whether overtly or organically. It’s critical that each and every person hired fits within that company culture and can thrive in it and contribute toward making the business grow. – Rudina Seseri, Glasswing Ventures

Small businesses can be hard to find, and sometimes easy to forget. Out of sight, out of mind. Your pipeline, backlog and ability to execute your current projects are most important. Show some face time to your best clients and prospects. If you make yourself a household name, they'll think of you first. Make personal deliveries when others would ship a box. Be personal, show them you care. – Matteo Forgione, P.E., Forgione Engineering, Inc.

Your lawyer is your first investor. The startup lawyers defer fees, give discounts and ensure startups are poised for success. This is everything from founder equity splits, new hire documents, incorporation or 83(b) filings — miss that and you just lost a potential $10 million in tax-free earnings. – Zoë Barry, ZappRx, Inc.

It's crucial to maintain a focus on your product-market fit: Do your customers desire the product you actually offer? (This is slightly different from ""Can I solve my customer's problem?"") There are many moving parts to a small business and it's difficult to tackle them all evenly, however, maintaining a focus on the product-market fit enables the best opportunity for long-term success. – Dustin Clinard, RISK IDENT",
"You probably focus a lot of time and energy on your business’s brand, but what about your personal brand?

As someone who works in the real estate world, I’m a huge advocate of personal branding. In industries like mine, if you're actively promoting your business online or sharing your expertise with your local following, then you’re already creating a personal brand for yourself. It’s just a matter of keeping it fresh and interesting so that your audience doesn’t get bored or tired of you.

When done right, personal branding can be one of the best ways to get in front of new customers, keep your current customers engaged and, ultimately, grow your business. Here are a four creative tactics to take your personal brand to the next level in 2019.

One of my key pieces of advice for anyone seeking new business opportunities is to start a blog. When I started blogging, I had no idea how much it could help me promote all of the other aspects of my business. Having a blog served as a great way to give my audience a behind-the-scenes look at my business and share my expertise.

Whether you decide to blog once per week or once a month, it’s important to have a schedule and be consistent. If you’re new to personal blogging, here are a few platforms to consider:

• Medium: Medium is a great place to share long-form posts. Built-in social sharing features and a large, active community make this one of my favorite personal blogging platforms.

• Squarespace: Squarespace is a great option for a professional-looking blog that can be highly customized without any coding knowledge. Though Squarespace can be more expensive than some other options, you can use your own domain name and branding.

• Instagram and LinkedIn: Though Instagram and LinkedIn aren't traditional blogging platforms, many people are taking advantage of their generous caption and post character limits to microblog. You also can use LinkedIn’s native publishing platform. Built-in social sharing, tagging and multimedia features make microblogging on social media sites like these a popular alternative to the traditional website blog.

Podcasting is one of the most popular ways to build a personal brand right now. Research shows that 26% of people in the United States now listen to podcasts monthly (up from 24% in 2017), and the average listener tunes in to seven different podcasts each week.

Many entrepreneurs have turned to podcasting to strengthen their personal brands. For instance, best-selling author and entrepreneur Tim Ferriss hosts ""The Tim Ferriss Show"" to share insights on his life and thought-provoking interviews with guests from around the world.

Nowadays, setting up a podcast can be relatively inexpensive, and there are countless ways to distribute and promote your show. If you’re new to the world of podcasting, listen to a few of the most popular shows in your industry to get an idea of the format and types of content they share. Consistency is important if you’re going to see any valuable results from your efforts. Decide on the number of episodes you want to record, and set up a recording schedule before you even begin. This will help you stick to a schedule that your audience can depend on, rather than randomly recording and releasing one episode at a time.

In my experience, most business newsletters can be annoying and too promotional. A personal newsletter is an opportunity to be less formal and more intimate. With a personal newsletter, you can share your expertise or industry insights with your audience on a regular basis and develop more personal relationships with them.

Rather than using a generic business email address, you should send your personal newsletter from an address that includes your name. Readers will begin to recognize who the emails are from and may be more compelled to open them if you’ve already captured their attention elsewhere.

We can’t talk about personal branding today without mentioning the stories format on social media. Stories have become very popular outlets for individuals to create and share content with their followers on the go. Entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk is a perfect example of how to use stories to grow a massive personal brand.

My favorite place to create stories for your personal brand is Instagram. Two Instagram Stories features that can help boost your personal brand include:

• Questions and polls: Ask your audience questions or poll them through your stories to gather their responses right away. Whether it’s a question about the type of content your audience wants to see from you or a trending local topic, using questions and polls is a great way to drive engagement.

• Content links: The swiping feature allows your viewers to swipe any photos or videos you link to within your Instagram stories to view more information. You can control what happens when they swipe — you can lead them to contact you or redirect them to your website.

Building a following for your personal brand and keeping it fresh isn’t always easy, but leveraging creative marketing tactics like these can make the process a lot easier. Whether you're creating exclusive posts for LinkedIn and Instagram or testing out newer marketing channels such as podcasting, if you’re open to experimenting and can be consistent, you may be rewarded for your efforts.",
"Two of my favorite things in life are baseball and great movies, so it would surprise no one that I love

. Nominated for three Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and deemed ""culturally, historically or aesthetically significant"" by the

is perhaps best remembered for its most famous line, the words of wisdom that inspired the movie’s main character, Ray Kinsella, to transform his Iowa cornfield into a ballpark: ""If you build it, he will come.""

Memorable catchphrases from classic movies are often used to draw broader lessons, and many entrepreneurs believe that if they build a great product, customers will automatically follow. But in the real world, if you build it, your audience will not come -- unless you can effectively market. You need a strong sales and marketing effort to get your product in the hands of consumers. In other words, on an organizational level, you need to promote.

As critical as it is to get the word out, many marketing campaigns and sales tactics actually repel customers. Being too promotional is off-putting, counterproductive and self-defeating. So, how can entrepreneurs, salespeople and marketers walk the fine line of actively promoting without being too promotional? Here are three best practices everyone should follow:

Marketers often advocate a “shock and awe” approach to brand building. When you are trying to establish awareness within the marketplace and gain mindshare, it is essential to get in front of your target audience. With all of the noise out there, it usually takes several touch points for brands to actually connect with consumers, let alone resonate with them to the point that business will be transacted. Even the most memorable commercials are run over and over and over.

But even when aggressively marketing, it is important to remember that less can be more. Make your point and do so memorably -- but being overly promotional can backfire. If you send out newsletters too often, recipients will unsubscribe. If you are too blatant in promoting yourself or your company on social media, people will be turned off and will unfollow you. Embrace subtlety in your messaging and in your overall philosophy toward promotional marketing.

A great way to promote without being promotional is by marketing through education. Blog posts that actually provide value to readers are far more likely to be read and shared than posts oriented around describing how good your products and services are. If a newsletter educates you on a topic of interest to you, you will actually look forward to it rather than looking forward to unsubscribing from it.

Several years ago, we noticed a lot of people unsubscribing from our newsletters for Beverly Hills Chairs, our e-commerce office furniture company. While the person running the campaign was focused on getting the Beverly Hills Chairs name out there, he annoyed people with the frequency with which he sent emails, leading to opt-outs. The newsletters themselves did not provide meaningful value -- they promoted deals and promoted products but rarely provided educational value to readers.

On the contrary, we have observed that the Cigar 101 section on Custom Tobacco, our e-commerce custom cigar business, has attracted lots of customers, as we created a bible for anyone interested in learning about cigars and have it on the website. Content marketing is a great way to get in front and stay in of customers and to effectively promote without being overtly promotional.

No matter how often you are promoting something, it is important to believe in what you are selling. Great salespeople sell products and services they do not believe in all the time, but when you actually do believe in your offering, you will be exponentially more effective. Passion is contagious but hard to manufacture. When something excites you, the excitement can rub off on your audience. But when you are truly indifferent, savvy customers will recognize your apathy and more aggressively question your value proposition.

Before promoting a product, service or even yourself, make sure that you are genuinely excited about your offering. The difference between intriguing your audience and being too promotional can be your own conviction.",None
"No matter how large your business or your sales team, effective sales leadership training can be the difference between leading or lagging in your marketplace, profit and loss and, ultimately, success and failure. Yes, the stakes can be that high.

But what does effective sales leadership training look like? What essential courses must be in the curriculum to help your organization empower your sales leader to succeed?

Certainly, the whole organization can benefit from effective sales leadership training when learned skills transfer to daily operations of the business. But certain sales department individuals would benefit the most and should be considered to participate in such training. These might include:

• Any valued member of your team you want to grow into a sales leadership role

• An underperforming sales manager who misses revenue goals or has an unfocused team

• Someone new to the leadership role, who doesn’t yet have the skills or tools to properly lead

• A skilled sales leader whose attitude can use some adjustment, so they can realize their true potential

With these participants in mind, then, what should effective sales leadership training include?

1. Setting Your Team Up For Success

Successful sales management and sales leadership depend first on creating an environment where success can happen day after day, client after client.

Upon completion of the training, the trainee must be able to understand the components needed to create a successful sales environment. These include holding others accountable, fostering open communication, following solid hiring processes and investing in specific training.

The trainee should come away from the training understanding the importance of clarity in expressing expectations, measurement, and consequences, as these are vital to accountability.

Fostering open communication is vital, too, as this will help the trainee eliminate judgment and negative behavior by proactively addressing these issues.

Understanding your client is also a critical training component. This can be accomplished through data analysis, as well as by identifying similarities and patterns in demographics, culture and organization. Similarly, the trainee should learn how to identify ideal buyer personas and how to design a detailed buying process for each persona. Beyond this, the trainee should understand how to align your sales process with each phase of your ideal customer’s buying process.

Successful sales organizations utilize an effective sales strategy and planning. Naturally, then, these must be part of any effective sales leadership training program.

Defining the sales strategy is a key place to start. Trainees should end up knowing key components of a client acquisition strategy, including desired customers and segments. Just as important are the needs to fully understand your competition and how to optimize your sales structure to compete and win.

Effective training should include instruction on how to create successful sales plans, including keeping each plan simple and measurable, gaining salesperson insights and setting challenging goals. Another key training topic should focus on helping the learner know the difference between leading and lagging indicators.

Effective sales management and sales leadership eventually depend on getting the most from your sales team. Therefore, another crucial topic area for effective sales training is how to create a motivating environment while also holding sales team members accountable.

In this section, learners should be trained on how to create a coaching culture and mindset. This should include reinforcing a coaching approach that adapts to the needs of each subordinate and empowers employees to meet challenges with their own solutions.

Training in this section should also teach the learner how to support a salesperson with low ability, by providing additional resources or training, by altering job responsibilities or by reassigning the poor performer. The trainee should understand the importance of recognizing and addressing poor performance immediately, including the use of a performance improvement plan (PIP) if appropriate.

In every sales organization, it is important to productively recruit, hire and onboard new employees. The sales training you choose should support this.

Hiring topics, for example, should include evaluating how the candidate’s skills and experience align with the job description, how to use a consistent hiring process, and how to use a proper assessment tool for new employee selection.

When the right candidate is hired, onboarding is often an afterthought. This is a critical mistake, so training should address this upfront with guidance for effective onboarding.

Of course, day-to-day oversight of the sales function is a key part of the sales manager’s job. This includes pipeline management and sales forecasting.

Curriculum in this training area should include details on how to utilize a customer relationship management (CRM) system. This should cover strategies, principles, guidelines and technologies used for developing, retaining and acquiring customers. Setting up your CRM and getting the most from analytics is essential to pipeline management, so these should be key training components as well. Forecasting is also a critical component of sales success and should be a training requirement. This might include understanding essential sales forecasting models.

Effective sales training is a worthwhile investment. Cover these five topics to empower your team to succeed.",
"Beneath the awe of the Northern lights,

Security responsibility lies with all in the wonderland,

Aiming to identify, monitor and control data at hand.

How could Santa encourage a cyber security culture within his magical workshop?  How could this culture help you?  The purpose of this article is for you, my loyal readers, to extract ideas to incorporate into your own company's culture, if you wish.

Welcome to part 3, of ""How Santa's Cyber Security Culture Can Work For You!""  In Part 1, I refer to cyber attacks and the overall aim of a Santa's security training and awareness programme.  Part 2 defines some of the key security roles, which will need to be taken on by Santa's little helpers.  Part 3 discusses elements for assessing training & awareness.

As Santa’s little helpers will be the weakest link in security, the establishment of a security culture is essential. A security culture will help to protect the assets of Santa's workshop by minimising the threats and vulnerabilities caused by the behaviour of the helpers.

Cyber security, a must-have to maintain secure operations in today’s world, involves a range of closely-linked metrics. These metrics must be addressed and understood by Santa and his helpers in order to help establish a security culture within Lapland's workshop. Achieving this will involve conducting a comprehensive assessment of the workshop’s behaviour, e.g. via a survey conducted annually.

The workshop’s security culture should be measured to assess its present strengths and weaknesses. This can be done at three levels:

The metrics can include the following:

This assessment is a quality management process that enables a constant and continual improvement of the workshop’s security culture and awareness measures at the leadership, departmental and helper-employee levels. Technical and non-technical areas are examined, indicating the level of satisfaction with security measures, management support, security policy, etc.

Prior to conducting this assessment, Santa and his helpers may want to do the following:

Whilst I will not specify potential survey questions, here are some things to consider when determining the questions and analysing the results:

The results of the assessment will help to identify:

"On Tuesday, November 13, Amazon announced it would be splitting its second headquarters across two sites, one in Crystal City, Virginia and the other in Long Island City, New York. Since then, I’ve had the opportunity to speak with Brian Kropp, a group vice president at research and advisory company Gartner, who has insights into the consequences of that decision. Here’s what he had to say.

Michael B. Arthur: Let’s look first at the employers already established in those areas. Will anything change?

Brian Kropp: Employers in either of these locations should expect at least three significant issues to emerge. The first is that employees will be distracted as they see job postings appear and explore what it might be like to work at Amazon. Second, based on this employee behavior, employers should expect turnover to occur. Some employees will leave, and it could be a significant number depending on what industry the company is in and what employees’ roles are. Also important to note is that this increased turnover isn’t just about a company’s employees who leave for Amazon—there will be a ripple effect as Amazon hires employees and then organizations that experience workers leaving look to fill those vacant roles. Ultimately, the entire region’s labor market will likely feel the implications of Amazon’s new headquarters. Finally, employers should anticipate an increase in compensation costs. Amazon will pay more for some jobs and for area companies to remain competitive, they will naturally have to increase salaries to retain and attract talent.

Arthur: Let’s now turn to the experience for employees, what will it be like for them?

Kropp: Wages will increase. Most of the jobs that Amazon will create in these two locations will focus on higher-end, more professional services positions rather than warehousing or distribution center jobs. Amazon clearly pointed out that their choice in locations was based on the quality of talent in those geographies. Given that, they will be competing for the best talent in those areas, which will naturally bid up salaries.

Those individuals who are thinking about relocating to one of these cities for Amazon need to evaluate what workplace factors are most important for them. Everyone holds particular workplace attributes that help them determine where to work, for instance some individuals look for career opportunities, others focus on compensation or maybe work-life balance.

Before accepting a new job, whether at Amazon, or frankly any organization, an individual needs to understand what parts of the employment value proposition are most important to them and how that aligns with a potential employer. For some, accepting a job at Amazon will be a great career move, while for others, it may not be as beneficial. The key for employees is to understand what a job is actually like before accepting a new position.

So, how do people find that information when a company like Amazon enters a new geographic location? Prospective employees need to do a bit of research by reviewing as much material from that employer as possible. Look at the career section of the company’s website, review the company background section, and question whether or not this company’s mission and workplace culture would be a good fit. Review job websites that list current and past employee feedback on what it’s like to work there to help determine if a particular company would match career expectations. And finally, the best source of information—speaking with current and former employees.

Arthur: As someone who works in talent management, which is about the relationship between employers and their employees, what do you think is going to happen in those relationships?

Kropp: As expected, employers and employees typically have different perspectives on their relationship. Employers need people to do the work at hand, while employees think about what’s next in their career. Gartner research shows that when managers talk with their employees about how their work in the company makes them more attractive to other potential employers, employees actually become more loyal to the company. Particularly in an environment with limited promotions and raises, which is the case for many companies today, focusing on employability and how the experiences provided will increase a worker’s expertise and make them more attractive candidates to others can make an employee feel that their employer is truly invested in them and their career. Employers might be afraid to have this conversation for fear that it may lead employees to leave, but our research is showing the reverse is true. Instead of avoiding these targeted conversations about career paths and opportunities, employers who encourage them to happen can actually make employees more productive and effective, reducing the likelihood of turnover.

Arthur: Let me close with a different question. What would you like to see in those relationships?

Kropp: The way employees are managed needs to change. Recent Gartner research found that “connector managers” generate higher levels of employee productivity.

Connector managers cultivate meaningful connections to and among employees, teams, and the organization to develop an employee’s specific capabilities. They guide their direct reports to resources beyond their own organization to help identify the best opportunities to gain experience, skills, and capabilities. According to our research, connector managers improve employee performance by 26%. Better managers also lead to less turnover.",
"Many view the start of a new year as an opportunity to make personal resolutions and commitments to self-improvement. You may vow to exercise more frequently, save more money, or reach a benchmark career goal. Unfortunately, according to research conducted by the University of Scranton, just 8% of people keep their New Year's resolutions -- though more than 40% of Americans make them.

Why do we fail to achieve these personal and professional results -- and what steps can you take to ensure that you meet your goals for growth in the coming year?

There's great value in setting meaningful, memorable, and measurable New Year's resolutions, both in our personal lives and at work. The reason that people most often break these resolutions is not because they are too ambitious, but because they are too vague.

For example, you might resolve to go to the gym more often; but if you don't have a measurable objective to work towards, such as going for three 5-mile runs each week, you are likely to lose sight of your resolution before January's drawn to a close.

These resolutions should be guided by underlying beliefs and experiences that drive progress. While concrete benchmarks are certainly setting meaningful, a change of perspective is also required: if individuals choose to view their resolutions as a dynamic, ongoing dedication to positive growth, they can more readily achieve lasting, sustainable change.

Another reason that resolutions often flop is that they are not reinforced by positive principled accountability. Accountability, as defined by the New York Times bestselling book The Oz Principle, is the ""personal choice to rise above one's circumstances and demonstrate the ownership necessary for achieving desired results.""

When a person proactively takes accountability for delivering the results they want to see, they are better positioned to meet short-term goals and leverage creative problem-solving in order to hit crucial targets. This model of accountability can be applied to drive progress towards both individual goals and crucial deliverables in the workplace -- simultaneously promoting individual growth and the success of the organization.

The Role of Accountability in the Workplace

Highly accountable teams are high-performing teams. When every employee takes personal accountability for delivering on Key Results, they are able to visualize and take ownership for existing roadblocks, creatively strategize ways to overcome those roadblocks, and implement effective solutions to achieve topline objectives.

However, high levels of accountability at work should not be seen as merely instrumental in achieving results, but as a desired Key Result in and of itself. Committing to increased accountability in the workplace not only drives organizational results but propels personal growth and happiness at work as well.

In fact, according to the results of our ""Happiness at Work"" survey, most employees agree that taking more accountability in the workplace has positively impacted their level of engagement at work. This is a critical connection considering that high levels of engagement translate to higher rates of overall job satisfaction -- while low levels of engagement correlate with unhappiness at work.

As our research reveals, when employees are happier at work, 85% take more initiative, while nearly 50% say they care more about their work. What's more, research conducted by the Social Market Foundation and the University of Warwick's Centre for Competitive Advantage in the Global Economy found that happy employees are more productive overall.

Ultimately, making the personal resolution to take on more accountability generates a positive cycle of overcoming obstacles and proactively thinking in a way that delivers on the Key Results that your team, company, or you personally must achieve. Increased personal accountability fosters a strong sense of personal agency, ownership, and connection to one's work that promotes happiness and personal growth.",wellness
"Although the idea of perfect anything sounds like the ultimate goal, in reality, striving for perfection may be negatively affecting your life. In many ways, it can even be holding you back and changing how you see yourself and the world.

For example, with your sights set on perfection, you may think in black and white, or in all-or-nothing terms. Things are either good or bad, right or wrong. Naturally, this way of thinking can lead to a very stressful life, because there are no gray areas in situations -- just perfect events or full-on disasters.

Even further, as you strive for excellence, you can actually start to think less of yourself. Your self-confidence becomes heavily dependent on how much and what you accomplish, and you may pay close attention to how other people react to you and your achievements.

When validation from others is needed in order for you to feel good about what you do, you decrease the importance of validation you could be receiving from yourself. When you depend on the opinions of others more than your own thoughts, you think of yourself as the lesser, as the person with reduced value.

Even further, you might not even grant yourself the chance to raise your self-worth: perfectionists, once achieving something, often quickly move on to the next goal. Ambitious perfectionists hope to succeed often, and in a short amount of time -- and if you don't slow down to appreciate your own hard work, you may never see how successful you already are.

Unfortunately, this excessive desire to compete with others and succeed might not be going anywhere anytime soon.

One 2018 study found that more recent generations of college students reported significantly higher scores for different forms of perfectionism than earlier generations. And, says researchers, this increase may in part be tied to higher reported levels of depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts, in comparison to a decade ago.

So it is critically important that we realize now how perfectionism impacts us. Not only does it limit your personal growth and obstruct your self-worth, but it can affect your mental health, too.

If you think a successful life is a perfect life, consider instead the idea that perfectionism can actually lead you away from the very same success you're after.",
"One of the things great managers do well is finding out each employee's unique talents and strengths.

After all, when you know what motivates your employees from the neck up, how each person naturally thinks, feels and behaves, you can better design job roles around those strengths.

Sometimes a team member may not be fully aware of what he naturally does best, or how to use his natural abilities to perform best for the job he's assigned.

This is when a good manager with a deep understanding of a team member's natural gifts will come alongside him and support him in finding new ways to use his strengths at work.

A hot tip for managers worried about losing their employees.

Let's agree that what one managers does exceptionally well may not even be a blip on another manager's radar screen. If your employees are losing focus, are disengaged, or are bored at work, it's every manager's duty to get fresh knowledge and insight about what you can do to improve and retain those valued employees--today--not after they have emotionally disconnected and stopped caring.

One of the best approaches to re-engage disengaged employees and energize them like never before is to conduct ""stay interviews."" The idea is based on honest two-way conversations where each side gets to listen, ask questions, and agree to follow-up on ideas and action plans.

The stay interview builds trust in leaders because you're basically telling your valued team member, ""Hey, I'd like to get a feel for what's working and not working for you, and learn how best to utilize your natural talents.""

In other words, what a manager is really saying in this case is, ""Hey, I really need to get to know you better."" What employee doesn't want this?

Gallup recently published an article to help managers clue in to the natural talents their employees bring to the table. Their ""five clues to talent"" framework helps managers to have meaningful conversations to ""better shape roles and responsibilities to fit individuals' best chances to succeed."" There are five questions a manager must ask:

1. What do you know you can do well but haven't done yet?

2. What sorts of activities do you finish and think, ""I can't wait to do that again""? Or what are you doing -- inside or outside work -- when you're truly enjoying yourself?

3. What have you done well that you didn't need someone to explain how to do?

According to Gallup, ""Employees' answers to these questions and the resulting conversations should be the foundation of any exceptional manager's efforts to energize and empower people to perform better by doing what they naturally do best every day.""",
"Imagine this: You are not sure what is going on, but you notice that your best employee has made some avoidable mistakes on the last two projects. You guess it must be stress related. However, two weeks later, your employee calls to say that he will be running late to work due to an emergency. ""That seemed strange, but life happens,"" you think to yourself. Over the next three weeks, this employee calls in sick about three times. Then, one morning, he walks into your office and gives you his resignation letter, stating that he has found another job. You are devastated — you did not want your best employee to leave. You wonder what you could have done to prevent it. You noticed the change in his behavior, but you failed to address it.

The story above is an example of what happens when an employee becomes disengaged. Signs of employee engagement include a lowered quality of work or a reduction in performance levels, dropping employee morale, tardiness, absenteeism and high voluntary employee resignations.

Here is another story: Susan, your employee, is always early to work and always at her desk by the time you get into the office. Every Monday, Susan initiates a discussion with you about what plans you have for the week and what you need her to accomplish. Susan is cheerful, kind and collaborative. She always thinks of creative solutions to problems in the workplace. Susan is displaying the qualities of an engaged employee. Employees who are engaged are enthusiastic about their job and committed to achieving successful outcomes for the team and organization. They often go above and beyond to execute job assignments. They often volunteer to lead projects and take great pride in their work.

According to a 2015 Gallup survey, about 32% of American employees were engaged at work. More than 50% were not engaged, and 17.2% were found to be ""actively disengaged."" In a 2018 survey, just 15% of employees worldwide were found to be engaged at work.

Engaged employees may become disengaged if their leaders do not recognize their efforts or share the vision of the company and team with them. Employees could also become disengaged if a company goes through frequent reorganizations. This gives employees a sense of uncertainty, and they begin to look outside the company for better opportunities. Alternatively, employees could become disengaged when their compensation is not satisfactory or when they are not offered growth and development opportunities.

Employee disengagement negatively impacts business productivity and revenue. Conversely, high employee engagement can increase employee productivity, business revenue and company image.

So, what can leaders do to avoid disengagement from happening and how can leaders improve employee engagement?

1. Leaders should share the vision, goal and strategy of the company with employees and involve employees in decision-making on issues that affect their work. Leaders can do this by collaborating with the human resources team to organize town hall sessions annually or quarterly. Further, supervisors could also share the strategic and operational objectives with their team in weekly or monthly meetings. Sharing the vision, goals and strategy of the company with employees enables them to easily understand how their job directly affects the company’s goals.

2. Leaders should discuss each employee's job description and how it ties to the business goals. This discussion should happen when new employees join the company and as part of a performance appraisal discussion. This will help employees know the expectations of their supervisor and the company.

3. Employee performance should be evaluated regularly. Employees' area of strengths should be recognized and leveraged. However, employees' area of improvement needs to be identified and appropriate training and development plans should be made. Organizations should have periodic performance appraisal periods yearly, in which supervisors are encouraged to discuss employee’s performance and career goals. When an employee is trained to improve their knowledge and performance, they become more engaged and productive.

4. Exemplary employee performance should be recognized, appreciated and rewarded with an incentive. When employees are appreciated for their work, they are more productive and committed to their work. Employees could be recognized by a simple “thank you,” public/team recognition or a bonus.

5. Leaders should have an open-door policy, and every employee should be encouraged to speak up about their questions or concerns. When employees feel that their opinions are heard and valued, they feel more comfortable in the team and can contribute more valuable solutions to business challenges.

6. Leaders should ask for upward feedback so that employees can let them know about their leadership performance. Leaders can proactively ask their employees for feedback during periodic performance appraisal sessions or at weekly team meetings so that required behavioral changes can be made. Some companies also incorporate supervisor assessments in their performance appraisal program. Supervisor assessments can also be utilized for upward feedback.

As you use these recommendations, I believe that your employees will become more engaged and your business productivity will improve.",
"Nonprofit organizations rely heavily on generous donors to keep the business going. In today's climate of divisive politics, social justice movements and tax reform, charitable giving is more susceptible than ever to the trends of our time -- and if nonprofits keep up with those trends, they'll be able to market their causes properly and bring in more donations than ever.

We asked a panel of Forbes Nonprofit Council members to weigh in on some of the trends that could impact donations and giving in 2019. Here's what they had to say.

Numerous tax changes are going into effect that may positively impact us on some level, as nonprofits. It's important to watch how organizations and individuals react to these tax changes to see if they are willing to contribute the same amount. We've already sent out content that shares what the tax changes mean for contributions to help our audience understand. - Gloria Horsley, Open to Hope

We will see a surge in ways that nonprofits offer tax-deductible giving options specifically designed to influence voting outcomes in 2019 and beyond to the critical 2020 election year. This could mean opportunities to donate to groups that align with the candidates you support or groups that advocate for easier -- or tougher-- voting laws to empower or suppress the vote. - Thomas Bognanno, Community Health Charities

The same gut-filled angst that brought ""rage philanthropy"" into play will continue to play out in ways that will benefit nonprofits. People want to be heard and will make their point by making donations to the causes that are important to them. Donors are intelligent and certainly have access to more data to make impactful decisions, in spite of tax reforms and the threat of defunded programs. - Kimberly Lewis, Goodwill Industries of East Texas, Inc.

4. Donations Will Be Driven By Compassion And Generosity

I believe that the vast majority of donors give because they believe in the cause(s), and they are deeply compassionate and generous individuals. That will not change even in the face of tax reform or ""rage philanthropy."" Our goal and challenge as leaders is to be sure that these hard-earned donor dollars are well spent and that the work of our organizations fulfills our promises to the donors! - Rachel Zelon, Hunger Relief International

As candidates begin to declare their campaign intentions and new legislation is introduced, we will begin to see a dramatic ramp-up in political giving throughout 2019 that will reach a fever pitch in 2020. Many donors will raise their voice on key societal issues, from housing to health care, through their political giving. - Steven Moore, M.J. Murdock Charitable Trust

One trend that will impact charitable giving in the new year is the increase on donor-advised funds for charitable and tax giving purposes. - Angelique Sina, Friends of Puerto Rico

7. People Will Always Be Inspired To Help Other People

Social intelligence and human connection will not change -- despite laws, economies or politics. People will be inspired to help their fellow man, whether it be through needs, opportunity, empowerment, investment or emotional intelligence. Our job is to meet the donor where they are and provide a path to giving and ease of use. - Aaron Alejandro, Texas FFA Foundation",
"Maybe you’ve heard of co-CEOing, two people sharing the same role at the top of an organization. Sure, some founding entrepreneurs are choosing to run their companies as co-CEOs, but so are others. It’s a small trend that some people are hoping will catch on. If you are searching for a stable governance model and persuasive arguments to a board of directors, there are good reasons to consider this approach.

Two former executive coaching clients of mine, Jocelyn and Karlee, lead an organization as co-CEOs. I worked with them after coaching the CEO and founder who wanted them to grow and develop in their senior roles.

If you want to share the CEO role, the following persuasive arguments might just work in your favor:

1. Good decisions come from divergent thinking. I’ve seen how more deliberate thinking happens when two equal voices work together to create better decisions. Bringing two heads together is even more vital now with the increased pressure to have a broader outlook and creative approach to solve problems.

2. Responsibilities are clearly defined. Jocelyn leads the operations, finance, communications and legal teams, and Karlee leads the investment, programs, knowledge management and innovation marketplace teams. Each works to her areas of experience and strength. There’s joint decision making on strategic items of top importance to the organization, which include strategy, board and primary funder relationships, and shaping organizational culture.

3. Shared and equal accountability. I believe no co-CEO model could work without both individuals sharing accountability for the organization’s successes and failures.

4. Greater reach. You can be in two places at once because there are two of you. This may please stakeholders who expect engagement with the top executive.

5. A track record of collaborative decision making. Working together for years has groomed Jocelyn and Karlee to be receptive to one another’s ideas and willing to adjust their thinking so that they are reliably able to reach an agreement.

6. Sustainable working lives. In my experience, newly promoted leaders often seek to have work-life balance. Sharing the role means one unplugs over their vacation and family emergencies that come up, while the other takes charge. It’s seamless. I believe the future of work is shifting toward alternative schedules to include life’s priorities, such as a healthy lifestyle and more time for family and friends.

7. It’s less stressful at the top. Having someone to share the burdens of strategy and fiscal responsibility could be less stressful on you.

8. Different backgrounds mean more expertise. My clients have different backgrounds: law and business for one and science and programs for the other, which is beneficial for their organization. It’s a great advantage to have two CEOs with different backgrounds, because it’s a challenge for one person to go broad and sufficiently deep in so much that is demanded from a single CEO in this age of complexity and churn.

Because the co-CEO model hasn’t yet achieved widespread acceptance, people may contest that it can’t possibly work. That’s why it’s worth developing your positioning to address these challenges, too. Here are a number of objections and useful things to consider:

Objection: There will be confusion and chaos if there is no tie-breaker.

Consider: How will you make decisions when both of you have a different view?

Objection: Only someone who will do it all should assume the role.

Consider: Can you demonstrate confidence that you can do the role in its entirety, but benefit the organization by having the two of you?

Objection: Collaboration is a nice idea, but only one person can fill the vital role of CEO.

Consider: Find other examples of where it’s worked, and prepare success stories of times when collaboration won the day.

Objection: A CEO is always the leader out in front.

Consider: Leadership is multidimensional. Leaders operate not just in front, but in tandem with other leaders where the interplay of leading and following happens organically (and authentically).

Objection: It will be twice as expensive to have two people in the role.

Consider: What smart economics can you identify to have two people occupy the role? Where are the efficiencies you can propose in the organizational design?

You might want to consider the advantages of sharing the top role with someone else. For CEOs everywhere, the leader role is a lonely one. Two isn’t just far less lonely; it can also provide for more agility to have two senior leaders with distinct backgrounds able to get the best strategic thinking for your organization.",
"You don’t have to look too far across entrepreneurial blog posts to see that this time of the year is ripe for the planning season. Even in our personal lives, the year-end brings with it a flurry of ‘what next?’.

For many, they will race ahead into planning season without considering critical steps, with human nature immediately wanting to jump into the ‘doing’ mode.

Too often at this time of year, with our focus on the future, we overlook a critical phase that contributes just as much (if not more) to your success.

These next five women run hugely successful businesses, from a cross-section of niches—anything from healthy living to money mindset and motherhood. They’re heart-centered entrepreneurs, meaning that they are in business to also make a difference in the world.

And, all five share a common message: prioritizing a ‘review’ or evaluation phase of the year that has been will make a big difference to your success, both personally and professionally.

Kris Carr recently blogged about the two phases of year-end planning mode as ‘honoring your year’ first before ‘intention-setting’. She too cautions that often we want to skip ahead to the planning without fully evaluating what has been and celebrating our successes. Kris sets out seven questions which will guide you to spend time in review before charging ahead.

Marie shares a quote from Margaret Wheatley (a leadership expert) in her year-in-review advice, “Without reflection, we go blindly on our way, creating more unintended consequences, and failing to achieve anything useful.”

Marie’s success has been built on consistency, and this reflection process is part of that. She says the process does not need to be too long, even spending 10 minutes and asking yourself these three questions could make all the difference.

Kate Northrup, in short, teaches women how to ‘do less’ whilst having more. Kate and her partner, in business and life, Mike, take a full day or two out each year to focus on these questions. The structure they follow is similar to Kris Carr and Marie Forleo, further reiterating the importance of time out for review, just as much as planning.

Denise’s recent year-end review blog post gives incredibly valuable insight into her own business and success, including revenue, profit and even the number of courses sold. Reading through her personal review you get a sense of a similar structure: what worked, what didn’t and what needs tweaking for next time around. She’s honest, reflective and personal. Reiterating also that a year-end-review is about much more than just business.

5. Danielle La Porte – Entrepreneur, author, Forbes “Top 100 Websites for Women” and HuffPost “12 of The Wisest Twitter Accounts Worth Following.”

When it comes to year-end reviews, Danielle La Porte’s process stems from what she first shared in her book, The Desire Map, which she has evolved into an entire planning system.

The key message is that in order to live a life (and grow a business) that truly makes you happy, you must be creating ‘goals with soul’ and start with how you want to feel rather than what you want to get or have. Her year-in-review questions are simple and to the point (similar to Marie Forelo’s advice): What worked, what didn’t, and what are some highlights? How deep you take it really is up to you.

You could say that all five of these women are remarkably ‘busy’ and yet all still prioritize this process of review and not just planning. They also integrate their business with their personal life. Something that many people miss entirely, focusing too much on taking care of their ‘job’ instead of ‘themselves’. Creating space for review this year-end will make all the difference to your success in the new year.",
"When it comes to building a productive, profitable team, hiring top talent is only part of the battle. Once you have team members on board, it's critical to keep them engaged and excited to do great work every day. But unfortunately, according to a recent report from Gallup, up to 85 percent of U.S. employees consider themselves to be disengaged.

A top reason many employees are disengaged is that they're simply in the wrong roles. But this doesn't mean they're a poor fit for your team as a whole. If you have quality employees who appear disengaged or seems like they're itching to try something new, one way to increase engagement is by suggesting transitioning roles or teams. This term is known across many companies as ""internal mobility."" And while 87 percent of companies believe that internal mobility programs would definitely help with retention, only one-third have these programs, according to a study by FutureStep.

It likely comes as no surprise that many of the world's most successful tech companies not only embrace internal mobility but have strategies in place to encourage it. Google has long touted its ""20 percent time"" policy (it might no longer be in place, but was for many years). With this policy, employees dedicate 20 percent of their time to side projects or testing the waters with different roles.



Gmail, Google Maps and other key developments have been the result of Google's 20 percent time policy. And not only has this policy benefited Google with many critical innovations, but it helps employees better understand whether a different role or team might be a fit.

At Spotify, not only are employees encouraged to take part in internal mobility, but it's the norm across many roles. Many employees complete ""missions,"" meaning they often don't stay in a given role for any longer than two years. Spotify CEO Daniel Ek attributed this strategy to the fact that millennials in the tech sector switch jobs an average of once every 1.8 years, in large part due to their jobs growing stagnant. Spotify's internal mobility strategy keeps employees engaged and excited to continue evolving with the company.

How You Can Encourage Internal Mobility

To support internal mobility on your team, you truly need a company culture that encourages this practice. Some employees might be interested in a new role, but hesitant to reach out or apply for fear or it being frowned upon or offending their managers.

One step you can take to support employees interested in new roles is by opening positions internally before sharing them externally. Let employees know they're welcome to apply, as long as they first touch base with their managers about their interest in the role and career goals. If they don't end up getting the new role, managers can work with employees on an individual basis to ensure the company is supporting their overall career growth.

On my team of nearly 200 at Hireology, we're opening several new roles to set ourselves up for success over the next year - and beyond. We recently hosted a lunch and learn for the whole company, in which the new roles were shared and employees were encouraged to apply if interested. We've had many employees who have switched teams - in some cases, multiple times - and it often works out for the better, both for the employee and company.

One Hireology employee has been on our sales, customer success, customer support and business operations team. Another started out on the sales side and is now a product manager. We openly encourage internal mobility on my team, because we want to keep our best employees for the long run and ensure they're satisfied and continuing to grow in their roles.

At the end of the day, encouraging internal mobility will help you keep employees engaged and stick with your team as a whole. As a result, this will increase overall productivity and boost your company's long-term success.",
"We are promoting individual contributors into leadership roles who don't have the capacity to lead, and then demanding that they become leaders overnight by forcing them into classroom training.

The approach is wrong and the solution is, actually, quite simple. Rather than ""investing"" money in expensive and unsustainable workshops or online curriculums, decision-makers should be intently focused on identifying and promoting leaders already equipped with people skills to advance their organizations.

The simple truth is that leadership is about people and relationships. Great leaders aspire to lead by serving the needs of their people. Plainly put, the best of them are sincerely more interested in the success of their people than in their own.

So what will this philosophy in practice at the ground level look like, whether you're a supervisor of three or a CEO of 25,000? It comes down to recognizing and applying some simple traits in action.

Great leaders support their people by showing an interest in their jobs and career aspirations. They look into the future to create learning and development opportunities. They find out what motivates their best people by getting to know each tribe member's desires that will drive them. This is about emotional engagement. Remember this quote by John C. Maxwell? ""People don't care how much you know until they know how much you care.""

In several studies, empathy has been found to be a critical driver of human performance. Specifically, the ability of leaders to listen and respond with empathy. In business conversations that value relationship-building, thinking about a team member's circumstance, understanding someone's challenge and frustration, and developing perspective about what motivates an employee to high performance opens up all kinds of possibilities for other team members to help one another.

Individuals aspiring to become great leaders must increase their capacity to be more transparent and straight with people. For example, when an employee's performance just isn't cutting it, a leader has to tell that person straight up and hold the bar up high. Help the team member close the gap with clear expectations and measures of success, while supporting him along the way, not hanging him out to dry. After 90 days, if performance hasn't improved, it's probably not a good fit. Be radically transparent with your reasons, don't sweep anything under the rug, and help him transition out of the organization with dignity and respect.

It starts and ends with relationships

Nothing in the practices above is possible without first investing time in your most valued employees to learn who they really are as people. Like most exceptional human leaders, do everything you can to know their strengths and talents and help develop them for new roles and career paths to ensure long-term success for you and your employees.",
"The world is becoming more connected every single day with the mass adoption of the internet over the past 20 years. And it’s leading to more companies hiring remotely. According to the fifth annual “Freelancing in America 2018” report put together by Upwork, the freelance workforce in the U.S. has grown from 53 to 56.7 million Americans in the past five years. Those 56.7 million people make up 35% of the American workforce.

As a business owner, the idea of running your company 100% remote is no longer a pie in the sky. Rather, it is a reality for millions of digital businesses around the world that are tapping into the growing freelance workforce and using technology to creatively communicate with the people they hire.

While running a remote company has become a possibility in the past 10 years for the reasons mentioned above, it is still not an easy undertaking and it requires the right tools and policies to properly implement and scale.

Since 2009, I’ve been at the forefront of building remote companies and workforces by experimenting with the new technologies and platforms available for finding talent online, communicating with remote hires and managing tasks in the digital world. Below, I’ll outline the four unique communication methods that can help you build a completely remote organization from anywhere in the world.

Running a remote company raises the challenge of staying on the same page with the people you’ve hired, some of whom could be halfway across the world. If you were operating out of an office, you could easily walk over to their desk to ask them a question and receive updates on their work. When running a company where your entire staff is remote, you still need that ability to check in and stay on the same page. To overcome the barrier of distance, use tools like Skype, Slack, WhatsApp and Viber for real-time communication.

As your remote team continues to grow, set clear expectations on how you’d like to receive daily updates from everyone. I personally recommend asking each person on your team to check in with you using one of the real-time communication apps mentioned above when they start working and when they finish working. As they start, you ask that they let you know what they’ll be working on for the day. Then when they finish, they send a short report of what they were able to achieve, any issues they ran into and any questions they have for you.

By setting up a clear channel of real-time communication, you gain the ability to stay in close touch with your remote team, even if you’re thousands of miles away.

As your organization grows, it’s critical that you build and maintain a company culture that inspires and motivates the people you’ve hired. One of the best ways to bring everyone together from your remote company is to schedule a weekly all-hands meeting where you share updates, set goals for the week, brainstorm new solutions and learn more about one another.

I personally recommend using Skype or Slack chat for your all-hands meeting, as it will be the simplest way for everyone to get together in one place without having to deal with potential audio and video issues.

On top of the weekly all-hands meeting, which is meant for company culture and team motivation, it’s important that you personally keep in close touch with the people and teams that you’re managing.

Each week or every other week, depending on the size of your company, schedule a team meeting or 1-on-1 meeting where you dive deeper into the goals for that specific person or team. Provide a vision of where the team is headed and keep pushing them forward.

For these types of meetings, a phone call or video chat may be better than an instant message chat. It will give you the opportunity to get to know your team better on a personal level and build a stronger bond that is hard to create without the existence of an office where you can have regular physical interactions.

Whether you’re running your company out of an office or completely remote, people like to receive feedback and they like the ability to have their voices heard. Make sure that you schedule quarterly 1-on-1 meetings with each person on your remote team with the goal of letting them know what they’re doing well, where they can improve and what the vision of the company is at that point in time.

By giving your personal attention to each person on a quarterly basis, you further build a relationship of trust with them that will motivate them to work harder, learn more and stay with your company longer. The quarterly evaluations can also be an amazing opportunity to learn about the specifics of the company -- specifics around which you can then create new plans for improvement.

To start and scale a 100% remote company today, you need sound communication methods. You need proper systems in place so that you can easily manage and lead the people that you’ve hired to build your remote company.

If you’re a business owner already running a remote company, evaluate your current communication methods and incorporate any of the four mentioned in this article if you don’t utilize them already.

If you’re a business owner who is starting to think about hiring remotely, take these four remote communication methods into account as you build out your management philosophy for running a remote company.

At the end of the day, the tools are now available to make remote companies possible -- it’s up to you to utilize them and prioritize communication within your remote culture.",
"Some folks may approach every New Year with the same resolution, whether it be losing weight, becoming better organized or finally writing that novel.

Resolutions don't have to be static, though, and a business may need to revisit its goals to adjust to its own rapid growth, evolving market conditions or other significant changes.

NuORDER, a B2B e-commerce platform, for example, plans changes to accommodate its growth.

The venture, which recently partnered with Nordstrom and announced a $15 million Series C funding round – the company's raised nearly $37 million in all, according to Crunchbase – will be setting a new pace and approach for management team meetings in 2019.

Until now, the team managed the seven-year-old business on a ""quarterly cadence,"" co-founder and co-CEO Olivia Skuza explained recently. ""We would plan each quarter and then review results at the end of the quarter. This quarterly cadence worked well when the business was smaller. But as we grow and the complexity of the business increases, we have decided that we need to move to a semi-monthly cadence.""

In 2019, the team will meet every two weeks to assess the company's progress against goals.

""During these meetings, we are employing the philosophy of radical honesty, whereby each functional leader has the opportunity, and is encouraged, to ask tough questions of their peers, without reservation, with the goal of identifying gaps and then working together (as) a team to close them,"" said Skuza.

""We believe that employing the radical honesty philosophy in a semi-monthly goal review cadence will help us ensure we achieve the many aggressive goals we've set for the business in 2019.”

Jenaé Elizabeth, founder and CEO of the Dance Dynamix dance studio, which is based in Landover, Md., and operates locations throughout the Washington, D.C., region, said she's making changes in 2019 after years of growth and a more recent plateau.

After operating the newest location for two years, the company has decided its top goal for 2019 is tracking and analyzing metrics to make data-driven marketing decisions, she said.

""Over the past seven years we've grown the studio primarily through word of mouth.  As a service-based creative business owner, it's easy to get caught in the cycle of relying on what we used to do. But this year we've seen our growth plateau and we realize that to reach more people we have to utilize current and fresh strategies. Simply put, we have to move with the market,"" said Elizabeth.

""Word of mouth is still king, but after conducting a few client-based focus groups we learned that millennial moms find out about events and new opportunities via social media. Social media is word of mouth on overload!"" she said.

Dance Dynamix recently hired a marketing company that specializes in studio marketing and is focusing on:

""Having not previously paid for marketing, investing in this area feels like a significant risk,"" said Elizabeth. ""Marketing seems like paying for an experiment. However, our 2019 goal of impacting more people is worth the investment.""",None
"As Weiner mentioned in a September CNBC interview, all employees want the same thing: to have a manager who cares about them and does everything in their power to set them up to be successful.

Now, if I ask you to think of a ""bad manager,"" you'll probably come up with an image of a bully who likes to micromanage their staff, and never lets anyone take any time off. You're nothing like that person, so you can't be a bad manager. Right?

Well, not exactly. If you're guilty of delegating tasks to your team members without taking the time to mentor them, you could be seen as a bad manager, too.

Weiner says the problem arises when employees feel as though their managers don't have time to invest in them. Look at it this way: If you've never shown any interest in your team's personal development, or asked them what they want to accomplish in their careers, it's easy for them to feel like a cog in a machine.

You can retain A-players (and allow them to work at their best).

If your goal is to create an environment where employees can do their best work, it's important to help your employees form a sense of belonging. It's not rocket science. Having a sense of belonging increases job satisfaction, and job satisfaction in turn increases performance and retention.

Everyone wants to hire superstars, so you should assume that your competitors are trying to poach your best employees every week. How do you make it easy for your superstars to choose to stay?

First, make sure you recognize them and appreciate their contributions to their company. Next, talk to them about their goals and let them know they've got space to grow in your company. You want them to think of their current gig as a long-term career option, not just a stepping stone.

I also like to make sure I screen new hires properly and make sure they're a good fit. Superstars like to work with other superstars, so if you hire folks who have bad attitudes and can't get their jobs done, chances are that your best people will get frustrated and leave.

The bottom line: Invest more time in your employees.",wellness
"It’s no secret that networking has the greatest impact on business and career growth. Especially in today’s hyper-connected world, the best way to find a job or business opportunity comes from a personal recommendation. Cultivating your own network today will set you up for a solid future. The way to grow that network is by making connections, so how can you do that? Let’s take a look at the five traits that all highly connected people share.

Building a network is really all about building relationships. Relationships are built on genuine interactions. When you connect with someone, you have to show genuine, honest interest. People can see through a façade of feigned interest, so pretending will get you nowhere. To create a deep connection with someone, you have to actually get to know them and in turn allow them to get to know you.

A robust relationship will lead to further connections. When you meet people, ask meaningful questions and truly listen to their responses. Allow them to talk about themselves before you do and stay focused and present during your conversation. Nothing ruins a genuine connection faster than being distracted during your initial conversation.

A desire to help others.

No one gains anything from being selfish. One perk of having a robust and well developed network is being able to use it, but not just for your own personal gains. Share your network with those inside of it, and your good deeds will come back to you full circle.

Connect people within your network who you think would mutually benefit each other. If you’ve got a friend who’s looking for career advice and you have a career coach in your network, offer to make an introduction. The possibilities are endless, and by paying it forward you’ll stay at the forefront of those people’s minds. If the opportunity arises, they’ll return the favor by making a new connection for you as well.

Highly connected people know that it can take time for opportunities to arise. They’re invested in the long term and aren’t deterred by setbacks in the short term. Building their network didn’t happen overnight, and they know that opportunities don’t often happen that quickly either.

Don’t get frustrated when you reach out to someone in your network and don’t hear back from them. It’s easy to lose patience when you’ve asked someone in your network to make a connection for you. There are a number of reasons that it might be taking a while – the person they reached out to might not be getting back to them or they could be extremely busy at work.

It takes time to cultivate and build a network, but that investment pays off because you’re creating a foundation for the future. A person you meet today could help you out tomorrow, a month from now, or in three years. Building quality connections now will always serve you well in the future. Know that the proverbial seeds you’re planting now will grow eventually, it just might take longer than you anticipated and hoped.

An emphasis on quality over quantity.

It’s not about the size of your network, but the quality of connections within it. Quality connections are worth a hundred times more in value than in quantity. If you have a highly connected, active network of 50 people, chances are they’re more engaged with each other. When a network increases in size, you tend to see more people as passive, rather than active participants.

This isn’t to say that you shouldn’t have a large network, but that you should focus on building quality connections rather than simply trying to connect with every single person you meet. It’s alright if you don’t make quality connections at every event you attend. Building a network takes time, patience, and dedication.

Anyone can become a highly connected person with the right mindset. When these traits become habits, you’ll start to see your network develop and flourish.",None
"If your New Year is incomplete without a resolution or two, here are 12 - one for each month of the year - that you can pick and choose from.

Don't forget that Leadership is about the way you lead your life, over and above leading people, so these have a personal aspect as well as a collective one.

1. Do Less Be More - we are constantly bombarded with messages to be more productive, more efficient and do more with less. The reality is that a balance between activity and rest makes us more productive and more relaxed. If you can't achieve that balance, you are the cause, nothing and no-one else.

2. Delegate With Trust - delegating activity is easy: just tell someone what to do and how to do it. But delegating activity and responsibility - relinquishing your control - is another matter. Micromanagement is, in essence, a retention of trust - and if you're employing people you can't trust, you have some questions to answer.

3. Live The Culture You Want - aspiring to a positive, healthy organisational culture is a good thing. But expecting it to happen through instruction and initiative is asinine. If you want your company culture to change, you have to change your behaviour first. Then, and only then, will others follow suit.

4. Don't Rely On Intellect Alone - if you believe your decisions are logical, you are sadly mistaken. Intellect is just one of the faculties available to us. Improve your decision-making capabilities by developing your intuition - the ability to understand something instinctively, without the need for conscious reasoning.

5. Get Integrated - Integrity is about being complete and whole and has practical implications over ethical ones. Make sure that you're not compartmentalising behaviours: doing things in one sphere that you would never do in another. Remember that someone is always watching - that someone is you.

6. Live On Purpose - living 'on purpose' means loving what you do and doing what you love. It's not a luxury, it's a birthright. But it's also a choice, so if you've settled for less, now is the time to make some changes. The #1 Deathbed Regret is: I wish I'd had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me.

7. Focus On Sowing Not Reaping - too many of us fixate on outcomes and results which, ironically, are things we have very little control over. And we neglect things we can control - the causes. Commercially this means focus obsessively on delivering your value, and the rewards will look after themselves.

8. Respect Your Limits - this is all about knowing the boundaries of your control and responsibility. When you control something you are not responsible for, the result is interference and micromanagement (see 2.). When you take responsibility for something you have no control over, the result is failure (see 7.)

9. Cut Out The Small Talk - perhaps one of the most damaging and wasteful activities that many take part in is idle chatter, which frequently involves criticism of another. If the criticism is valid, involve the other person. If not, refuse to take part and walk away. Your example as leader is critical.

10. Get Balanced - work/rest is not the only balance we need to establish. We need our fair share of art, music, nature, exercise, friends, family and fun to name a few. If you believe you don't have time to get the balance right then you are a victim of your work and not a leader. Stop making excuses and see 11.

11. Invoke Nike - the ultimate antidote to prevarication - Just Do It - can cut through mountains of justifications for not taking action. Sometimes it's not about waiting to make the right decision, it's about acting and making it right. Is it coincidence that the $90 billion company is named after the goddess of victory?

12. Meditate Daily - if you want to accelerate your evolution as a leader, you need to accelerate your development as a person. There is no more effective way of doing this than sitting for a few minutes everyday and observing your inner dynamics. Never mind all the science around meditation, see 11. and just do it.",wellness
"In less than two years, Borges transformed her frustration into a product that retailed at Target, Bed Bath & Beyond, Cost Plus, Cracker Barrel, and on Amazon this holiday season. How? By licensing her improved gift bag -- which features scalloped tissue paper built in -- to the global design powerhouse IG Design Group. The tissue paper in her GoGo Gift Bags is easily 'bloomed' for an attractive appearance.

Her success illustrates the many benefits of partnering with a market leader when you have a hit on your hands. For example, speed to market and shelf space. Another? Line extensions. Earlier this year, professional sports-themed GoGo Gift Bags hit the market as a result of her licensee's existing relationships. Her licensee has also helped her address copycats and knockoffs.

Borges holds up her end of their partnership, and then some. She's a very savvy user of social media. On her Facebook page, satisfied customers regularly tag her in posts expressing their joy and appreciation. She runs contests, generously supports other entrepreneurs, and expresses her gratitude openly. It's no wonder others want to champion her. She's also garnered major press, including from The Today Show.

This year's rollout was seamless and expansive. Unlike last year, GoGo Gift Bags had additional placement at the checkout lanes at Target, in addition to secondary placement in their seasonal Wondershop. We also increased our online presence with Amazon! So many consumers use online shopping -- sometimes exclusively -- to purchase their holiday gifts, so we're now reaching those same consumers with the GoGo.

Last year was a first for many consumers to use a GoGo Gift Bag, and this year they recognized the brand name and product benefits. We saw sales hit as soon as GoGo bags were available in stores and online in November.

Many of our programs are seasonally based, so we were excited about the expanded retail presence this year. We also have retail placement year-round at gift and specialty retailers and select professional sports team shops around the nation. Amazon has provided us with another fantastic sales outlet in order to reach those consumers that prefer online shopping. What's great overall is that we have GoGo Gift Bags across multiple brands within IG Design Group, including LANG, The Gift Wrap Company, Turner Sports and IG, allowing an extensive GoGo Gift Bag assortment.

The GoGo Gift Bag partnership with Jimmy the Bull was an expansion of the collaboration LANG already has with Rafael. They have a whole Jimmy the Bull product line, and it was a great fit for us to fold the GoGo Gift Bags into this collaboration.

The sports-themed GoGo Gift Bags are also an expansion of the collaboration with Turner, one of the LANG Company's primary brands. They have an existing, comprehensive professional sports and collegiate product offering. In a similar fashion to Jimmy the Bull, it was a natural fit for us to fold the GoGo Gift Bags into sports. Turner leveraged existing relationships with their dated goods license to expand into the gift bag category.

I am in close contact with my licensee. We have a great working relationship that has evolved into more than just a partnership... more of a friendship. I've mentioned it on social media how much they mean to me. They helped bring my dreams to life! I approach business much in the same manner as any other relationship: It has to be mutually beneficial and with open communication. I have that with IG Design Group, and it's one of the reasons I chose them over anyone else for my licensing partnership.

The GoGo Gift Bag intellectual property is strong with several patents, and my partnership with IG Design Group provides me with the means to back it! Though we have noticed that some competitors have simply styled and propped their bags with tissue that appears to mimic the look of a GoGo Gift Bag, this styling is only for photography purposes and isn't what the consumer actually receives. Styling a gift bag is something consumers don't want to have to do, as it's a hassle! Part of what makes GoGo Gift Bag so special is that it styles itself and is still the only gift bag that does.

Our plan for 2019 is continuous new product/artwork launches and distribution expansion. Many of the retail buyers are meeting with us now to discuss placement for other occasions such as birthdays, Mother's Day and Valentine's Day. We are looking forward to a great year!

I think it's in my blood to hustle so losing the vision in my left eye this year has only made my view on business and life that much clearer. I'll always have a vision for GoGo Gift Bag, and that vision is what keeps me driven, even when life throws an unexpected curveball. It's about staying consistent.",None
"This is a story about a smaller restaurant chain trolling McDonald's, Burger King, and other giants of the business. And it's kind of brilliant. Before the details, a quick explanation.

The fast food industry is a smart and fun one to follow no matter what business you're in, and for two big reasons.

First, there's the pure scale. Make a menu change at McDonald's for example, and you're upending the routines of hundreds of thousands of hungry Americans. You can learn a lot just by watching how they develop and test new products.

Think of McDonald's, which spends $2 billion a year on marketing and ads. That's half the entire value of its much smaller competitor, Wendy's. It's an incredible chance just to unpack what they do, and figure out why they think that various ideas will work.

I wrote about one of them recently, which I completely love: a discount offered within the Burger King mobile app that lets you order a Burger King Whopper for only 1 cent.

The only catch? You had to place the order from a McDonald's restaurant. (Technically, just being within 600 feet was close enough to trigger the offer.)

Of course, Burger King isn't small; just smaller than McDonald's. But it shows how if you're creative, you can use a competitor's strength--in that case the fact that there are roughly twice as many McDonald's in the U.S. than there are Burger King locations--to your advantage.

But what if you don't have 1.7 million Twitter followers and a full time social media marketing operation, like Burger King, to get word of your deal out.?

What if you don't even have a mobile app (or a burning desire to get people to download your app, which is what the Burger King promotion and so many others these days are all about)?

Again: not exactly tiny, although very small compared to McDonald's and Burger King. Smoothie King has close to 800 stores, heavily concentrated in warmer weather parts of the country.

It's privately held, and even if you've never tried it, you might recognize the name from the $40 million naming deal it has for the NBA New Orleans Pelicans home arena (""Smoothie King Center"").

Now, like its bigger competitors, Smoothie King also has a rewards app, and it's launched a contest to try to incentivize people to download and use it. (The ""Change-a-Meal Challenge."")

McDonald's did the same thing with its Gold Card/Free McDonald's for Life contest, and Starbucks had a ""get Starbucks for life"" contest. Heck, that was the point--beyond pure trolling--of the Burger King 1-cent Whopper promotion.

But what attracted me to this whole thing is how Smoothie King is kicking off its promotion: By letting you use any coupon from any other fast food restaurant -- McDonald's or Burger King included -- at Smoothie King.

It's good for only one day, New Year's Eve, and regardless of the competitor's coupon's value, it gets you $2 off a smoothie at Smoothie King on December 31.

And in truth, I don't know how many people would take advantage of it. But that doesn't really matter in a way; what matters in this social media age is whether you can find a truthful, fun way to troll your competitors and turn their strengths to your advangage.",None
"Though the bulk of the holiday madness is behind us, many leaders are still in need of a vacation, or maybe a vacation from their vacation. If you're a CEO, an executive, or anyone leading a high-impact team, the holidays can be stressful as your projects and problems from the past year converge with your need to prepare for the year ahead. Top that with the worthwhile but acute stressors of family time, holiday event planning, and gift-buying, and you have a recipe for a rocky end to the year.

The lack of ability to relax and recoup during the holidays can spell bad news for leaders, as the energy you have going into the new year will only wane as time goes on. If you're already out of steam, your ability to motivate your team and make sharp decisions will worsen, and it will be a challenge to climb out of that funk in the busiest parts of the year. If the most recent holidays weren't restful and you're still not up to speed at work, here's how to tackle your stress level going into the new year.

Focus On What's On Your Plate Now

If there are large challenges looming over your head and keeping you from looking forward to 2019, now is the time to tackle them.  It's tempting to look ahead or to feel guilty diverting your attention from friends and family at this time of the year, but if a work-related issue is taking up half of your brain, your attention is already divided. In order to move forward, you need to get the highest-impact tasks for 2018 out of the way.

Make a to-do list ranked by priority. The best-case scenario is that everything on the list is entirely within your control, but if some of it involves others on your team who are in and out of the office for the holidays, do your part and set a due date in early January to have the matter resolved. To give your future self a leg-up, set a deadline for big projects in 2019 well before the holidays to avoid running down to the wire again.

Once the biggest distractions from work are off the table, steer clear of career-related activities until you've had a chance to rest with family, friends, or even by yourself. Turn on your out-of-office notification for once and feel the relief of not having to constantly check and respond to email. Short trips out of town or time spent at home give your brain distance from work to take stock of your life, personally and professionally. They also allow time for you to enjoy hobbies that keep your brain active in positive ways and exercise your all-important creativity.

The key to truly enjoying your vacation time is to let go of expectations and pressure on yourself to balance work and personal time perfectly. Once you've completed your most pressing work, no matter how long it took, put it out of your mind and focus on time specifically with your loved ones and for taking care of yourself. It's the quality of the time, not the quantity, that makes an impact.

Planning for the future is far more enjoyable when the work of the past is done and you feel up-to-date with your family, friends, and yourself. Once you've wrapped up 2018 and taken a breather away from work, it's time to vision-plan. What do you want for your company in the coming year? Were there mistakes you made last year that you want to nip in the bud early this year? How are you going to communicate your vision to your team? Take time at home or in your office to answer these questions and create a big-picture, but precise plan for 2019.

Even if holidays were more stressful than cheerful, you can still finish strong for the year. Stay focused on what's most critical, at work and at home, and you'll be able to start 2019 with a clear head and plenty of energy.",wellness

"History was made on Friday, December 21, by Rise, a 30 Under 30-founded nonprofit advocating civil rights for sexual assault survivors. The team celebrated a crucial accomplishment: their lobbied Sexual Assault Survivors' Bill of Rights was signed into law by New York’s Governor Andrew Cuomo. Amanda Nguyen, Forbes 30 Under 30 alumni and 2019 Nobel Peace Prize nominee, is the founder and CEO of the organization responsible for the legislation. “This bill represents 6.8 million survivors receiving basic civil rights and equality under the law,” says Nguyen. “For many of our Risers who were betrayed by a broken criminal justice system, it means the closest thing to closure and justice they will ever experience.”

Due to the new law, it will now be required for law enforcement officials to inform victims on their set of rights in the state of New York. These rights will include making sure cases are suitably reported, appropriate health care will be provided at no cost, counseling services are available and survivors will have the ability to request information on their sexual offense evidence kit from state officials. Rape kit retention has also been increased from 30 days to 20 years.

Nguyen says that this policy has been long overdue. “New York was once the worst state in the nation for survivors’ rights: destroying rape kits after only 30 days, not providing trauma-informed medical staff following a sexual assault, not notifying survivors of their rights. Now, New York will serve as a model for our campaigns in 2019 and, hopefully, inspire other legislators to adopt this bill in their states.”

In a statement released last Friday, Governor Cuomo referred to the legislation as a step forward in the state’s work to combat sexual harassment and assault while delivering justice to survivors. Cuomo went on to condemn the federal government’s stance on sexual assault via social media. “As the federal government shamefully ignores the voices of sexual assault survivors, New York is taking strong steps to empower survivors,” he stated, in a series of tweets that followed the signing.

Rise has been hard at work fighting for this measure to be ratified in every state ever since the Obama administration signed the federal bill into effect on October 7, 2016. Survivors and allies spread across the U.S. have been lobbying using the organizing model “Hope-a-nomics”—a grassroots campaign that educates on existing rights and the lawmaking process while encouraging sustainable change in communities—to see the bill into state legislation. They’ve also had international success initiating change in Canada, Japan, Jordan and the Republic of Kenya. “The New York campaign has been a two-year process with extraordinary wins. Rise, and the incredible team of Risers, shared their personal testimonies, worked alongside Assembly members and Senators to pass the bill unanimously and negotiated for the strongest language before the final bill was sent to the Governor’s desk.”

Their journey has been arduous, but Nguyen stresses how eminently rewarding it is to see this legislation passed in New York. This is Rise’s 20th law adopted from the federal bill officiated in the organization’s four-year run, making this victory a substantial milestone for the cofounder and her team. She calls it:  “The best Christmas present ever!”

What’s next for Rise as they continue to push this movement forward? They’ve set their sights on getting adaptions of the Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights passed in as many states as possible in 2019. “We are already making progress in Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Indiana, Louisiana, Missouri, Minnesota, New Mexico, Nevada, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Wisconsin.” Influencing beyond national borders is another aim, as they also hope to pass a global resolution before the United Nations General Assembly.",None
"Absurdly Driven looks at the world of business with a skeptical eye and a firmly rooted tongue in cheek.

He's wearing a smock to a party. Ergo, no way am talking to him.

Just how judgmental are we?

How long do we give each other to make a good first impression before we move on?

The researchers discovered that you have 27 seconds to make a good first impression.

This is far more generous than I would have imagined.

It seems to me that people dismiss others after just one look. Or even just one sniff.

Indeed, these researchers insisted that smell was an extremely important factor.

85 percent of respondents said they were more likely to have a good first impression about someone is they were pleasantly fragrant.

One should, of course, toss a little skepticism into every piece of research.

This one was performed on behalf of the Dollar Shave Club, which just happens to have launched some new colognes.

"When President Trump signed the massive, last minute tax overhaul last year (literally on the Friday before the Christmas weekend), it changed the U.S. Tax Code, big time.

Whoops. Here's the law, the completely logical thing it prompted Apple to do (and that backfired), and what it all tells us about how last-minute laws can lead to unintended consequences.

For most people and companies, the new tax law should ultimately lead to more money. But it's complicated, and we'll know more for sure next month, after people start filing their 2018 tax returns.

Still, we've already seen that this law, which was negotiated in secret last year and then passed on party lines in the last few days of the Congressional session, brought with it some real quirks and missteps.

For example, ultra-wealthy families almost didn't qualify for massive tax breaks they expected, due to what seems like an unnoticed drafting error. (The IRS came to their rescue last month.)

And some married couples in troubled relationships were racing to get divorced by Dec. 31, because the new tax law completely reverses the way alimony was treated for tax purposes.

The one group that should have been relentlessly cheering this tax law however was big corporations, since they got a massive tax break.

And they are getting it--but it seems that the tax savings led some companies to do a completely logical thing that ultimately didn't work -- and wound up losing a ton of money in the process. (The biggest name among them: Apple.)

The populist argument in favor of big corporate tax breaks is that the money will ultimately find its way to workers and investors, in the form of higher salaries and dividends.

In fact, as many clear-eyed observers predicted, big public companies are answerable to their shareholders, so they have a duty to do things that are reasonably calculated to increase the value of their stock. One classic way to do that: buy back your own stock.

It's an especially attractive option when companies are nervous about what the economy will look like down the road. So, instead of higher wages or investments, that's exactly what a lot of companies did in 2018.

But of course, this strategy only works if your stock continues to increase in value as you buy more of it. And in the case of Apple and some other companies that bet big on this strategy, it's been a bit of a disaster. As the Journal reports:

Apple Inc. has lost more than $9 billion this year on an underperforming investment--its own stock. Like many large companies, Apple has used much of its windfall from the 2017 tax overhaul to buy back shares. But the recent plunge in stock prices has made that look like a bad idea. Apple and companies including Wells Fargo & Co., Citigroup Inc. and Applied Materials Inc. repurchased their own shares at rich prices, only to see their value decline sharply. In effect, the market has told them they overpaid by billions of dollars.

It's okay to laugh

And even if it doesn't rebound, it still was arguably a good move from a shareholder's perspective, if you believe that Apple's stock value would have lost even more than $9 billion without the buyback.

Although, could Apple have done something better with that $9 billion? Maybe, design the next wave of products that might usher in yet another generation of dominance? We're deep into the realm of the theoretical now.",None
"Every person on this planet is looking for two things--happiness and  . But as much as we might wish it, the desire to achieve   and find joy isn't enough to manifest these things in our lives.

Grit isn't just an empty platitude thrown around by self-styled self-help gurus. The power of dedication and perseverance is actually backed up by scientific research. In fact, University of Pennsylvania psychologist and MacArthur Foundation ""genius"" grant winner Angela Duckworth believes grit gives a better indication of a child's possible future success and happiness than even his or her IQ score -- and her research backs it up.

Grit comes down to two things: passion and perseverance for long-term goals. Duckworth's study of West Point cadets found that these two attributes were the strongest predictors of a candidate's future success--well beyond reaction times, physical ability, and overall knowledge.

This is an insight that has shaped my interactions with my own kids. In an effort to ensure they live happy, successful lives, I try to instill in them that dedication and focus they need to achieve their goals--motivating, not pushing.

After all, if you rely on outside motivation (i.e., pushing) to convince you to take some action, you won't know whether it's the right thing to do. Self-awareness is key to success, and self-awareness plus grit is the ultimate winning combination. Grit is that little speck of sand inside the oyster that turns into a pearl.

It's great to know the value of grit, but how do we acquire it? Developing this passion and perseverance comes down to just three simple mantras:

1. ""I don't wait to 'find' my passions; I cultivate them.""

If grit is equal parts passion and perseverance, then finding one's passion would seem to be the grit seeker's job No. 1. Not so, say psychologists from Stanford University and Yale-NUS College in Singapore. In a recent study, they found that those study participants who considered their passions ""fixed"" and just waiting to be discovered were likely to give up on a new interest when it became too challenging to master easily.

Instead of hoping that your passion will simply reveal itself eventually, adopt what the study's authors call a ""growth mindset."" Experiment with a variety of activities--and expect slow going at first. Only by putting in active effort will you discover whether a passing fancy could become an all-consuming love.

Grit isn't just about being a hard worker. It's about digging in and finding meaning in what you do--especially as it relates to helping others. The conviction that our work matters can help build habits, encourage forward momentum, and provide the motivation necessary to overcome obstacles.

With a focus on the meaning behind our work, we no longer just have a job. We have a calling. If you asked me what I'm doing at this exact moment, I could say, ""I'm writing an article,"" ""I'm educating others,"" or ""I'm instilling in others a drive to pursue their goals."" The third extends beyond the superficial and into the realm of true conviction.

Keep in mind that purpose won't appear overnight. You need to pursue and create your purpose. To do this, try remembering why you work. Are you passionate about what your company accomplishes? Is your work helping to support people you care about? Take time to reflect and consider how your work is contributing to something bigger than yourself.

People with grit have a hope that's based on drive and making things happen rather than mere luck. ""Grit depends on a different kind of hope,"" Duckworth explains in her book, Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance. ""It rests on the expectation that our own efforts can improve our future. I have a feeling tomorrow will be better is different from I resolve to make tomorrow better.""

Part of working toward a long-term goal is understanding that speed bumps, obstacles, and failures are inevitable parts of the journey. By embracing these as specific learning opportunities that strengthen our resolve and our ability to succeed as we continue forward, it allows us to achieve even greater success. Hope can turn setbacks into stepping-stones that help us reach greater heights. Learning to bounce back from failure can help you develop this unique type of hope.",None
"Words matter. Words are powerful. Yehuda Berg says, “Words are singularly the most powerful force available to humanity. We can choose to use this force constructively with words of encouragement, or destructively using words of despair. Words have energy and power with the ability to help, to heal, to hinder, to hurt, to harm, to humiliate and to humble.” Yet, in truth, we rarely understand the influence our words have on others and especially on ourselves.

Without words, our thoughts cannot become reality. Words describe our mood, our opinions, and our emotions. They enable us to communicate with others and build relationships. And perhaps most importantly, we use words to describe to ourselves who we are and our future path. In this way, I believe words have their ultimate power in influencing a life of positivity or one of difficulty and despair.

For example, casually we may describe ourselves as lazy, forgetful, unattractive, over the hill and a whole litany of negative adjectives, unaware that in doing so we diminish ourselves and deflate our egos and confidence. These adjectives rob us of our power and influence. Yet we have a choice, a very powerful choice, to instead choose words that empower us and support us in creating a successful career and fulfilling life.  Yes, it all starts with our thoughts and choice of words.

In my own life, I realized that the story I was telling myself about who I am was the biggest obstacle I had to having the career and life I wanted. I made a conscious choice to shed the debilitating words that caused me pain and worry, and to replace them with words of joy and abundance and love. My life changed dramatically.

I started to recognize with my coaching clients that their stories about themselves were also holding them back from reaching their full potential. I gave them an exercise to write a new story for themselves; a positive, empowering story about who they are and how they’re feeling in that new mindset. I began to witness their transformation. Their new choice of words fueled their ambition and success.

As this year comes to a close, many of us are reminded to take stock of the past 365 days, reflect, and establish goals or intentions for the upcoming year. I advise you to take another path as this year ends and reflect on the story you currently tell yourself about who you are. Is it serving you? If not, what would you like your new story to be?

In as much detail as possible, describe your new story in first person, ‘I am….’ What type of work are you doing? How do you feel doing that work? What are your relationships like with your family and friends and significant other? What do you want them to be? How does that feel? Choose your words wisely for the feeling they create and find those adjectives that give you joy and confidence.

As you write this story, don’t jump to solutions. Don’t concern yourself with how things will happen but stay in the positive space and welcome in the good feelings that accompany the new story. And, most importantly, don’t immediately judge the story as impossible. Stay with it. Stay with the positive powerful emotions until you finish writing it. And then read it out loud every day.

It’s the beginning of a new year and can be the beginning of a more powerful and joyful you!

"The new year 2019 is right around the corner. Many of us are setting goals for 2019. Before you do that, take time to step back. Get a new perspective on 2018 so you can set more authentic and meaningful goals for 2019. Here are the self-reflection questions I am asking myself and sharing with my executive coaching clients.

If this year were a movie, what happened?

The idea of this question is to help you get yourself out of your usual perspective (the main character) and watch what happened as an observer. Describe the year as you would if you were sharing the story of a movie. Describe the characters in the movie (including yourself) and what happened from their perspective. You might even engage them in the exercise. It helps you get a meta view and notice things that you hadn’t seen before.

For example, as I wrote this movie narrative, I realized that life has been messy, challenging, and full of change this year. I come away with a greater appreciation for my resilience in dealing with change and challenge than I had before. I also have a better perspective on how important people in my life experienced this year.

What worked well that I’m grateful for?

As I asked this question of a friend, he realized that he hadn’t taken the step back to recognize all that had gone well, what he had created, and how he had grown. When you ask yourself what you feel grateful for, you discover more deeply what matters to you. This helps you set more authentic goals for the coming year. As you do this, take the time to actually savor what you feel grateful for.

What was challenging or disappointing?

This question helps you acknowledge what was hard and be in touch with any emotion associated with it. For example, when I asked an executive coaching client this question, she realized that one of the most challenging aspects of the year was negative feedback from her boss. She’s a top-performer and felt frustrated: “No matter how hard I try, I’m never good enough!” As she said this, tears welled up. She got in touch with her anger and hurt. This resentment she had felt toward her boss had eroded trust in their relationship.

After she processed the emotion, in our next session she was able to get a more balanced perspective: she has development opportunities, she also has strengths that help her be successful, and she had taken her boss’ feedback too personally. She realized that in 2019 she wants to work on growing her confidence in herself. If she had avoided getting in touch with emotion, she would have missed the opportunity for greater insight about herself. As you do this exercise be sure to be compassionate with yourself.

What were my most meaningful moments?

Getting in touch with what is meaningful and re-living the moments that mattered this year helps you bring into greater focus where you want to spend your time and energy in the coming year.

Where did I spend my time and energy?

As you review the year, take a look at where you spent your precious time and energy. Does this reflect what matters to you? Many of us spend our time in distraction. As you look to next year, what do you want to spend more energy on and what less?

Where did I fail? What did I learn?

Acknowledging our failures without letting them define who we are is a great act of courage. It helps us fully accept ourselves as we are, see ourselves more clearly, and be more open to feedback from others. It helps us learn and grow. My friend and colleague Whitney Johnson asks “Did I do my best?”. We often have lots of goals we want to pursue and simply asking ourselves did we do our best helps us acknowledge our failures with compassion.

Looking back overall, how do I rate my happiness on a scale of 1-10?

This is a question that my friend Dorie Clark asks every month. She recommends digging deeper to ask yourself what’s contributing to the rating, and continuing to dig so you understand what habits or choices (often unconscious) may be contributing. For example, when I asked myself this question, I gave myself a seven. As I dug deeper, I realized that I undermine my satisfaction when I over-commit myself, often thinking about what’s next, and don’t take the time to pause and appreciate what’s here. As I set goals for 2019, I am deliberately making a list of projects I will let go of.

As I look to next year, what will be the highest use of my talents?

This is a great question to take stock of your talents and take a step back to notice where they can be most useful. The question invites us to choose where we will spend our energies in the coming year that will serve the purposes that matter to us.

What is an area where I will exercise courage to stretch, grow and learn next year?

This is a great question my friend Kathy Caprino encourages us all to ask. She is passionate about helping us all “find brave”, and set goals that will inspire us to move beyond our comfort zone.

What does success look like to me next year?

As you review meaningful domains in your life (e.g. professional, personal relationships, health & well-being etc.) create a clear vision of what success is in each domain. Prioritize what’s important. And (mostly a reminder to myself), don’t bite off more than you can chew!

Whether you start with one question or attempt all ten, I recommend you take the time to jot down your own answers so 2019 can be a year of greater purpose and fulfillment for you.",None
"It’s almost midnight, the band plays, and the waiter pours. The bubbling foam atop your fluted glass previews what lies below—lovely champagne to cheer your heart and soul.

But what if your friendly waiter simply served you the froth on top? No way to toast the New Year, is it?

Don’t make the same mistake with your  leadership development in 2019. Look past the foamy bubbles of today’s fads, to the essence hiding below: the timeless core of what leadership is, and what you must always do to build it throughout your career.

But it's easy to get distracted. The leadership development industry has exploded in recent years, and, alas, there’s more than enough froth to confuse any aspiring professional. Too much shallow or gimmicky advice: about quick digital solutions, magical time management, secret leadership sauces, metaphors from history or Shakespeare, breathless predictions about the “completely new future.”

Abandon the ephemera. Build your capability on five fundamental principles:

1. Aim at what “leadership” really is. “Leader” has come to mean too many things—someone with an imposing title, or upper box on the org chart; or someone who simply challenges authority to stand apart from the crowd; or your eager-beaver colleagues who keep raising their hands for  extra assignments. Cut to the core! If you want to build leadership, keep your aim on what leaders achieve: they create significant impact by building an organization of people working together on big common goals.

2. Leaders worry about motivating and aligning  people, not specific structures of organization. Leaders achieve impact by mobilizing followers to get something done. The context for that can take many  forms: a corporation (e.g. a big or small for-profit business); an extended enterprise (e.g. Amazon and its ecosystem of suppliers and sellers); a network (e.g. communities of open software developers or affiliated non-profit agencies); or a movement (e.g. armies of volunteers who followed Martin Luther King's civil rights initiatives). Leaders also create impact in smaller-scale ways, e.g. with a team, a partnership or some other unit within a larger organization. What ultimately matters is not the form or structure, but how leaders assemble the necessary talent, and coordinate and inspire people so they can achieve major goals together.

3. “Management” is not a dirty word. The collective work of the team, corporation, network or enterprise doesn’t have to flow only from a leader’s hands-on direction; great leaders also drive results through indirect or intangible means with followers—appealing to purpose, building cultures of commitment and performance, encouraging others to take leadership on their own accord.

But achieving impact with any kind of organization always requires some management too. For decades, business academics have argued that leaders are different from managers, prompting too many would-be leaders to shirk from overseeing (or even engaging in) operational activity. Don’t get hung up on the labels, and be willing to step into some everyday real work. If you’re going to have impact with an organization, you have to develop enough experience to sometimes manage others. And doing so, by the way, also builds better judgment for you to hire and guide others who sometimes provide management for you. Leadership must be more than just having big thoughts or making motivational speeches at all-company meetings.

4. Build your leadership by on-the-job experience with critical organizational practices. You have to get good at a lot of things to be a successful leader—but start by prioritizing your development around a short list of must-do’s. Here are five fundamental practices that are always part of driving impact through organization. (“Practices” because you build  knowledge and skills hands-on, reflecting and improving over time.)

5. Practice also “leading yourself."" Many leadership books emphasize what might be a sixth practice—focusing on what you do for yourself ""to be a leader,” e.g. building your character, understanding what’s important to you, developing certain “leadership behaviors,” etc.  Those aren’t wrong—but don’t get too buried in yourself. Keep your leadership focused on energizing the broader organization that will lead to major impact.

So, structure your self-care around four themes, to make it most effective for both you and your enterprise:

Come January 1, make your leadership development resolution on the simple metaphor of that glass of New Year’s champagne: “Yes, I will enjoy some occasional froth, but only as a complement to the real wine below. I’ll keep my focus on the enduring fundamentals of  impact, practicing the practices that have always moved organizations and leaders towards their common goals.”",None
"It’s the same every year – “this is the year I’m going to leave on time every night,” or “this is the year I’m going to read a new book every week,” we tell ourselves every January the first, filled with optimism that the new year will be the one where everything changes. Sometimes we’re right – especially if we’ve mentally prepared ourselves for the goals we’ve set – but, more often than not, life gets in the way.

It’s common knowledge that one of the reasons most resolutions die a pitiful death the second week in January is that we usually fall into the trap of setting goals that are too big. A little like “statistical numbing” –the idea that humans have a greater emotional response to one, rather than wide-spread, tragedy – we find it difficult to wholly get on board with goals that will take a long time to reach.

We need something to work towards in order to motivate ourselves to go to work every day, though. The good news is, there are plenty of small goals we can set ourselves that can actually make a big difference to our working life and career as a whole.

Here are a few ideas to get the ball rolling.",None
"Budget allocation, generational divide and legacy programming of learning and development initiatives are the three obstacles stopping companies from adapting digital transformation, according to a survey of more than 1,000 learning and development (L&D) professionals, by AVADO.

The research found that about half of the respondents reported that only C-suite employees or the board are included in their company’s digital transformation. This not only excludes learning and development leaders but also HR and input from other employees. The C-suite dominates digital transformation decision-making but businesses rarely bring in HR/L&D before the digital transformation roll-out. Eighty-four percent of all decisions on HR and L&D budget are made by the C-suite and only 35% of businesses had the foresight to bring in HR/L&D in advance of digital transformation programs.

Many companies are already extremely late in preparation for ongoing digital transformation, said Niall McKinney, global president of AVADO.

“If L&D programs are implemented swiftly and supported by C-suite executives, they can effectively upscale workforces and decrease job loss due to outdated skills and inability to grow alongside technology.”

There is also a generational divide when it comes to prioritizing digital transformation, the survey found. People aged over 55 are often in C-suite and leadership roles at organizations that require change but this demographic doesn’t yet fully embrace and support the transformation process. The survey revealed that 95% of 25 to 44-year-olds believe transformation is important, only 72% of those in the 55 plus age range cite the same enthusiasm. For those who have yet started programs, more than 60% of those polled, don’t plan to implement in the future.

The survey also reveals that the impact on small business jobs (SMBs) in rural populations is potentially very damaging. SMBs are the largest category of business size that have no digital transformation program at nearly 20%, compared to 10% of larger enterprises. SMBs without leadership programs are also the least likely to build out these programs in the future.",None

"If you want to improve your capacity to manage heated, emotionally charged conversations, start by mindfully taking care of your own emotional needs. It may sound counterintuitive to focus on yourself when you need to gain alignment with others, but nothing could be further from the truth. It is crucial to be aware of your feelings and thoughts and the impact they have on others as the emotions that you are experiencing -- and exhibiting -- are transmissible to others. This is often referred to as ""emotional contagion.""

When strong emotions arise, there is the event or conversation that triggered the strong emotions (the stimulus) and then there is the response that follows (such as avoidance, anger, sadness, etc.) What dwells between stimulus and response is choice. You choose the way in which you will respond. This brief ""window of choice"" can be narrow and there are, of course, times when your emotions feel as though they are way ahead of your thinking. The human brain is designed to be reactive in nature and the fight or flight mechanism is very strong, leading you to experience a wide variety of physical sensations geared to prepare you for action. The problem is, this default response cannot tell the difference between a lion chasing you, versus getting involved in a heated political conversation. The same chemicals are being released in your body -- which is why it is essential to have a set of self-regulation tools at your disposal.

Below are four effective regulatory skills. Use them when strong emotions, such as anger, frustration or anxiousness begin to take over. With practice, you will build a reserve of emotional resilience that can be called upon when needed. Although each person differs in the amount of resilience they have (some is genetic, and some is built through life experiences), anyone can improve their emotional resilience through focused and sustained effort.

Pay attention to your breathing. Simply focusing on your breath and slowing down your inhaling and exhaling takes you out of your head and into the body. If you stay in your head, you are likely to get emotionally hijacked. Take long, slow, deep breaths, before moving forward with the discussion.

It is helpful to deflect attention or energy away from yourself and on to someone or something else. This also will buy you some time to calm down. Ask questions, take notes or redirect your gaze from the person you are speaking to, onto an object or place in the room.

It is not always possible to manage your feelings in the moment. If required, consider delaying the conversation altogether. The delay could be for several minutes, hours or even a few days.

If you are in a stressful business meeting, be sure to plan for frequent breaks. Another way to mitigate stress is to match the work environment to the type of work being done. Taking the problem outside of a stressful environment may contribute to a more creative and mutually amenable outcome. Finally, remember that the way you regulate your emotions and manage your moods will have a significant impact on the quality of your work and ultimately, your relationships.",None
"Management is nothing if not a results-oriented endeavor. Successful managers deliver results. You can be the best-liked manager in your company, but if you don't deliver solid results you'll likely struggle in the role. With results in mind, here are four fundamentals that can make you a stronger manager this year.

Focus on accountability. Much as you might think that accountability - holding people ""accountable"" for the results you need to deliver - is simply a given, it's not. Accountability isn't easy; it involves close management and sometimes conflict. Data shows that many managers, even senior managers (46% in one study), are surprisingly weak at accountability. Making a point of focusing on it - knowing exactly what results are needed and managing to them - will enhance your effectiveness in the role.

Increase public confidence. The whole idea of ""performing"" well in public - for instance, giving a presentation or speech or running a meeting - can be a highly stressful part of management. Yet it's a highly valuable part as well. Handling these public aspects of management confidently can be critical to career success. The more you advance in an organization, the more you have to ""sell"" your ideas. Everyone respects a great speaker... and great speakers are made, not born (just ask Warren Buffett, among many others). Making this an area of diligent focus can increase your influence - and boost your managerial career.

Emphasize preparation. This point is directly related to the one above. I won't go deep into the weeds here, as there are many excellent systems to help with gaining speaking and presenting confidence. But suffice to say, they all involve preparation and practice. Lots of it. In my own experience, I can't tell you how many presentations I gave in my car while I was driving to or from work... or quietly at night with an ironing board as a podium in my basement while my wife and kids were asleep. Not memorizing so much as getting comfortable with content. Some people may be talented enough to succeed in public without practice, but I for sure wasn't one of them. How well I performed (and it is a performance, make no mistake about it) was directly related to how well I knew my material. With diligent preparation at the core of it.

Keep your team connected. Last but not least, here's a management skill for our current times, to be sure. While good communication has been a valuable management attribute since, say, the Industrial Revolution... at a time when remote work is increasingly common and managers work with a mix of employees, contractors and freelancers, keeping your disparate team in close contact has become more important than ever. It's easy for remote workers to feel lonely and disconnected. Data shows maintaining connections is now a critical skill, and I 100% agree. The best managers will stay ahead of this curve and be robust, creative communicators.

Management is a multi-faceted discipline with a never-ending array of personal skills to develop. I believe these four are a positive starting point. Here's wishing you strong results in 2019.",communication
"Two years into the Donald’s would-be regency, we poor American souls face an indelicate question. For whom is this wretched man working?

Early speculation was Russia. Surely our president was a Russian agent. Why else threaten NATO, diss our allies, rip up trade agreements, undermine Mueller, fawn over Putin and quit Syria? Whether it was a pee tape or money laundering, the Russians had Trump in their pocket.

But no one who secretly loved Russia would display that love in public. That would surely backfire, eliciting even tougher sanctions. And so it did. Donald’s sycophantic embrace has hurt Russia far more than it has helped.

Perhaps our Donald is working for North Korea? Why else write love letters to the Great Leader? Why else pretend the Great Leader was destroying his nuclear weapons? Why else let the Great Leader share the stage with the Greatest Leader?

Yet a man as brilliant as His Brilliance knew that his lover’s new missiles would be quickly detected.  So Donny working for Kimmy doesn’t compute either.

Maybe the Donald is a Chinese agent? China wants to become the world’s top economic power. How best to help China than pull out of the Trans Pacific Partnership agreement, start a trade war with countries whose collective GDP is 2.5 times our own, and lay the groundwork for what will surely happen -- Chinese trade deals that include everyone but the U.S. Under this view, assigning the foaming Chinaphobe, Peter Navarro, to manage trade with China was a feint to hide Trump’s true heartthrob, Chairman Xi.

But where’s the quid pro the quo? Yes, Xi has granted trademarks to the First Daughter, but there is no Trump Tower underway in Shanghai, Beijing or Hong Kong. The Donald is clearly willing to sell out our country, but not for free.

Could Secret Agent Man be working for ISIS and/or Al-Qaeda? Cutting and running in Syria and Afghanistan support this view. But how many high rollers would venture to the Trump Raqqa to visit the ruins. Moreover, why bomb your handlers?

Perhaps Trump is a French poodle. The French and the Brits have a long and generally bad history. Supporting Brexit -- a sure recipe for Britain’s economic decline -- must delight the French.

Sorry, no. The French need the Brits to control the Germans. This is why two long-time enemies have spent the last Century making nice to one another. The Brits aren’t Brexiting because Trump is secretly working for the French. The Brits are Brexiting because the Tories have thrown a total nutty.

The Mossad? Isn’t everyone working for the Mossad? Trump moved the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem. He and Bibi are close buds. They both love walls. Plus, Trump’s daughter and son-in-law are Jews.

Nah. Trump can’t be an Israeli agent. He just knifed the Kurds – Israel’s not so secret ally -- in the back.

Trump’s secretly in bed with the Democrats? Yes, why else take one step after another to destroy the Republican Party – steps that just led to the loss of some 40 House seats?

Republicans once stood for free trade, balanced budgets, and capitalism. Trump started a trade war, is running enormous on-the-book and far larger off-the-book deficits, and feels free to tell private companies what to do. Republican members of Congress, in fear of their political lives, have looked the other way. In so doing, they have become Trump light.

Republican members of Congress used to respect our justice system and adhere to basic precepts of morality, like telling the truth. Now they are stuck supporting a man who lies with abandon, routinely denigrates the FBI and has, effectively, just been named an unindicted co-conspirator in breaking campaign finance laws. There’s more to come. There are now 17 criminal and civil investigations underway against Trump, his company or his “chartable” foundation.

Republicans, as a group, have also been tarred with Trump’s war on the free press, his racism, his isolationism, his countenance of alleged child sex offenders (remember Roy Moore?), his xenophobia, his misogyny, his disrespect for the military and our intelligence services, his government shutdown, and each and every stupidity, crudity and cruelty their master tweets at 4 AM.

Finally, Trump’s administration is well on its way to being ranked the most corrupt in U.S. history. As a result, Trump’s fatally damaged another bedrock Republican position, namely law and order.

Trump can’t be figuring out the most efficient means of killing the Republican party all on his lonesome. This is genius and Trump’s no genius. Nancy and Chuck are sending him coded txts each night at 3 AM with instructions for stabbing the Republicans in the back. Therein lies the Republicans’ saving grace. Come the next election, Republicans can claim what will, by then, be obvious to all -- “The Democrats made him do it.”",None
"A new year fills us with new hopes,

Are disasters & election hacking on their way?

Are major cyber attacks here to stay?

My dear readers, Happy New Year!  In London, England, we have now bid farewell to 2018 and welcomed the new year with renewed hope and vitality.

Whether you're in the United Kingdom, United States of America, Russia, China, Canada, India, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Africa, Australia, or anywhere in the world, I hope you're with friends or family celebrating the fresh starts in a special place.  We're all thinking of setting New Year resolutions in order to improve ourselves and usher in a prosperous 2019.  But are we taking cyber attacks into consideration? Are we becoming cyber security savvy?  If not, we certainly should be!

I believe a major cyber attack is on its way, appearing as early as 2019. It would cause unimaginable disruption and devastation.  The only limitation aside from the attacker's imagination is our preparedness.

Can we increase defence spending and capability?  Of course, we can.  But no amount of money can provide 100% security, 100% of the time.  Additionally, with various countries blaming each other for cyber attacks, how much spending and capability will be enough?  It's also worth noting that although I am not an opponent of the U.S. Trump administration, I do oppose their potential use of nuclear weapons to defend against a cyber attack!

Recently, the UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), a part of GCHQ, collaborated with law enforcement agencies to create a new incident categorisation framework. It covers a spectrum from individual hacks to national cyber emergencies.  The major cyber attack which I envision will fall within one of the two following categories in the framework:

A Category 1 attack would most likely cripple crucial elements of our Critical National Infrastructure (CNI). The key areas of CNI include transport, healthcare, energy, communications, emergency services, food, finance, water, and government.

In March 2018, a joint report from the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security claimed of a threatening Russian hacking campaign to have infiltrated the US critical infrastructure, including the US nuclear, energy, water and aviation sectors.  Reportedly, the threat actors gained access to systems across targeted US industries and harvested sensitive data, including passwords.  This access could have allowed them to shut down networks and cause blackouts.  The threat actors in this campaign used varied techniques, including:

In December 2015, Ukraine was not as fortunate as the US. Ukraine's power grid was infiltrated and taken down by a cyber attack.  The result was a massive power outage in Ukraine's capital, Kiev, which left over 220,000 people without power for hours.  The threat actors had gained access to systems linked to the 330-kilowatt sub-station ""North"".

Going back a few years to 2010, over fifteen facilities were attacked in Iran by a cyber weapon known as Stuxnet. This cyber attack targeted Supervisory Control & Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, causing substantial damage to Iran's nuclear program.  The NSA whistleblower, Edward Snowden, commented that the Stuxnet malware used to attack Iranian nuclear facilities was created by a joint operation between the Israelis and the NSA's Foreign Affairs Directorate.

While these attacks didn't lead to reported loss of life, it must make you wonder about the next one. Will 2019 bring cyber attack-related deaths? Would emergency services be able to operate if the country lost power and essential operating systems during a cyber attack?

"As the year draws to a close, many of us start to prepare mentally for a new year and a fresh start. How will you make next year better than this one?

Maybe you want to cultivate some new leadership habits and end some old ones. Or perhaps you want to take on a job challenge that stretches you. Or maybe you’re just sick and tired of the way work has been going, and you are ready for more for yourself and your career — way more.

No matter what your leadership development goals are, here’s one thing to put on your list: Consider hiring a coach.

Like an Olympic athlete, a person often can’t get to gold on their own. They need someone who knows the drills that increase strength and skill and who can push them to be better than they ever thought they could be. A coach can help you reclaim balance, prepare for a critical interview, increase leadership effectiveness, expand on your vision, reach higher. A coach will nudge you out of your comfort zone and give you straight feedback without worrying about whether or not you like it. A coach is a thought partner in really powerful ways.

A brilliant leader we know, Kelly, was the CFO for a national health care company. New to the role, she was in over her head. She had a geographically dispersed team and was working too many hours. She knew she needed help, and working with an executive coach seemed like a decent place to start. Together, she and her coach sifted through her current experience to see the patterns and shifts and wrong turns. Her coach’s job was to mirror back what he heard from a higher perspective, from the “balcony,” as Ron Heifetz calls it.

At the end of their first session, they had a plan — a clear strategy to help Kelly prioritize, delegate, develop and lead her team in more effective ways. Kelly’s team leadership went to the next level and her peers and boss noticed it.

Kelly’s story is just one of countless others, but there’s more than just anecdotal evidence supporting the value of a coach. Recent research has proven that one-to-one coaching is the most effective means of upgrading your skill set. Professional coaching encourages clients to deepen insights and translate them into action. According to Hunt and Weintraub, coaching holds the promise of transformation and is the only method of professional development that encourages a person to grow beyond surface issues. And a study by Lewis-Duarte found that coaches engage specific tactics to gain client commitment that changes behavior.

Here’s another news flash: It’s no longer a stigma to have a coach; it’s a status symbol. A staggering $1 billion was spent on business, personal and relationship coaches last year in the U.S., according to IbisWorld, up 20% from five years earlier. More and more leaders know the power of having a coach beside them. It’s a signal that your company is proactive and willing to invest in you — they see your potential and want more of it.

What might you expect if you hire a coach?

Your coach will start by gathering feedback about how others perceive you — your strengths and weaknesses. Sometimes this is done through a 360-degree assessment, other times through interviews with people who work with you. This gives your coach a good sense about where to begin. Then you will get together, face-to-face if possible, to go over the results of your feedback.

Together, you create an action plan for your development — actions you will take to change your habits, behaviors and perspective so you are more effective. And then you get to work. You’ll also meet regularly with your coach to make sure you haven’t gotten too busy with your day job and that you are moving your action plan forward and keeping your promises.

Focus and follow-through are what you will need for the kind of changes that will serve you for years to come. Challenges that seem impossible on your own can be addressed in partnership with a coach.

Are you sure you’re ready for a coach?

Having said all that, you have to be ready for a coach and candid feedback to get the value from the relationship. If you rush from meeting to meeting, if you are working long days, if you find yourself canceling and rescheduling anything that isn’t essential, you may be too busy to work with a coach. Coaching requires that you slow down to look and really see what’s going on under the surface. What’s driving unproductive behavior? What new actions and behaviors might make a difference? This takes time and energy. In addition, your coach may give you homework, such as reflection, reading and other work that requires your full attention. You have to have the time to devote to it and be willing to put in the hours.

A relatively new client of mine had been promoted to a position that scared him a little. He knew he would need new skills and tools to be successful. However, he was too busy in this new role for coaching. He worked upwards of 70 hours and then tried to spend remaining scarce hours with his family. He apologized over and over when he didn’t get his homework done. He felt bad, which was not the point of the exercise at all. It just wasn’t the right time for coaching.

As you finish out this year and begin to get ready for the next, think about your development as a leader. Think about who and how you want to be at this time next year. Will you be substantively better as a leader? If your answer to this question is yes, consider hiring a coach to help you get there.",None
"At times it can feel like life is bad on all fronts: you work is stagnant, you personal life is unsuccessful and your personal health, physical and mental, has been neglected. You are not achieving your goals or fulfilling your potential, and you are unhappy as a result. First, know this happens to everyone- you are not alone. Also know that this does not have to be your life, you can change it. You can better yourself. It will take a lot of work, a lot of courage and a lot of grit, but if you keep going and believe in yourself you are going to achieve your goals and be the best version of yourself. Here are some good habits to improve your life in the new year, that will help you reach your goals when it becomes hard to continue:

Stop Sacrificing What You Want Most For What You Want Right Now

It would be lovely to relax, watch a movie or a show, meet a friend for dinner, etc. instead of working longer on a project that needs attention, going to the gym, making dinner at home, etc. Instant gratification is seductive and satisfying, but not when it is at the expense of long term goals, especially goals that will help build your self-esteem and help make progress towards your goals. Stop sacrificing substantive happiness, that will bring you consistent and lasting joy for superficial, momentary happiness, which will fade quickly and ultimately extend unhappiness.

If you are looking for a reason/excuse not to do the right thing, you will surely find one. Part of taking ownership of your life and reflecting on how you got to an unhappy state is understanding how you are enabling your poor decisions. It is usually with excuses, like you're tired, or you don't have time when you're not making time, you will do it tomorrow, etc. Stop making excuses, and start owning your life and pushing yourself to do the work. Happiness doesn't fall into your lap, it takes work like everything else. So get out of your own way and stop making excuses.

When someone makes a comment, gives unsolicited advice, or treats you poorly, unless you did something to merit a reaction, chances are the comment says more about the commenter than it does about you. Do not let people discourage you, or tell you who you are when they are not close to you. Keep moving forward, build on your progress and do not let people get you down. Not only because you should stay focused and because what they said likely isn't true and doesn't matter, but because most of all it wasn't really about you in the first place.

If you need to feel better at this moment, go change your clothes and go get some exercise. Endorphins make you happy; they release stress and help clear your mind. If you want some perspective, go work out first then revisit the issue. Chances are your emotions will be stabilized, your mind will be sharper and you will have less anxiety than you did before you got some exercise. So if you panic and feel overwhelmed by whatever you have been confronted with, try and see if you can get some exercise before you make a decision. You will make a decision that is less reactive and more grounded in reason than emotion.

If you find yourself wasting a lot of time staring at various screens, constantly checking social media or mindlessly doing things on your phone, start trying to monitor those habits and change them. Whatever your go-to distraction is, start managing it so you can be more productive and stop wasting time.

You are not a victim of every whim and circumstance, you do have some control over your life at any given time. It is about how you wield that control that determines whether you change your circumstances. Stop resisting responsibility for your life, because the sooner you take ownership of it and stop blaming others, you will have more autonomy, you will start doing the work therefore you will begin making progress.

Any wildly successful person has failed, sometimes on a massive, humbling scale. No one who is successful will ever judge you for failing, so start summoning your courage and stop being afraid to work hard and fail. The only people who will ever judge you are people who have not failed themselves, usually because they've made incredibly safe choices. So face your fears, stop being afraid of failure and do the work. Doing the work is how you gather courage and begin making progress towards becoming your best self.",None
"What does introspection have to do with building a thriving business? Everything! .   Leadership is inside-out work, so the more you build the internal muscle for reflection and meta-cognitive skills, the better off will be those around you. Approach this new year of 2019 by applying the 3 R's: Review, Reclaim and Renew.   Here are three short inspirational perspectives to guide you.

While browsing John Maeda's blog, Design.co, I found a reference to a speech by John W. Gardner- a social activist, scholar & former Secretary of Health, Education & Welfare under President Lyndon B. Johnson. The speech was delivered to a group of McKinsey associates in 1990.  Elements of the speech were related to Gardner's book Self Renewal.   In addressing those chief counselors to corporate America, Gardner stressed the importance of self-reflection in the process of advising organizations.  A passage most relevant to the need to review:

""Life is an endless unfolding, and if we wish it to be, an endless process of self-discovery, an endless and unpredictable dialogue between our own potentialities and the life situations in which we find ourselves.""

The phrase ""endless unfolding"" underlies the value in review, in order to understand the interconnection of life's experiences.

The writings of the Stoics are handy here when thinking about what you may need to reclaim as a leader.  Stoics value being steadfast in the face of uncertainty, and their writings are especially helpful in riding the waves of failure. Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius (AD 121-180) wrote:

""Revere your capacity for making decisions. Everything depends on this alone, so that your guiding part does not make a decision that is contrary to ... your makeup as a being endowed with reason. This demands freedom from rash judgments [and] fellowship with others...""

Reclaiming is about action, something that the Stoics were all about.  Interestingly, the Latin etymology of the word decide is about ""cutting off"";  i.e. cutting off certain choices in order to make room for other options and define purpose.

Creativity is an act of renewal- and the primary engine for innovation. Use the New Year as an opportunity to commit to creative practice on a regular basis.  And remember this admonition from the modern dancer Twyla Tharp:

""The thing about creativity is, people are going to laugh at it. Get over it.""",None
"Despite the ubiquitous success of the current model, there remain several issues that an upcoming generation of platforms plan to overcome by focusing on decentralizing the cloud infrastructure with artificial intelligence (AI) and yes, blockchains.

The new cloud computing infrastructure can support scalable applications for businesses with enhanced efficiency in both cost and computation while retaining the safeguards of a decentralized, trust-minimized ecosystem. Here's how.

The vulnerability of data in centralized 'walled gardens' security models continually proves its ineffectiveness on a massive scale. Marriott's recent hack was one of the largest ever and follows a string of high-profile examples throughout 2018. When proponents of decentralization tout security as one of its vital advantages, we need to listen because clearly, the current status quo is unacceptable.

However, Gartner recently highlighted that competition is dwindling in the public cloud computing sector as major players aggregate more power. Decentralizing cloud infrastructure with blockchains may sound promising at face value, but scalability issues plaguing blockchains require a hybrid approach.

Blockchains and AI have a symbiotic relationship, and their potential convergence is undergoing vigorous research and development. Platforms that take a multi-faceted approach to next-generation cloud infrastructure are poised to succeed.

Blockchains inherently provide a degree of decentralization. However, the emphasis on openness and immutability of several major public cryptocurrency networks makes them less than ideal choices for businesses looking to build scalable applications with permissioned governance.

AI, on the other hand, can help to alleviate some of the issues preventing companies from using blockchains in a variety of ways. AI presents a more efficient mechanism for resources on blockchain and cloud networks to be allocated.

AI can also automatically adjust to network activity and appropriate the resources necessary for an application to scale or minimize costs for transactions and data storage. Further, AI tools can be used to reduce network latency and improve the energy efficiency of blockchains.

Platforms like DeepCloud AI--a blockchain-based AI cloud computing platform--are explicitly focusing on creating the robust cloud backbone through a unique integration of AI, and blockchain. DeepCloud AI uses a P2P matching algorithm for allocating computational and storage resources on the network. They address security with Intel's SGX secure-enclave computing, encapsulating resource allocation and computation on the network between permissioned parties. Supply chain Internet of Things (IoT) devices that are vulnerable to hacking can operate within a secure environment outside of third-party influence.

Other decentralized cloud computing platforms--like DFINITY and Golem--also emphasize levelling the playing field between cloud service participants. DFINITY comes with its own 'Blockchain Nervous System' for monitoring and adjusting to network requirements, while Golem focuses on allowing users to share additional computational resources in a global computing network.

The myriad partnerships in the space already demonstrate that decentralized cloud computing platforms are viewed very favorably by businesses. Perhaps with decentralized cloud computing, the original conception of the Internet--that has yet to be fully realized--can finally be achieved.",None
"We've been getting feedback about how much sleep is optimal for a while now. A recent, massive study of 44,000 people, for example, concluded most of us need about 7 to 8 hours of shuteye every night. If you're not having dreams when you hit the hay, though, that could spell trouble, even if you're supposedly meeting the rest guidelines.

Sleep experts break down a sleep cycle, which normally lasts about 90 minutes, into five distinct phases or stages. As you go through these stages, your brain waves generally slow down, and the body engages in physiological changes for rest, such as reduced heart rate and body temperature.

The last of the five sleep stages, which generally lasts about 25 minutes, is Rapid Eye Movement (REM). While you can dream in any stage, this is when you have your most intense dream and brain activity. In fact, according to Dr. George Zureikat, medical director of the Mid-Michigan Sleep Center in Grand Blanc, as much as 80 percent of dreams happen during this phase.

The exact biological reason for sleep is still somewhat of a mystery. But the research we have so far suggests that REM is important for memory consolidation and working out how to handle problems, although more research is needed to be conclusive. A lack of REM sleep is associated with slower cognitive and social processing, as well as trouble concentrating and making decisions.

Because the presence of dreams is an easy way to gauge whether you're getting into REM, if you're rarely dreaming anything you can remember, it could be a warning sign that you're not getting past the initial sleep stages, and that your amount of REM sleep isn't adequate.

So let's say you aren't really getting through the sleep stages the way you should. What could be causing you to stay out of dreamland? Common issues that interfere with sleep are

While some of these issues are easy to manage on your own, others, like health conditions, might require you to get a helping hand. That's OK, and when in doubt, don't hesitate to get yourself checked out. The important thing is just that you recognize that your sleep isn't as good as it could be, and that you advocate for yourself to get it back on track.",None
"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez may have much to learn about politics. When it comes to knowing herself, this 29-year old woman just elected to Congress is well beyond her years. “I am starting a week of self-care,” she Tweeted in December, “where I am taking the week off and taking care of me.”

Ocasio-Cortez has been working nearly non-stop during her campaign as well as campaigning for other candidates across the country. She has gone through “freshmen orientation” on Capitol Hill. Taking time off is nothing new for politicians. However, in years past, many had vacation homes to which to retire. For a time, Ocasio-Cortez had yet to find lodgings in Washington D.C.

Critics pounced on Ocasio-Cortez. In one particularly nasty tweet she was called unemployed and so asked, why so tired? Helaine Olen, in her op-ed for the Washington Post about the situation, writes, “American culture is forever suspicious of what’s perceived as frivolity, particularly when it’s practiced by people who are traditional caretakers or who are without monetary means.” In other words, if you are poor, you had better get to work.

A recent Wall Street Journal article noted that successful people many high-profile individuals begin their days at 4 a.m. For example, Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO, gets up at 3.45 a.m. every day to answer email and make phone calls across various time zones. Bully for Tim, I say. He’s well compensated. Nonsense. In a recent tweet, Adam Grant, Wharton professor, and best-selling author, wrote, “The world’s most successful people aren’t worried about what time others wake up. They wake and work on the schedule that works for them.”

Few in America brag about time off; it’s almost regarded as something sinful. Our culture is hardly religious, yet we seem most Puritanical about work. Nothing wrong with hard work, but too often work is considered “hard” if the hours are long. Many employees fall into the trap of grinding out longer hours because their boss does the same. There is the perception that if they work “normal hours” they are slackers. In such instances, activity is equated to productivity. Work hard but work smart!

And let me add work wisely. That is, like Ocasio-Cortez, make time for self. Exercise, eat right and indulge yourself in your passions. You need downtime to re-energize. For many work is energizing but too much work for too long becomes an addiction.

If you want to rise early, do so. But if like me, you need more sleep, stay in bed. Getting up without sufficient sleep can be detrimental to your health. The average adult should have between 7-8 hours a night. Some can get by on far less without seeming to lose steam, but they may be the exception.

What matters is how you feel physically as well as mentally. Feeling compelled to log the hours for the sake of hours erodes an individual’s self-esteem. You sense that you must keep up, but when you cannot do it physically, you get down on yourself.

Let the CEO and celebrities who bank millions annually brag about their 4 a.m. routines. Me, I am racking my eight hours and feeling good about myself and my work.",None
"“They’ll think I’m a freak, a weirdo, a lunatic or some ridiculous buffoon!” These are some of the thoughts that run through my head when someone asks about what I do. And in some respects, it’s true. I’m somewhat unconventional, a bit quirky and not just a little shady. Consequently, it’s not uncommon to get some quizzical looks when I talk about NightCare, our program to look after the babies and toddlers of third-world sex workers while their moms work. It’s a new concept and massively essential, albeit unique.

Recently, I had an unexpected conversation with a fellow traveler on an airplane, and it went surprisingly well. We exchanged the customary pleasantries, and then he began asking me about my work. I knew where the conversation was going, and I decided to be confident and explain what we do without apologizing for or minimizing our work.

I was pleasantly surprised that the gentleman was not only interested but even concerned as I explained the need for NightCare. From this exchange, I concluded that it’s certainly possible that his positive reaction was, in part, a result of my decision to forgo my insecurities and confidently step into the conversation.

This small experience served as a big reminder that I want to share with you: Don’t let self-doubt control your decisions, conversations or actions. Being less than completely confident is a universal human experience, despite our best efforts. Recognizing and acknowledging such insecurities is an important starting place from which to mature and improve.

Dismissing, ignoring or justifying insecurities can be not only hazardous but downright destructive if they’re allowed to remain major influences in our lives. Insecurity can sabotage our efforts to achieve our utmost potential. Indeed, I would suggest that possibly the singular most limiting factor in being effective, both personally and professionally, is insecurity.

This factor is expressed in a variety of ways. For some, it is expressed through acting overly confident, demonstrative, vocal, dismissive and maybe even strident. For others, it is communicated by nervous twitches, mumbled sentences or minimizing verbiage that diminishes what is both real and truthful. The worst expression of insecurity is when we don’t show up, whether it's in conversations, at important events or in heated exchanges.

As I reflect on the conversation I had with this fellow traveler, there are a few things that were particularly helpful to me and could be useful to you as a nonprofit leader.

1. Accept your core self and not just who you think you should be. Often, we try to compensate for our inadequacies by pretending to be someone we are not. This strategy only lends insult to injury. Be you -- full stop.

2. Your physical actions can have direct effects on your attitude and mental conversations. I’ve found it helpful to take the low road and do the humble thing. I’m learning that arrogance repels and humility attracts.

3. When making decisions as leaders, we are not afforded the luxury to be selfish or self-absorbed. Our personal insecurity can be a massively debilitating intrusion to making effective decisions. We must put our doubts aside to make the best quality decisions.

4. Celebrate your individuality. There’s nobody on the planet like you, and that’s fantastic. You have unique ways of looking at things, and that’s not bad. Rather than conforming to the status quo, chasing after social media followers or seeking to emulate a trendy popular figure, be you! Echoes are recycled sound, and no human is designed to be a repeat.

5. Assess the areas in your thoughts or emotions that are most vulnerable to insecurity. What situations accentuate your insecurities? When are you the most relaxed and confident?

As you think about these questions and application points, consider what factors are the biggest influences for being insecure, as well as being confident. This kind of reflection can help you with self-discovery on the journey to overcoming insecurity. I suspect that when we are nakedly vulnerable, we are all insecure, and as leaders, we cannot afford to let our insecurities dominate our conversations, actions or attitudes.",None
"The annual Global Peter Drucker Forum has become the management conference of the year. It is dubbed the “Davos” of Management Conferences and features the “Who’s Who” of management thinkers. It is a result of Richard Straub’s conviction and tireless efforts to continue the legacy of Peter Drucker (1909-2005). Drucker led the management forefront at the cutting edge back then, and has become even more relevant now.

I had the great honor of speaking at the Forum this past November. Here are the three big management trends I observed at the 10th annual GPDF, which I hope will inform and benefit leaders and management scholars around the globe.

Successful leadership is defined by how well s/he delivers on the basis of competition of the day, which in turn depends on the business environment. In the post-Industrial era, the environment was stable. What made companies successful—the basis of competition—was how efficiently they produced physical goods. They knew what output they had to produce, and those who produced the output most cheaply won, because not much changed between the input and the output. It gave rise to management tools such as bureaucracy, time and motion studies, the Balanced Score Card, Linear Programming, Six Sigma, and Enterprise Resource Planning. All of these tools were designed to improve efficiency, solving for known variables in a stable business environment. In the process, each business had to optimize all inputs, including raw materials, equipment, and even people. But today’s environment has become a lot more VUCA (volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous) and the basis of competition has changed from efficiency to learning and innovation (for more on this, see my previous post here). Any organism who doesn’t change as fast as its environment faces extinction.

To deliver on the Industrial-era mantra of efficiency and standardization, we dehumanized people. Corporate Legal departments have systematically attempted to eliminate all elements of emotions and touch in the workplace, because they are messy, unpredictable legal liabilities. As result, the workplace has become sterile: void of human connection. However, the best way to deliver on the new basis of competition—learning  and innovation—is through trial and error, diversity of thought, and self-organization, all of which require unleashing our human potential as unique, idiosyncratic thinkers with diverse perspectives.

Today’s workplace requires us to respect workers as individuals, and trust them to respond to unforeseen environmental perturbations. Rather than be supervised and micromanaged by those who are disconnected from the realities of the real-time situation, we need them to respond to unpredictable changes in the rapidly changing environment. We can no longer succeed by squeezing the last drop of productivity from people to efficiently produce error-free predetermined output. Things on the ground are changing too quickly; what we measure and control today may be completely irrelevant tomorrow.

Winning in the new environment compels us to reclaim human connection in the workplace. We need to allow workers to think for themselves so they create a self-healing, adaptive organization, complete with idiosyncrasies and imperfect trials. We must allow ourselves and our employees to be the amazing learning machines we are meant to be. All the recent trends in employee engagement, employee experience management, and humanistic workplace (read: no more jerk bosses) are the result of this realization.

For the principles of self-organization to work, individuals must act in the best interest of the organization, even if it conflicts with their self-interest. For these principles to work in everyone’s best interest, we must practice trust, reciprocity, and ethical behavior for the greater good of the entire organization, and indeed the entire planet. It is no longer prudent to maximize short-term earnings by sacrificing employee morale, exploiting the environment, or crushing the competition with a zero-sum game mentality, because today’s leaders in VUCA must accept this inconvenient truth: attempts to control employees and situations at lower levels stifle innovation and often create unexpected negative results at higher levels (see my post here for more on this) disproportionate to the magnitude of the input. High moral and ethical standards in individual leaders and organizations, as well as nations, are needed now more than ever. Due to the long germination required for radical innovation, learning-driven innovation requires a long-term approach to earnings. Hence, a realignment of incentives between the board of directors, investors, and the firm’s management is likely required.

These takeaways from the 10th GPDF are relevant for leadership practitioners and scholars alike. Embrace these principles and produce radical innovation to lead tomorrow — or disappear into the sunset as dinosaurs of the bygone era.",None
"Leaders in the workplace have to wear several hats and perform a lot of procedural and cultural functions. Maybe one of the most critical, as well as the most difficult to master, is conflict resolution. You won't like hearing this, but every leader's approach to this will, and must, be different.

There are no two identical matches between team and leader anyplace in the world. That means your mileage might vary when it comes to following these conflict tips for leaders. However, we bet there's something here that might help you think differently, or maybe just a little more empathetically, next time it falls to you to diffuse workplace tension or manage a conflict. Here are some things to keep in mind.

There can be a strong temptation, among people in positions of power, to strive for the appearance of harmony at the expense of all else. Maybe it's a middle-manager who wants the CEO to see all's well. Maybe you just don't like confrontation.

However, part of being a leader is working potential confrontations to your advantage. There's no value in stifling differences of opinion or brushing problems under the table — or even ignoring them altogether. Refusing to meet workplace conflicts head-on, and patiently — or being ambivalent or playing favorites by not taking one of the parties seriously — is a quick way to sour the tone and trustworthiness of your workplace. If people don't feel they can be candid with you about their conflicts and disagreements, and expect a patient ear in return, they'll stop trying.

For quite a few reasons, timing can be everything when it comes to resolving conflicts in the workplace. Maybe you've heard two co-workers arguing about something trivial. Maybe they're even butting heads over the current trajectory of a project they're both working on. Knowing the right time to step in, if any, is critical here.

At the risk of not sounding very helpful, this is something every leader will have to ""read the room"" for. You know your people. If you let them sit in the trenches a little longer, will they work it out and become stronger for it? Is an earlier intervention better? Don't base the timing of your intervention on the content of the conflict, but rather the tone. Leaders need to be able to detect even the nuances of the emotions involved in workplace conflicts, because what's not being said is often just as important as what is. Moreover, it's vital to remain in control of your own emotions. Timing, tone of voice and a patient disposition are your friends.

There's another wrinkle for leaders when it comes to intervening in potential conflicts, and it's about culture clashes as well as more overt wrongdoing.

As a leader, there might be times when some employees seem to march to a different drum or do things differently than you'd like, to the point where you're thinking about intervening. Maybe they have a nuanced workflow or they require a modified schedule. In this case, stepping in means creating conflict where none might necessarily exist. Have these conflicts of culture resulted in poor productivity or compromised work quality? If not, this is a time for compromise rather than conflict management.

In grimmer cases of leadership intervention, the right time to step in means waiting for unassailable proof of wrongdoing or a seriously poor match, culture-wise. Be responsible with your due diligence, since leveling a false accusation is bad for your reputation as a leader and unpleasant for everybody involved.

Workplace conflict isn't something that happens around or beneath workplace leaders — they're sometimes in the thick of it, and possibly the target of the conflict in the first place. The first rule is not to panic.

For any type of leader, resolving conflicts can be difficult when they involve you in some way — and there's no easy to way recuse yourself. The best thing you can do — and this is something your employees and team members will likely remember and take away with them — is to check your insecurities at the door. If you're a leader, it means you have blind spots. If somebody brings a concern to you, one hopes they do so in a patient, private manner. Even if they don't, it's your responsibility to listen to them openly and either diffuse their concerns or make some changes.

There's no room in the modern workplace, or anywhere else, for stubborn pride. If everybody was a little more confidently vulnerable, there'd be no stopping us.

At the end of the day, being a leader is, maybe more than anything else, about helping people reach their full potential — in this role or in whatever the next challenge is that awaits them. We all like to say that making mistakes is part of what helps us grow, which means conflict resolution is a chance to help people see another side to their thinking. Even the phrase ""conflict resolution"" itself sounds like a confrontation, but with the right frame of mind, and maybe an open heart, it doesn't have to be one.",None
"Trading on Apple shares was halted as the company warned of much lower sales than the guidance it had issued just two months ago. A punishing holiday season turned into lower than expected iPhone sales, which are the economic engine of the company. After-hours trading immediately sent shares down by more than 7 percent.

The guidance issued at the company's last earnings announcement was for revenue between $89 billion and $93 billion, expenses of $9 billion to $9.1 billion, and gross margins between 38 percent and 38.5 percent.

The new guidance pegs revenue expectations at $84 billion, sharply below the low end of the previous estimates. Gross margin will be roughly 38 percent, at the low end of the previous range. Total expenses will be about $9.25 billion, or above prior estimates.

According to a letter from Tim Cook to investors, there are multiple reasons for the cut. He said that the company knew the timing of its iPhone launches could be a problem, shifting back as they did by a fiscal quarter. The number of launches was complex and caused logistics problems getting everything built and shipped. In addition, a strong dollar made overseas sales costlier for buyers.

But those were constraints on the top end of sales. The big issues were ""expected economic weakness in some emerging markets."" Specifically, the big slowdown was in Greater China. ""In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad,"" the letter said.

At the heart was a slowing economy in China, in part likely because of the trade war with the U.S., but also a result of purely internal problems in the country. Whatever the balance, the result was ""fewer iPhone upgrades than we had anticipated.""

Cook went on and tried to put some shine on the situation, pointing to almost 19 percent year-over-year growth in the combination of services, Macs, iPads, and wearables and other products. But while good for the future, that doesn't matter.

Apple faces what happens to many businesses, particularly smaller ones. They become prisoners of one product line or a particularly big customer. When that happens, all you can do is try to diversify, because the day will come when the source of money trips and what was a profitable dependence begins to hit financial results.

Apple has tried to do that, but none of the new growth comes close to the magnitude of the iPhone contribution. And China was supposed to be the new engine of growth when none of the other product lines--iPads or Watches--showed itself possessing the potential once shown by the company's smartphones.",None

"A common theme of people who email me for help with their career is that their jobs are terrible, their bosses are unreasonable, and their pay is too low.. The problem is, you can only change your own actions. While people will react differently if you behave differently, you have to make the changes to begin with.

For a new year, I think it's useful to remember Albert Ellis' words: ""The best years of your life are the ones in which you decide your problems are your own. You do not blame them on your mother, the ecology, or the president. You realize that you control your own destiny."" -- Kirsty Miller (@juscallmekirsty) January 1, 2019

""The best years of your life are the ones in which you decide your problems are your own. You do not blame them on your mother, the ecology, or the president. You realize that you control your own destiny.""

Yes, you can blame your boss for your misery, but it will only make your life miserable. You have options. (And yes, you always have options.) For instance, you can

Each of these options requires actions by you. Yes, your boss is a jerk. I totally accept that, but only your actions can change.

Quitting your job without another lined up and moving in with your mother idea is probably a bad idea and I don't recommend it (as a general rule), but if you choose to stay at the job to avoid that consequence, own it. You are in control. You really are.

This can apply in all areas of your life. Your spouse is awful? You can decide to stay or go, get counseling, or complain to your friends, but it's your choice. Your car breaks down? You can decide how to change your life to get a better car, get your current car fixed, or you can embrace public transportation.

Once we recognize that we have control over our own lives, we can make decisions and take responsibility for them.

This doesn't mean bad things don't happen. Of course, they do! You can't control that a drunk driver ran a red light and hit your car, but you can control how you respond to it. You can't control a company layoff, but you can control how you respond.

This is my motto for 2019. It's my life and my carer and my problems, so I will take control and make my own decisions. Please join me!",None
"Feeling good about yourself allegedly goes hand in hand with getting ahead--the more confidence you have, the idea goes, the more you'll take healthy risks, reach out to others and persevere even when the going's tough. Don't be worried if your self-esteem is a little cracked at the moment, though, because psychologists say it's going to improve.

As outlined by Abigail Fagan in Psychology Today, researchers from the University of Bern did an extensive review of studies related to self-esteem. After combing through the 331 studies, which involved more than 164,000 people between 4 and 94 years old, they were able to formulate a basic line chart that demonstrates the typical pattern of self-esteem growth over the lifespan.

As you might expect, the teen years are a little turbulent, with self-esteem leveling off for a bit as people figure out how to navigate socially. But after that, self-esteem shoots up through the late 20s. It continues to rise, although a little more slowly, through the mid 40s. Growth starts to level out, but it doesn't actually peak until around age 60.

That's right. You'll probably feel  your very best well after you've established your career and have started to notice gray hairs in the mirror.

While the researchers acknowledge that there's some individual variance, they point out that the typical self-esteem trajectory is much more positive than psychologists and scientists had thought before.

But why is the time around age 60 so great? The research isn't clear. But it might be that, through their careers, people build successes and become increasingly able to look back on their skills and accomplishments. They also usually know more people who can offer support and honest feedback, and they've often built themselves up in areas like finance so that they feel stable. At the same time, they're close enough to retirement that they can positively anticipate a new, relaxing phase of life, and they're often still physically capable of participating in activities that bring them happiness. The later decline of self-esteem, particularly the sharp drop off in the late 80s, might be because isolation and ailment increases while the ability to remember, share skills or information and contribute goes down.

For you as a professional, take these results and recognize that there are going to be a lot of people around you who are just as weighted down with confusion and doubt as you might be. Don't make the mistake of thinking that everyone has it totally together or has a crystal clear concept of what they're supposed to do or where they're meant to be. Share what you've learned and encourage those below you, and at the same time, never be ashamed to seek guidance yourself from more seasoned individuals who have been around the block. Don't be discouraged, because the best is yet to come.",None

Said to me, after several glasses of very friendly Grenache, by someone even richer than all the desserts you've had in the last 10 days. He stayed in his astoundingly high-powered job for two more years, because he couldn't quite let go. He has even more money now. He also has so many regrets about the two years he missed, because he knows what he would have done with them. You see, once he retired serious illness soon struck.

2. Admit To Yourself When You've Chosen The Wrong Career.

Here was someone who'd succeeded in her career. She spent more than 20 years grinding her way to the (alleged) top. ""I could never allow myself to accept that I really didn't like what I was doing,"" she told me. ""It was like being in a bad relationship, where you tell yourself you've invested so much that you have to make it work."" Oh, she made it work. Most people think she was a success, but she wishes she had the chance to do it all over again. And do something else.

A successful tech type in his early 30's told me: ""I know we're supposed to be always-on, but if you do that, you'll always be subject to someone else's system."" His solution is to not work on Sundays. Not for religious reasons, but just to rest his mind. If, for some reason, there's an essential work happening on a Sunday, someone else has to deal with it. ""Hey, it works for Chick-fil-A,"" he says.

4. No Single Day Is The End Of The World.

This was told to me by someone who'd made money in two different businesses and endured four failures, a couple quite spectacular. ""If one day can really define you, it means the thousands of others are meaningless,"" he told me. ""Now that can't be right, can it?""

5. It's a Lot More Fun Pleasing Customers Than Just Making Money.

This was told to me by someone who started on Wall Street and made money from money -- and then helped build a company that provided a simple product, but one that was truly appreciated by a very niche audience. He admitted he made more money on Wall Street. He admitted, too, that emails from happy customers moved him in a way that money never could.",None

"Malcolm Gladwell has built a career out of sifting through dry research, unearthing overlooked ideas and presenting them in appealing or novel ways for readers or customers.

He is best-known for writing regarded nonfiction books like Blink, Outliers and The Tipping Point, and Gladwell’s approach to his craft can help you succeed in business.

Gladwell spends hundreds of hours talking with and emailing other writers about ideas he wants to use in his books.

While speaking, for example, Gladwell gauges his audience's reaction to figure out what was interesting or boring. He also uses arguments from his audience to hone the quality of his works.

This practice of publicly testing ideas helps Gladwell learn how to articulate himself clearly and concisely. It also helps him decide what to expand on or cut from his books.

He said, “The act of explaining an idea to somebody else is a really good way to figure out how to tell the story.”

You can test business ideas by emailing peers and asking for feedback and by showing early versions of your work to customers rather than waiting until you've finished your product or service.

Iterative feedback will help you strengthen the best parts of your products or services and cut what’s not working.

Gladwell was surprised by which ideas caught on from his book Outliers, notably the claim that mastery of a skill requires 10,000 hours—or ten years—of deliberate practice.

Later, he found himself in a curious position whereby the book's ideas and arguments were often misconstrued by others.

Gladwell said, ""Once you've written something, it no longer belongs to you. It belongs to your readers. When your readers buy your book, they really buy your ideas, and your ideas become theirs.""

When someone buys your product or service, you might wonder why customers like one aspect of your product or service and dislike another. You can get in front of this issue by recruiting beta, or first, customers.

A beta customer provides feedback privately about your product or service before it's released. A reviewer, however, writes their thoughts on Amazon, Trustpilot or elsewhere after you release a product.

You can address the first type of feedback immediately and the second type over the long-term. It's up to you to decide which responses to address and which to pass on.

Your work doesn’t end after you release a product or service or ship a big project.

In Gladwell's debut nonfiction book, The Tipping Point, he explains how little things led to remarkable results. However, The Tipping Point wasn't a huge success upon publication.

Gladwell said, ""The book didn't do well at first…I got it in my head that if I kept touring and I kept giving talks about it, it might revive. I basically did endless promotions for two years.""

The Tipping Point eventually entered the New York Times best seller list as a paperback, and according to Gladwell, ""that's when it was a successful book.""

Promote your work in the right places, with your boss, colleagues, customers or peers. Like Gladwell, spend time meeting would-be customers. Avoid averting your gaze just because a deadline has elapsed.

Gladwell is a successful business writer in part because he understands what his audience struggles with and wants.

He takes ideas from different industries and tells stories about them in a unique way that appeals to his audience.

Even if you've no ambition to become a business writer, use elements of Gladwell's approach to test your products and ideas and help them succeed.",None
"It’s no secret that women tend to downplay their success. A tangible example of this comes from LinkedIn, where women list 11% fewer skills than men, even when they have similar work experience.

That’s not to say men are right and women are wrong. Studies show men often land on the exaggerated/bragging end of the spectrum when it comes to touting their skills.

But, an unwillingness to talk honestly about achievements can hurt women. LinkedIn members with five or more skills listed receive up to 17 times more profile views.

Some women fear looking arrogant or  worry that their achievements will make those around them feel bad. They say, “Oh, it was nothing,” when they’re praised in a meeting or they don’t share their accomplishments in a job interview.

For others, the problem is internal—they don’t feel worthy of their achievement. They cringe when they’re given compliments because they aren’t comfortable hearing nice things about themselves. Or, they fear they aren’t worthy of their success.

Owning your success, both internally and externally, will help you feel worthy of your achievement and give other people an opportunity to celebrate alongside you.

Mentally strong women know their worth and they refuse to shrink themselves for other people . Here's how they talk about their achievements without sounding arrogant and how they own remind themselves that they're worthy of their success:

Deflecting comments, by saying things like, “I just got lucky,” or “No, you’re amazing!” means you aren’t giving yourself credit. Even though compliments may feel uncomfortable to hear, try responding with a simple, “Thank you.”

It’s OK to celebrate your success and allow others to recognize your achievement. Of course, this only applies to sincere compliments (as opposed to backhanded ones or unwanted comments about your appearance).

If you start a sentence by saying something like, “I don’t want to sound like I’m bragging, but…” you’ll sound as if you’re about to say something hurtful and you don’t care. Whether you’re telling your friends you got a raise or you want your family to hear about the latest deal you closed, spread your enthusiasm by saying something like, “I’m excited to share…” and you’ll set the tone for how it’s received.

When you’re uncomfortable sharing your success, you might be tempted to mix a self-deprecating statement with a little self-praise. But making a social media post that says, “Ugh, I’m watching my interview on CNN and it’s so hard to hear the sound of my voice,” will make you sound insincere. Just skip to the good part and trust that people will be able to handle your success.

Owning your success doesn’t mean taking credit for everything. Express gratitude for the people, experiences, and good fortune you’ve encountered along the way. Saying something like, “I’m so grateful that my parents taught me the value of hard work,” can help you acknowledge the team who has helped you along the way—just make sure the credit you give is deserved.

5. They stick to the facts.

You’ll be sure to get some eye rolls if you say, “I’m the best thing that’s ever happened to my company.” Clearly, that’s your opinion. Stick to the facts by saying something like, “My team doubled their sales this year,” and you won’t sound arrogant.

Acting as if college were a joke or that rising through the ranks were simple might make you sound a bit narcissistic. Focus on the effort it took to get there and you’ll earn respect. Say something like, “I’m so pleased to see that all the hard work I put in is starting to pay off.”

7. They remind themselves of their achievements.

Dwelling on your failures and beating yourself up over your mistakes will cause you to feel as though you aren’t good enough. Create a list of 10 things you’re proud of or keep an ongoing journal of your everyday accomplishments. Those reminders will help you feel worthy of your success.

Owning your success is about thinking, feeling, and acting as though you are comfortable in your own skin. So even if it feels uncomfortable at first, keep working at it.

Acknowledging your success to others as well as to yourself can help you begin to see yourself as worthy of your achievement. It can help you build more mental strength. As you grow stronger, the more comfortable you'll feel owning your success.",None
"As a time management coach, I'm very conscious of how I spend my time. I try to accomplish activities in the most effective, efficient way possible, and I'm typically pretty good at filtering out the noise that can interrupt or distract me.

But I was shocked to discover that I had an Achilles' heel. A small flaw in my thinking was leading to up to 10 hours a week of unnecessary effort.

Here was my issue: Whenever I told myself, ""This is going to be so hard and require so much effort,"" I then made the activity hard and require a lot of effort. The flaw in my thinking was creating a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Fortunately, I was able to address this issue with these three simple steps that anyone can follow to help shift their mindset and save time on tasks they perceive as difficult.

1. Tell yourself that an activity can be easy.

When you stop telling yourself that an activity will be awful, take a ton of effort and lead to little results and instead start telling yourself that an activity can be effortless and easy, you can often stop dreading it and procrastinating on it. You can stop finding ways to make a mountain out of a molehill. From that place of peace, you can think a lot more logically and clearly about what you actually need to do and also relax about the whole process.

I know that this mindset shift sounds strange or even impossible to do when your past experience tells you that an activity will be hard. But it can really work.

When we think activities will be really hard, we can sabotage our success and waste a lot of time by not putting limits on our actions. For example, if you tell yourself it's going to be so hard to get new clients, you might think of 20 different things to do and then overwhelm yourself trying to do all of them. Or when it comes to your health, if you tell yourself it will be so hard to get into shape and then you try to change everything all at once in an extreme way, you may feel overwhelmed and end up eating chocolate chip cookie dough at midnight in despair.

But when you tell yourself that an activity can be easy and strictly limit your actions, you can stop dreading the activity, stop spending excessive time on it, stop taking actions that don’t lead to results and stop procrastinating. For example, as the end of 2018 was approaching, I asked myself, ""What's the one most important activity for the end of this year?"" Then I asked myself, ""What are the next most important activities?"" I narrowed my goals down to three so I could filter out all the other noise.

By doing this, I was able to be successful in investing consistent time in reaching them. My top three goals have all been achieved. This focus really helped me carve out time to make the most important activities a priority. A big part of this success also came from using my top goals to decide what not to do — not investing in other business development activities, training, etc., that would keep me from the activities I considered most important.

In certain areas of my life, I was making activities that I perceived as difficult even harder on myself by not limiting the time frame for completing them. My thinking was, ""This might be helpful to me in achieving my goal, so I might as well get it done, no matter how long it takes,"" instead of thinking, ""I only have an hour — what really matters? I'm going to do that first and let everything else just fall by the wayside.""

I found that setting a time constraint really helps me focus and reduces my stress about the activity and, surprisingly, it seems to lead to results that are just as good. Being busier doesn't always equal being more productive.

Let's stop making activities hard and start making them easier and less time-consuming with these three simple steps.",None
"The world changes, circumstances and opportunities change, “the only constant is change itself.” Charles Darwin claimed, “It is not the strongest or the most intelligent who will survive but those who can best manage change.” It may not be possible to predict the future, yet, in an increasingly fast-paced digital world future gazing is becoming an increasingly important necessity in business.

With the rise in A.I., it is possible that the workplace will evolve to focus more on tasks that only people can do, moving away from repetitive tasks to ones that require creative thinking and interaction with other people. When science fiction writer Issac Asimov was asked to predict the future in 1983, he stated that robotics would revolutionize the way we work, with automation stealing administrative and factory jobs. The “workplace” will one day be a distant memory as people will spend more time in a variety of environments, more innovative companies think about a workspace as being a network of spaces. The internet is a great enabler of flexibility and mobility. Technology advancements have the potential to drive productivity by nurturing innovation, creating efficiency with more computerized workplace processes and practices and offers opportunities to fulfill staffs preferred working style.

Future gazing is not just about wondering if our sales will hold in the coming year, or the prediction of whether we have the right team and strategies to take the company into the future. With advancements in technology that was once dismissed as science fiction, the question becomes who will benefit, who will lose out and would it be possible to redirect paths to the innovations of the near future? Entrepreneur, Guy Kawasaki, uses the innovation of ice as an example of how industries evolve and if you are stuck in what you do, then you might not be able to “jump curves.” Guy starts his third step in, the Art of Innovation, with ice harvesting in 1800. This process evolved into ice warehouses 30 years later, which, eliminates seasonal limitations. Thirty years on and we come to the invention of the refrigerator. “the interesting thing of all is that none of these companies, the ice harvesters did not become ice factories, the ice factories did not become refrigerator companies, because most companies define themselves in terms of what they do and not the benefits they provide.”

“Innovation and the future are part of the cultural discourse.” Said Lucie Greene, Worldwide Director of the Innovation Group at J. Walter Thompson. It is not as straightforward to anticipate the path of progress. Looking past our own internalized assumptions to see the more profound shifts in cultural values and human behaviors that affect the way of innovation. ""It's about how people feel about technology, it's about how people want to live, and that's really what makes the difference."" believes Futurologist for BT, Ian Pearson. Predictions of 2019 include; 5g going full throttle, a new, global internet service from SpaceX and their launch of gigabit internet satellites, larger quantities of electric cars from Tesla, as well as the dedication to electric vehicles at Volvo. By 2021 it is predicted that fully automated cars will be on the roads.

The future is in the hands of technology and social change. Survival is more than just how technology can advance your company but about the people who work for the company, about the customers who believe in your product and how your company affects the world as a whole. So, as the world changes, as technology develops and innovations are produced, companies need to move with the times to have a future.",None
"There has been a lot of commentary recently about the rise of nationalism and threats to the Rules Based International Order. Rightly so –  CTD Advisors recently cited these trends as posing significant risks for both global security and global prosperity in the coming decade.

But, paradoxically perhaps, there are deeper – and less well documented - threats to the Nation State itself. We have become used to the concept of sovereign states and to the idea of Governments being all powerful. But the current system of international governance dates back less than 400 years to the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648, a relatively short period in human history.

It is true that the number of countries in the world has grown rapidly, from 70 in 1945 to 193 today. But that is as much a sign of weakness of the Nation State as its strength. The new countries (South Sudan, Montenegro, East Timor) are all breakaways from previously sovereign countries.

When I worked in the United States as British Ambassador to the UN, I often asked American friends ‘do you think the US will exist within its current borders in 100 years’ time?’. The answer was invariably ‘yes, of course’.  But historians would argue that this is most unlikely.  The US is less than 250 years old, and has already undergone 13 major territorial changes.  Alaska only became part of the USA 150 years ago and Hawaii 60 years ago.  And, as recently as 2009, America ceded 6 small islands in the Rio Grande to Mexico – hardly a massive change of territory, but it does demonstrate that borders are not immutable.

But this is not a US issue, it is a wider one.   Consider the pressures on today’s Nation States:

are increasingly banding together to increase their influence or is the most developed example for Brexit in 2016). But every region of the world is following the EU example to some degree.  At the same time, there is a strong popular demand for decisions to be taken at lower levels than central government.  At the extreme, this has fuelled independence movements in Scotland, Quebec, Catalonia and Western Sahara, not to mention Palestine and Kosovo. Less dramatically, we see devolution of powers in most , and regular tension between the centre and outlying – California has sued the US federal Government 44 times in the last 2 years!  The biggest tech companies are now richer than most countries, and foreign Governments find it very difficult to tax them Internet does not respect borders.  Governments that try to control the flow of information into their territory find it virtually impossible .  There was a time when Governments were the ‘first to know’. No longer – social media has become a powerful factor in all democracies.  Religion:  all religions are transnational, but recent events have emphasised how the Muslim Ummah over the Nation State.  Migration: we are in an age of mass movements across borders as people flee conflict or persecution, or simply look for a better life.  With population growth now almost entirely in the global South, this

There are other pressures too, such as crypto-currencies and non-state militias that challenge the State’s traditional monopoly of currency and force; or artificial intelligence, whose decision-making role will increase significantly in the next few years.

Some of these pressures have been around for hundreds of years, but others are new and more difficult to predict.  I find it helpful to think of the Nation State as an egg – surprisingly resilient against symmetrical pressures, but very vulnerable to asymmetric shocks.

If the Nation State system of governance were to come to an end, what would take its place? That takes us into the realm of even greater speculation.  Fiction offers some ideas – a World Government depicted in much science fiction; huge competing blocs, as in George Orwell’s 1984; the return of empires or the city state system of medieval Europe; or post- apocalyptic tribal units beloved of film writers.  None of these alternatives currently looks at all likely, but I think it unwise to assume that the current Nation State system will inevitably exist in 100 years time.",None
"Everyone wants to start the year strong; unfortunately, most people don’t really know where to begin. Most start with high hopes and unrealistic expectations and then abandon their goals before the confetti has time to settle. My theme for 2019 is simplicity. When I was younger and new in the field, I thought I had to impress people with how much I knew or how much new information I could throw at them. The older and more experienced I get, the more I realize how impactful and effective it is to keep things simple. At the end of the day, my clients and audiences are happy when they get results, and results are exactly what simplicity delivers. Let’s focus on a very simple and effective three-step method of starting the year out with tremendous momentum and—here’s the hard part—keeping it up.

Step One—FORGET: Over the last few weeks, I am fairly sure most of us have eaten too much, allowed ourselves a little more than usual to drink and heard all kinds of good advice on how to get the new year off to a great start. Starting today, I want you to FORGET what you have done and heard. Forget the good, forget the bad, and please forget all those New Year’s resolutions you have made. I want you to begin 2019 with a clean slate. Forgetting 2018 will actually help you get a more strategic beginning to 2019.

Step Two—ATTACK TWO THINGS: Choose your one most important activity for your professional success this year, as well as the single most important activity that will promote success in your personal life. Yes, I know that you probably have several extremely important activities you want to tackle for your professional and personal success, but I know from experience that most people pile their “wish lists” so high that they end up neglecting the most important activity. Keep it simple. Force yourself to stick to one activity for your professional success and one for your personal success.

Professionally speaking, this year I am going to spend 30 minutes each morning writing (I have a new book coming out at the end of 2019, and committing 30 minutes daily will go a long way toward putting together a really strong product). On the personal side, I am going to commit to taking my wife on a date at least three times monthly and also having one date with each of my kids every two months (I have found these one-on-one dates to be very effective at keeping my marriage strong, as well as helping me stay connected to my children).

Step Three—REPEAT STEP TWO: For simplicity sake, we are not going to worry about a third step. If you will crush your two most important activities consistently (one professional and one personal), I guarantee you will create great momentum and sustainability for having a successful 2019.

Remember, success doesn’t need to be complicated. Let’s keep it simple this year. Make these two activities your number one priority. I challenge you to write down on paper the two activities you are going to attack. Once you have your two commitments written down, next I want you to post them on a wall some place where you will see them daily. Finally, take a moment to block off in your calendar the days and times each month you will complete them. Doing so will help you remember and execute. Don’t skip this step.

Start nailing your two commitments immediately, and you will like the momentum it creates toward having a great 2019. This will not be easy, but you can do it. If you get off track...FORGET…and then get back on track and attack your commitments immediately. This year, I challenge you to commit to simplifying.",None
"A new year fills us with new hopes,

Are disasters & election hacking on their way?

Are major cyber attacks here to stay?

This series was not intended to shatter your New Year's celebration but rather, it was intended to instil you with some powerful self-awareness and willpower to take action this year.

In Part 1, I state my belief that a major cyber attack will strike in 2019.  I also begin to describe Category 1 cyber attacks, which are a national cyber emergency with consequences as severe as the potential loss of life.  In Part 2, I discussed the detrimental effect of election hacking.

Considering our rapidly advancing world, perhaps it's not so unbelievable why I began Part 1 with this prediction of Category 1 and Category 2 attacks:

""I believe a major cyber attack is on its way in 2019, causing disruption and devastation.  The only limitation will be the attacker's imagination.""

We must keep our fingers on the pulse! This year will bring us lightning speed 5G technology, advancements in drone technology, smart cities, driverless cars, artificial intelligence, blockchain, the Internet of Things (IoT), and more! But these will also increase the threat landscape to our Critical National Infrastructure (CNI).  During 2019, we must understand the value and importance of our assets, as well as the potential threats should a cyber attack take place.  Then, investments must be made in a strong cyber security strategy.  For comprehensive information, see my article: ""3 Reasons to Invest in Cyber Security"" – Coming soon.

Once a security investment has been established, governments, private industry and academic bodies must continue to actively collaborate and educate each other, as well as the general public. Evidently, we must raise the awareness of the importance of cyber security, especially as systems may be tied to Category 1 attacks with the potential to undermine electoral systems (as discussed in Part 2).

Election processes must be protected. To avoid compromised electoral systems, their infrastructure must be assessed at regular intervals.  This involves public statements being made by political parties in order to discourage threat actors and educate voters about disinformation campaigns.  The political parties, their candidates, staff and volunteers must be trained and supported to better protect their campaigns.  Additionally, if it was made mandatory for donors to review and accept some form of basic cyber hygiene certificate from the political party, this would encourage security to be adopted.

It only takes one small weakness to allow an attacker to create a giant problem—potentially even a global problem. A significant portion of a country's vulnerability to attack stems from a lack of security education and budget (although money for bailouts doesn't seem to be a problem!).  Are these really valid reasons for not integrating some form of nationwide cyber security training?  Or is it the case that we are willing to accept a Category 1 cyber attack that may potentially encourage the breakout of war?  The bottom line is that cyber security strategies will help to usher in a bright 2019 for us all; consider making it a part of your New Year’s resolution.",None
"On December 31, 2017, some of us sat for dinner at a friend's home and shared our New Year's resolutions; mine was to lengthen the duration of my daily meditations. Today, a year later, I assessed myself. Was I successful in keeping my New Year's resolution?

This was a very productive year for me and for IPL. But the growing demands on my time made it a challenge to grow the length of my daily meditations. I was feeling somewhat despondent at this failure when a thought flashed in my mind: ""This year, you may not have put more moments in your meditation, but you did in fact put more meditation in your moments.""

That gave me pause. I reflected. And then I realized: This is in fact quite true. There was a strong yearning I felt throughout the year to lengthen my meditations, and whenever my efforts were thwarted on a given day, it led me to strive harder to bring a meditation-like focus to all other activities I pursued that day. As a result, I felt a subtle but tangible growth in my mental alertness and joyful engagement during the year, and in the alignment between my everyday intentions and thoughts, my everyday thoughts and words, and my everyday words and actions. My highest potential may still be countless miles away, but I do feel a few inches closer.

This does not do away with the imperative of increasing the duration of my daily meditations, but it does add a complementary aspiration we can all take on when cultivating a personal leadership strength. Often, in pursuing growth, we confine ourselves to doing better in crucial moments: being resilient in adversity, speaking with impact when we are presenting to an audience, inspiring our team when they are not bought into the vision, strengthening trust with key stakeholders, or staying cool under fire. But it is also of great value to put our life under a microscope and examine how many of our everyday moments are being infused with this same striving. Are we, in these casual settings, practicing resilience? Speaking with impact? Inspiring others? Fostering trust? Staying cool?

So perhaps there is a new metric we can all use to assess our progress on whatever goal we set for ourselves. Not about how many moments of greatness we have practiced, but how much greatness we have practiced in our moments.

So that is my wish for you in the year ahead, drawn from the silver lining I found from my own cloudy conditions for growth in 2018. That, in your everyday moments, you cultivate an increasingly greater connection with your goal, whatever it may be--to increase your presence, intention, creativity, resilience, purpose, openness, joy, or compassion. It may be one small step for you, but if we all strive to do this for ourselves, what a giant leap this will be for humanity at this momentous time in history.",None
"Many startup founders dream of their business becoming the next big sensation that rakes in hundreds of millions of dollars. But problems can often arise when a blossoming business tries to scale up quickly. As I learned from growing my own company, scaling up can be an intimidating process, and if you're not ready for the change, it can come at you like a brick wall.

Here are some tips to keep in mind when you're thinking about taking your new company to the next level and you want to do it fast.

When I say your final goal, I mean your goal within a set period of time. Human nature dictates that most goals will evolve, so no goal is always final. When you're thinking about your business and how you want to scale up, do you have a foundational idea of what you want in terms of raw numbers?



Think about questions like:

All of these questions can come into play as you start to scale your startup, and knowing the answers can make the process much smoother. If your goal is to obtain 10,000 new customers a month while hiring an additional 20 staff members per month, make sure you're tracking your goal. If you just let things go on without tracking your progress, you could soon discover that you bit off more than you can chew.

For example, you may want to consider setting up a chatbot to help with the influx of new customers. According to a 2018 report on the state of chatbots, 64 percent of the consumers surveyed said that the biggest benefit of chatbots is the ability to get round-the-clock service. If you can have an ""on call"" chatbot to help with the flow of customer inquiries, you can grow exponentially, because you have one less thing to worry about in the scaling process.

It may take some time to set up these processes, but over the long term, it will likely become clear why many successful businesses are using automation tools.

Content marketing in combination with search engine optimization is one of the most scalable ways to promote your company. It provides a slow-burn effect, but once you get that fire going, your business can scale at an incredible rate. You may not get many views on your first couple of pieces of content, but once you start stacking content, linking to reputable sources, and linking to your own website, you start to build a nest of information. The more authoritative and readable your content, the higher your potential to scale up as you create.

All it takes is one piece of content that's gone viral, and before you know it, you could go from a couple thousand viewers to hundreds of thousands of viewers. As you create new content, pay attention to your new audience that's coming in, and consistently publish content.

Many consumers are looking for businesses that grow and evolve, and you have the power to make that happen for your business when you use content marketing and SEO keywords to your advantage. If all goes well, as you publish more content, you can rank higher on search engines and notice a gradual increase in your number of viewers.

It's possible for you to scale your startup fast. Just make sure you are making good decisions, understand your endgame, start automating when possible, and use scalable marketing methods like content creation and SEO to keep your business booming. Put your passion into everything you do and strive to do your best, and you, too, can have a great business that grows quickly.",None
"Every once in a great while, the Harvard Business Review publishes an article that has the potential to redefine how we think about business fundamentals, like entrepreneurism and innovation. The recently published ""The High Price of Efficiency"" is just such an article.

What It's About

One archetype of ""disruptive innovation"" is the PC, which disrupted the computer industry that was based around minicomputers and mainframes. Another archetype is the internet, which, well, supposedly disrupted everything.

There's only one problem: While innovation might (sometimes) create greater efficiency, efficiency itself makes innovation less likely by causing a concentration of profit and power for one or two companies inside each industry.

Take high tech, for instance. Google, Amazon, and Facebook completely dominate their respective markets to the point that no amount of innovation is likely to disrupt or displace them. Any startup that threatens their dominance is acquired and folded into the monopoly.

Martin cites how Waste Management completely dominates the trash-collection business, an industry that once enjoyed multiple vendors. WM is efficient--so efficient that it drives competitors out of business, even if they might provide a better service.

The same is now true in virtually every industry, which have conglomerating into one, two, or (occasionally) a handful of market participants who have achieved efficiencies of scale and thus no longer need to innovate to survive.

The dominance of these mega-corporations is astounding. As author Roger L. Martin points out, ""the 100 most profitable U.S. firms earn 84 percent of the profits of all public firms."" This was emphatically not the case 20 years ago.

While concentration of power and profit into a handful of huge ""efficient"" companies can sometimes benefit consumers in the form of lower prices, the quest for efficiency has many highly negative unintended consequences:

Social unrest. Efficiency through automation and efficiency through outsourcing result, respectively, in unemployment and slave labor (which is far more common than most people realize). The result is misery and dissatisfaction that can lead to revolutions and dictatorships.

Less entrepreneurism. There is an exact correlation between the rise of these mega-corporations in the past two decades and the decline in the number of startups, which has been steadily shrinking for years.

What We Can Do

Martin suggests that, rather than encouraging efficiency, governments should encourage ""resilience."" A resilient market would have multiple players and less concentration of profit and power, and therefore more competition and innovation.

While Martin provides several ideas for creating resilient markets, the most important is to return anti-monopoly laws to their original intent, which was to break up monopolies and thus create a more competitive (i.e., less efficient) marketplace.

That's not been the case for several decades. Rather than opposing monopolies per se, the government encourages industry consolidation if it results in lower prices, even if that consolidation decreases the tax base and creates more government expense.

The first choice is to continue to pretend that our startups can be successful in an environment where most of the profit available in every market has been sequestered by a small handful of huge companies.",None
"In the startup world, it’s part of your job to combat laziness in all its different forms, whether that’s for your team or for yourself. If you’re a founder or a team lead, it’s a matter of motivating every employee to be the best version of themselves as possible. If you’re an employee, it’s a matter of overcoming those lazy streaks to boost your own productivity.

All of us get lazy at one point or another, but nobody aspires to be lazy at work — not even poor performers. Behaviors we label as “lazy” usually stem from a complex set of root causes, as opposed to some personality trait or lack thereof. When an employee is sitting paralyzed before an empty spreadsheet, for example, that’s usually a sign of procrastination or nerves — not innate laziness.

The first step for you in motivating yourself and your team, then, is identifying what these root causes of “laziness” are so you can watch out for them.

Cause 1: Anxiety about your work not being good enough.

Employees who have a high attention to detail — who are perfectionists — are susceptible to this trap, where they become so nervous about delivering something of poor quality that they can’t work on it at all.

At our gaming studio, my co-founder, Alex, and I have hired a few people who fall into this camp. Most are incredibly talented and committed to their jobs, but they get inside their own heads, convincing themselves there’s a better way to present the information in question, or to articulate their messaging — whatever the case might be.

Which is why Alex and I have gotten into the habit of making our employees take short vacations when they begin showing this kind of behavior. It’s a matter of forcing them to detach from the task that’s stressing them out so they can return to it with a clear — and productive — mind.

If at your company you don’t have the luxury of letting certain folks take long weekends at home when necessary, try instead having more regular check-ins with them so you can keep a pulse on their more anxious tendencies and reassure them when they flare.

Cause 2: Confusion about what the first steps of a task are.

Most people need an external structure for breaking down tasks. When we launched our gaming studio, we started with a flat structure (as most startups often do). But we quickly recognized how this led to confusion, which itself negatively impacted productivity.

Having a group of four developers each breaking down their own tasks is not as effective as having a PM or a team lead helping them facilitate this process.

A formal org structure helps lend accountability to the development process and helps eliminate any laziness that may come from task confusion.

Cause 3: Feeling overwhelmed by the volume of tasks.

This is a problem leaders themselves often have. I know I do, personally — mostly because I’m bad at multitasking.

The solution is being able to say “no” to tasks that are low priority when something of higher priority needs to get done — smart prioritization, in other words.

Of course, this can be tough, and employees who struggle with it often see their productivity dip. They end up getting paralyzed thinking about all they have to do, and they end up doing none of it.

“…there are always far more problems and issues clamoring for your attention than you have the resources to address. You might feel like a firefighter, except instead of trying to extinguish a blaze in one contained spot, you can see separate fires all around you — and you don’t have time to put out all of them. One of the ways entrepreneurs can stay alive is by deciding to let certain fires burn so they can focus on the fires that, if allowed to rage unchecked, really will destroy the company.”

Employees should be encouraged to embrace this mindset. Always be working, but work on whatever’s most important in the moment.

Cause 4: Fear of asking for help.

We once had a group of junior developers who didn’t know how to use Git — which in turn impacted how much they got done — but they were too embarrassed to ask for help.

But you should also set something of an internal standard in which if an employee is stuck on any kind of project for longer than X hours, the expectation is they ask for help.

What you can’t have are team members sitting at their desk not doing what they should be because they lack critical information.

Internal strife can, of course, also affect productivity.

I know this from experience, too. Before Alex and I made a more concerted effort to be transparent in our decision-making processes, we once made a decision about a feature redesign which our team didn’t agree with.

In retrospect, it was an easy choice we made — we were under pressure to finish that particular project before the end of the year, and we simply needed to get it done — but it rubbed our team the wrong way. It made them think we didn’t value their input. From there, the team’s anger evolved from disagreement with the decision to something more personal — and our collective effectiveness ground to a halt.

Instead, combat these challenges preemptively by building systems and processes which guarantee transparency and ensure everyone on your team remains on the same page in your shared effort to drive your company forward.

Cause 6: Employees’ psychological needs aren’t being met.

This, ultimately, is the most common cause of laziness within teams. Because of that, I believe it’s critical that all founders and team leads educate themselves around what exactly employees’ psychological needs are. That starts with understanding Self-Determination Theory (SDT).

SDT says that humans have certain inherent positive features — or “growth tendencies” — yet at the same time have psychological needs which must be met in order for them to self-motivate. They are:

If you’re struggling to combat laziness in your company, read up on SDT and ask yourself: are you ensuring your employees' psychological needs are being met? Sometimes, after all, the reason for your team’s declining motivation might not be your people, but you.",None
"Do you like being manipulated? I don't know anyone who does. If this was a high school graduation speech, I'd say ""Merriam-Webster defines manipulation as ..."" but since it's not that kind of speech, I'll share my own definition: Manipulation is the other person telling you they don't care about you, your wants or needs.

Imagine that -- someone coming up to tell you they don't care about you. Yikes, that's not friendly. Who would do that? Lots of people, actually -- a lot of salespeople and businesses think it's best to manipulate you into buying their goods and services.

I recently went furniture shopping and, tired of not finding what I was looking for, I slouched down on a nearby couch. A salesperson came over and sat next to me and said: ""Comfy couch, best couch in here, you picked the right one. Should I write it up for you? Free delivery, you know."" I replied: ""It's not all that comfortable to me, to be honest, I was just taking a break."" He jumped up and declared: ""This couch? No, it's not for people like us. We want the best. Let me show you what you're looking for."" I knew at that moment it was time to leave or, at the very least, not work with this person. They couldn't have made it more obvious that they didn't care about what I wanted; it was all about them. Don't make that mistake when helping your clients.

Before we discuss how the couch example could have gone better for all those involved, let's do a quick primer on beliefs. Beliefs are a very powerful motivator. I subscribe to the idea that there are seven major belief buckets, and we carry more weight in one or two of these buckets than the others. The Personal Interests, Attitudes and Values (PIAV) assessments out there will describe them as: aesthetic, economic, individualistic, political, altruistic, regulatory and theoretical.

In the couch example, if I were evaluating couches with the aesthetic bias, I would want a couch that fits my style or decor. With an economic bias, I'd want a couch for the best deal or value. For an individualistic bias, I'd want a unique, one-of-a-kind couch. With a political bias, I might want a couch that tells people I'm an influencer and altruistic -- a couch that helps others, maybe because buying this couch gives a couch to a charity. With a regulatory bias, I'd want the same couch I had before. And with theoretical bias, I might want to know how the couch was made and understand what makes a ""better"" couch.

So, to give customers what they need, and in a way they need it, starts with knowing the ""what"" and ""how."" How do you learn all that? Well, you could simply ask. You could take an interest.

What could have made my couch-buying experience better? Maybe the salesperson could've asked: ""How will you know when you've found the right couch for you? What's most important to you?"" Now, all you have to do is listen. What do they say? Did they say they came in because of the sale (economic), because they painted the living room and the old couch doesn't match (aesthetic) or because their last couch wore out (regulatory)? Once you know some of what is driving their decision, you can really help them get what they want and, in exchange, you get what you want, too: a client.

Assessing The 'What' And 'How' Of Your Customers

Ready to jump in? Here are some ideas for next steps. Look at your client onboarding, sales and customer service processes or even e-commerce conversions. See where you can make adjustments to give the client what they want in the way they want it.

For e-commerce conversions or engagement, A/B testing is a widely used practice:

1. Craft different calls to action or use different images that leverage the seven core beliefs we talked about earlier.

2. Use A/B testing to find your audience's sweet spot.

Want a real-life example? We have a customer that uses Instagram to develop leads for a vegan food business. They use recipes and beautiful photos of the foods they prepare. Truly amazing photos. But they found little engagement, not enough ""likes."" So, using this suggestion, they challenged the belief that they needed beautiful photos. They tested a plain, unstaged, unfiltered photo. The result? Five times the engagement, five times the number of ""likes."" Consumers found they were more believable because they saw something they could do vs. professional quality food. Their audience basically said: ""Hey, that's something I can make. I can do that!"" So the client moved from the aesthetic belief to the regulatory belief and it worked.

Here are some other A/B tests and messages a business like this could run to gauge what customers want:

Aesthetic: ""Look at this amazing image of our food""

Individualistic: ""Stand out in a crowd with these recipes""

Political: ""Be the first to make this recipe for your friends""

Regulatory: ""Add this habit to your weekly meal preps""

You will win way more new business by packaging your unique offering in a way that can easily be understood and appreciated by the consumer based on their beliefs. Listen to cues to what's most important to your consumer, then present your perfect solution in terms that match. Focus on what's important to them versus what you want.",None
"Kelly Palmer, the former Chief Learning Officer at Linkedin and current Chief Learning Officer of education technology company Degreed, has been hard at work studying what professional skills are required to help organizations hire and retain the best talent. She is determined to shift the way the world learns and refocus organizational thinking onto being able to leverage unique abilities rather than the status quo—like university degrees and titles.

In her new book, The Expertise Economy, Palmer and her co-author, David Blake, state that it’s actually our distinct expertise (our skill-sets) that makes us marketable for any job we desire. The traditional way of hiring and structuring organizations is based on accomplishments such as which college you graduated from and what previous jobs you’ve held. However, in what Palmer and Blake call the “expertise economy,” skills are actually the currency with which candidates can navigate within an organization. Instead of workers talking about their trajectory based on roles or credentials, they should, instead, think about what it is that they would like to be doing with the skills they have. For example, if an employee is highly empathetic but also a great programmer with top leadership skills, he or she might be able to make use of those skills in ways that may not have been possible had that individual been hired to only to program. The times are shifting and the future of work is becoming more about our diverse and unique skill sets than our static roles and traditional hierarchies as we know them in the corporate world.

In another example, Palmer states that: no longer will roles be confined to one set of criteria but, rather, curiosity will lead the definition of what a role might be. For example, if someone is interested in leadership and has a unique skill set that applies to multiple functions, a compound role could be created that allows the individual to rotate positions and leverage multiple skills and sets of expertise that utilize different strengths. This kind of “gig economy” would allow major corporations to use skills to play as a strategic lever for any business strategy—and it would not have to be just part of the learning platform but could be leveraged in any scenario.

As more and more companies big and small are transforming their employees into experts, the professional development opportunities needs to shift as well. The current professional development curriculum is more about directed learning—compliance training, learning roadmaps, and competency models—that meet current developmental criteria for performance. Yet “learning is about curiosity. It’s about going back to basics and looking at what really motivates people to learn and then empowering them to do it,” says Palmer. To accomplish this, the culture of learning within organizations will have to shift from compliance requirements and lecture-based approaches to expanding and building on what employees are most curious about. “People want to have control over how they learn and what they learn, and they want to feel like they have a sense of autonomy with what they do,” says Palmer. How that is done can differ from company to company, but it’s likely going to be about what that person is interested in and how those interests are going to contribute to their personal development as a whole, both inside and outside of work.

“Most CEOs think that they will need to re-skill a quarter of their workforce to be “‘future-ready,’ says Palmer. “It’s imperative that we look at this from a company perspective and empower workers to think about what’s next and not wait for an opportunity to land at their feet.”

Building, what are considered “soft skills,” like empathy and creativity, will be key to the success of future organizations. “We need to focus on how we will evolve as humans to work with technology. We are already seeing automation, robots and other technological advances doing many things that humans once did. The question is, What is our place in that model? We can continue to add value by using those types of human skills as we work side by side with AI and technology. We must also focus on  learning agility—the ability to continuously learn new skills. People who can keep up and build new skills quickly will be in high demand in the workforce, “ says Palmer.

How we tell our stories is going to have shift as well. “Currently, when asked about our education, we talk about our university degree, but the goal should be for us to discuss our skills, what is it that we are best at and how those skills come together for the opportunities at hand,” says Palmer.

Palmer believes there are three ways leaders can begin to shift their organizational thinking away from traditional modes and more toward a future that looks at our unique abilities:

“When I was at LinkedIn, we made sure that learning was part of everything we did and built into the overall culture of the company, says Palmer. “We talked about learning when we recruited people, when we onboarded new employees, and when we developed our managers and leaders. We talked about it at our all all-hands meetings and staff meetings. Everyone knew that learning was key to the value proposition at LinkedIn, and our goal was to help employees transform the trajectory of their careers through learning while at LinkedIn.

“David Blake and I developed a model for understanding the skills you have versus the skills you need to be successful in the future to help your company succeed. We call this the ‘Skills Quotient’ and it’s a great way to help people, organizations, and companies understand where there are skills gaps, so they can put a business plan in place to address those gaps. We are currently working with several companies to help them identify and develop their skills strategies using the Skills Quotient so they can up-skill and re-skill their workforce,” says Palmer.

For example, Tim Munden, Unilever’s CLO, is creating a skills-focused learning strategy for more than 161,000 employees around the globe—not part of a separate learning strategy but as one that is integrated into the company’s overall digital transformation initiatives. At the core of that strategy is asking the question, “Do our employees have the skills they need to be successful?” Employees need to be asking themselves that same question as well.",None
"The 2016 elections and their aftermaths made it painfully clear that we are a long way from a world that’s free from gender bias. But since those elections, historic numbers of women and their allies gathered to speak out for women’s rights. Today, a record number of women will be sworn in to Congress.

That is important for everyone, not only for women. Women legislators are more likely to introduce bills important to women and families on issues such as child welfare and education -- and there is abundant research suggesting that a Congress with greater gender equity will also make better decisions about every issue, from defense to economic policy to civil rights protections.

Recent psychology research shows that groups with greater gender equity make better decisions. In business, one study shows that gender-diverse teams make better decisions 15% more often than all-male teams. Another study showed that research and development teams that were more gender-balanced were more likely to find radically innovative solutions to problems.

A larger proportion of women in decision-making bodies also magnifies the impact of individual women. Studies of women working in male-dominated fields like engineering show that when women have a critical mass of representation in working groups and the presence of role models, there is more active problem-solving within the group. I hope that the increased number of women in Congress also leads to more gender equity in our legislature itself, so that more people feel comfortable speaking out against inherent bias and are empowered to push for better solutions.

Gender equity is, of course, only one dimension of the diversity that creates better decisions. For example, studies have shown that jurors on racially diverse juries discussed more case facts and recalled the facts of their cases more accurately. In business, research shows that companies that have more ethnically diverse leadership teams are more likely to outperform competition.

Taken together, these analyses suggest that the quality of a group’s decisions increases with the diversity of perspectives in the group and the degree to which differing perspectives are included and weighed equally in the decision-making process.

It is interesting to note that research does not suggest that inclusive decision-making is easier. In fact, studies show that diverse groups tend to disagree more and feel less confident in their decisions. But their decisions are more effective.

Those of us who seek effective decision-making in our legislature should continue to advocate for diversity and support those lawmakers who achieve progress, regardless of gender.

Our legislators can also demonstrate the power of inclusive decision making by moving forward on broadly supported policy changes, such as protections for DACA recipients, on which people of varied political viewpoints and backgrounds have found common ground and where there is clear positive impact on the affected individuals’ educational outcomes and on the capacity of our future workforce.

By doing so, our new legislators have the power to create change   show the power of building common ground among those of diverse views and backgrounds.  In both ways, they could indeed make a meaningful difference in Congress.",None
"You're probably familiar with Malcolm Gladwell's famous 10,000-hour rule. It states that if you want to master any complicated skill, from golf to violin, you're going to have to put in that many hours of practice. For the time-strapped, it's pretty dispiriting. Who has 10,000 hours to spare?

The researchers whose work Gladwell based his famous dictum on have disputed his ""rule."" Talent matters too, they've pointed out, as does the way you practice (simply racking up the hours won't cut it). Which is fascinating, but not helpful for those of us hoping for a way around spending more than a year's worth of hours mastering a new skill.

But at least one author thinks he's found a shortcut. Josh Kaufman, author of The First 20 Hours: How to Learn Anything . . . Fast! , broke down the basics of his method into four steps for TED Ideas recently. Put his method into practice and you can learn any skill by putting in just 45 minutes a day for a month, he promises.

""The first thing you need to do is to decide what you want to learn, and then break it down into smaller, manageable pieces. Let's say you want to bake your own bread. It's a multi-step process that includes making dough, letting it rise, punching it down, shaping it into a loaf, and baking it in the oven. You'll start by identifying the different tools and skills behind each step,"" writes TED's Mary Halton, explaining Kaufman's first insight.

2. Learn the basic theory ... but no procrastinating!

OK, now you know what you need to learn, but before you dive into actual practice, you need to understand the basic theory behind whatever you're undertaking. The key here is to inform yourself adequately without wasting time. Resist the temptation to study everything under the sun on your new skill.

""Get three to five resources about what it is you're trying to learn,"" Kaufman recommends. ""It could be books, it could be DVDs, it could be anything, but don't use those as a way to procrastinate.""

Humans are naturally lazy creatures who will latch onto any possible excuse to avoid effortful practice. So consciously remove every barrier that will keep you from putting in 45 minutes a day -- hide your phone, enlist a friend to hold you accountable, or even bribe yourself by bundling your practice with something you love, suggests TED.

""To overcome what Kaufman calls the 'frustration barrier' -- that period in the beginning when you're painfully incompetent and you know it -- you must commit to sticking with your new activity for at least 20 hours. By that point, he says, 'you will be astounded at how good you are,'"" reports TED.

After 20 hours will you we playing Rachmaninoff, beating Tiger Woods on the links, or speaking fluent Arabic? I, for one, am highly skeptical. But you probably will make sufficient progress that you'll be motivated to continue working on your chosen skill. From there, anything is possible, so Kaufman's method might be worth a try.",None

Delta and United Airlines pilots -- and those of JetBlue and many other airlines -- have had enough.

In a scorchingly fact-based letter to President Trump, the Air Line Pilots Association -- which represents 61,000 pilots -- used simple words.

I am writing to urge you to take the necessary steps to immediately end the shutdown of government agencies that is adversely affecting the safety, security and efficiency of our national airspace system.

Moreover, CNN now reports that hundreds of TSA screeners are calling in sick. Could the fact that they're not being paid have an influence?

The pressure these civil servants are facing at home should not be ignored. At some point, these dedicated federal employees will encounter personal financial damages that will take a long time from which to recover, if at all.

By writing directly to the president -- and merely copying congressional leaders -- the pilots appear to be holding him responsible for the potential dangers flowing from the shutdown.

It's a remarkably forthright approach, one that might make some uncomfortable, given that it has inevitable political overtones.

By saying that only the president can and should take the necessary steps, the pilots seem to recognize that, whatever the merits (or demerits) of a wall, it isn't worth risking airline safety for what some believe is a symbol of power rather than an effective security measure.

It makes sense that companies are staffing up within marketing. As the co-founder and CEO of Aha!, I can say that investing in marketing has always been a priority. We look for people with deep expertise in their discipline, whether it is digital or content or product marketing. However, we also look for broader skills that indicate how well a marketer will perform in their role.

If you want to succeed in marketing, you need to be relentlessly curious. This is because you need to deeply understand your customer and their pain points. Are you really giving them what they need? Are you crafting the right messages, communicating through the right channels? To develop this way of thinking, make it a daily practice to question everything -- be curious about what has (or has not) worked in the past and what you could be doing better.

Marketers need to be master communicators, clearly conveying a company's message to teammates and customers. Start by developing your own message. If you are searching for a job, think about how you want to position your career -- how you got to where you are, your greatest challenges, and how you have overcome them. Then, practice communicating this story. It could be as simple as telling your story to a friend or writing a new cover letter.

Marketing requires a great deal of teamwork -- not just across the organization, but also within the overall marketing team. Seek out the people around you and ask for feedback on what you are working on now, whether it is a project with your current job or maybe even your resume. Be open to hearing critical feedback and acting on it.

As a marketer, you need to know how to seek out fresh ideas and solutions on a regular basis. So, push yourself to get more creative right now. This might mean reading a book you would have never picked up before or taking on a challenging new hobby (language lessons, for example). The point is to challenge your old views and start seeing the world in new ways.

It does not matter if you are a marketing generalist or if you specialize in product, digital, or content marketing -- you need to be both strategic and innovative. The above skills will help you find that balance. Start fine-tuning now and you will put yourself in the best position to be hired this year.",None
"Remember when you planned your next steps after high school? It was probably a fairly straightforward chicken and egg choice – preferences and skills typically drive career selection. It is logical enough. Every day, businesses welcome new graduates – from all kinds of educational programs – and they hope they select well and effectively match candidate talents with job requirements.

Snagging the best and the brightest continues to be a challenge because of the demand for skills and the limited supply of workers:

It is long-accepted that personality shapes our decisions about our career path. In fact, no matter your age, you were probably instructed to consider your preferences, your strengths and your aptitudes in selecting a career. A classic book Do What You Love, the Money Will Follow reinforced that message.

But, new research from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign points to the effect career choice has on personality. Rather than the chicken and the egg, the study focuses on the egg’s relationship to the chicken. It turns out when people choose a certain job path, it tends to shift their self-reported personality characteristics. Goethe said it well: “We are shaped and fashioned by what we love.”and apparently also by what we do.

The study is relevant for leaders and teams because success at the organizational level is driven by people who fully use their gifts and talents. The implications seem obvious, but there is a counter-intuitive way of thinking about things as well. More on that in a moment.

First, if you believe personality should dictate career choice, leaders are wise to:

But what if there is another alternative? In his book, Steal Like an Artist, Austin Kleon points out, “When the world looks different, our brains work harder.” When our brains work harder and when we are stretched and challenged, we are more likely to stay stimulated, interested and engaged. This is good for people and good for companies.

Perhaps it is better for companies to encourage people to shake up their choices and stretch their preferences. With this thinking, leaders should:

Is it a chicken or an egg? It’s probably both. The career-personality/personality-career debate must end with opportunities. That is, plenty of opportunities for employees to go deep and go broad with their contributions and to excel at the familiar while also stretching toward new challenges.",None

"If the performance review process makes you cringe, you’re not alone.

According to research my company conducted, only 32.5% of America’s workforce is actually satisfied with this aspect of work. It comes as no surprise that several management gurus, including Peter Cappelli and Anna Tavis, advocate for upending the performance review process entirely. Regardless of your perspective, the fact that only three in 10 workers prefer the status quo should capture the attention of every manager looking to attract and retain the best and brightest.

Especially in today’s tight labor market, managers must do more to keep their employees satisfied. With unemployment rates now at historic lows, people have more opportunities than they have had in years and are leaving their jobs at the fastest pace in nearly two decades.

Some things about working for a living lie outside the manager’s control. But they should not leave any elements of the work experience they can control to chance, including the performance review process. It doesn't have to be the soul-crushing, disengaging, disheartening experience so many of us have had to endure; instead, this process can be part of a strong bond between managers and employees.

On that note, here are three direct steps that managers can take to improve this work ritual.

Get to know who your reports are as people, including their interests, why they chose your company and what they like about their job. And spend enough time with them to have a window into their work, team dynamics, and the ups and downs of the projects that they are involved in or lead.

Among the many benefits, this kind of relationship building can make hard conversations easier. In a performance review, that sometimes means discussing underperformance and the need to take significant steps to get up to speed. Most adults take constructive criticism better when it comes from someone who they trust and know has their best interests at heart. With a positive relationship, the tough conversations have a better chance of success; taking time to build strong bonds will mean fewer difficult conversations in the first place.

Begin by asking what they thought went well and acknowledge projects that had a significant business impact like surpassed revenue targets, success stories with customers and clients, and the positive roles they play on the team.

Another essential part of the conversation should focus on improvement. Ask what, from their perspective, could have gone better and what they might do differently in a similar situation down the road, given the benefit of hindsight. Look for the ability to accurately assess their own performance and their willingness to embrace feedback. And make sure to document commitments made on both sides.

You can also make these reviews forward-looking by talking about the future and leveraging earlier conversations regarding career aspirations. This is not a substitute for a formal developmental discussion to be had separately. Make clear your willingness to help them be successful, now and in the future. Look for ways to link what they would like to learn or experience to the deliverables you have and express an assignment as a developmental opportunity for them.

Finally, end with an acknowledgment of their contribution. Sometimes, it’s as simple as saying, “Thank you for having worked hard and having delivered quality work."" You will probably never know the sacrifices they had to make to deliver a project on time or finish an analysis in order not to let you down. The choice to do that only comes from an employee who believes in your faith in them.

The performance review is not a “one-and-done” process. It entails ongoing conversations about performance, development, performance and development -- think “lather, rinse, repeat.” Follow up and act on the steps you vowed to take. In formal and informal conversations, you must help people see how the “what” of their job links to the “who” of the person standing in front of you.

Instead of holding one organization-mandated, big conversation annually, consider conducting a series of smaller reviews. And keep good notes so that you retain a strong sense of their contributions throughout the year and have details at hand during ongoing review meetings. While no magic number exists, managers may want to set quarterly reviews to help foster continuous improvement and development. Research has shown that multiple conversations lead to better performance.

It’s important to get the performance review process right, and not simply because the labor market will further tighten, which will only heighten the challenges around retaining talent. More importantly, it will help you keep good people, because everyone deserves an excellent manager.",wellness
"The discovery dimension of higher education mostly involves basic research, but sometimes out of scientific inquiry comes valuable commercial applications. Once most research was conducted by lonely individual researchers with perhaps one or two assistants, but as scientific inquiry has become more complex, lots of expensive equipment are used by teams of scientists, often from multiple universities. Two senior researchers, one from the University of Wisconsin and the second from Washington University in St. Louis, had a breakthrough doing research conducted on kidney disease in the 1990s that resulted in the drug Zemplar. (Full disclosure: this author has lectured at both universities, and served as a visiting professor at Washington University in the mid-1990s).

Although apparently federal research money was involved, since the Bayh-Dole Act was enacted in 1980 it is possible for universities and their researchers to share in the fruits of patents. Our nation's extraordinary inventiveness and innovation reflect a solid constitutional basis; Article I, section 8 gives Congress the power ""To... promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries...""  Throughout American history, tinkerers and scientists have been incentivized by their attainment of intellectual property rights, providing royalties from their discoveries.

But the process of obtaining and enforcing patent rights is complicated these days, particularly when multiple scientists and universities are involved. Washington University and Wisconsin agreed that a research foundation affiliated with Wisconsin would administer the patent and the funds derived from it. Over the years, the success of Zemplar has brought literally hundreds of millions of dollars to Abbott Laboratories and later its spinoff AbbVie. Under the provisions of Bayh-Dole, the two universities and their scientists were slated to share in the largess. I do not know the details of the dispute, but the federal judge overseeing it ruled that the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation had inappropriately siphoned a disproportionate part of the patent royalties to Wisconsin and that it owed Washington U. $31.6 million.

Scientific discovery is a bit like oil prospecting. There are a lot of dry holes, but the occasional home run discovery makes the quest for patents generally worthwhile financially. My university, Ohio University, is a mid-size research operation but generates far more royalty income from discoveries than its much larger neighbor, Ohio State, simply because of a very successful discovery of a human growth hormone drug. The University of Florida at last report had collected $281 million from the invention of Gatorade.

Even more important to most universities than royalty income, however, is the overhead money that they receive from federal research grants. I have earlier argued that this system is ripe for reform, but at present billions of dollars from research grants help fund the burgeoning bureaucracies endemic to major American universities and provide perks for key professors. Data on faculty salaries suggest those who are strong in making research contributions generally fare far better financially than those whose strength comes from dedication to teaching.

Is the current system optimal? There is some evidence the U.S. is losing its high technology lead to other nations, especially China, that are devoting increasing resources to improving the quality and quantity of scientific research. It can be argued that our nation is spending too much for current consumption and spending too little on improving our future standard of living through investment (machines, buildings, and research). This might be a case for greater funding of the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, etc. Countering this, however, diminishing returns apply to research like they do to most other things, so doubling the amount spent on funding research will not likely double real increases in new discoveries. Also, there appears to be a good deal of economic rent associated with research: payments to individuals resulting in little or no increase in outcomes.

One final thought. The winner in this latest research battle, Washington University in St. Louis, is distinctly not an athletic power, unlike the University of Wisconsin, a member of one of the greatest groupings of schools (the Big Ten) in American intercollegiate athletics. There are other paths to wealth and recognition ---one can gain them in the laboratories and libraries as well as on the playing field.",None
"Personality tests continue to be a popular tool, with many companies requiring their employees to fill out lengthy questionnaires. This is often an effort to better understand their workers so they can, in turn, better manage and communicate with them.

But are the tests really a good indicator of how a candidate would perform in the organization? While some argue that personality tests are helpful, they may not be completely accurate: Because results are often publicly shared, employees may offer skewed answers to get a ""better"" personality type.

The experts at Forbes Human Resources Council shared their thoughts on how important personality tests are in predicting performance or cultural fit — and whether they should be used at all.

1. You Need To Define Your Culture First

Personality tests provide a decent match for specific positions and cultural fit if the company has accurately defined its culture. HR departments should collect personality data from current employees to identify trends in their workforce. These trends can then be compared against personality tests to find which candidates would be the best fit. - Tiffany Jensen, Pure Grips

Personality tests are inconsistent indicators of performance and intellectual ability. They introduce risks of legal defensibility when used in business settings. Competency and cognitive testing as well as case studies are empirically better ways of evaluating performance capability. Cultural fit is better assessed with structured interviews and in-depth reference checking. - Keith Kefgen, AETHOS Consulting Group

While I'm a fan of personality tests, they don't tell everything about a person or how well he or she may fit into the work culture. When you take time to understand someone's personality, you know how to best manage them, how they communicate, what motivates them and how they may react to change or conflict. A personality test won't tell you how to interact in a way that helps your team succeed. - Michele Markey, SkillPath

Personality tests require validation in the context of the organization's culture for them to be good indicators of expected outcomes. I believe we live in a dynamic world making these tests a poor indicator of the expected outcomes. New tools using machine learning and AI could be deployed for candidates. The key is to know what needs to be tested. - Sanjeev Sahgal, worldbank.org

5. Personality Tests Are Only One Data Point

An organization needs to define its culture and identify the competencies that are important for success. A personality test should be used as one data point to help identify how an individual could be successful based on the position and with the company's environment. Organizations need to be mindful that personality tests do not discriminate and are free from bias. - Sherry Martin, OmniTRAX

Personality is a stable property that is shaped and evolved over the course of life and personal experiences. This is very different from a skill set, which can usually be shaped/trained in a short amount of time. Personality tests are a useful litmus test in the hiring process since culture fit is important to individual, team and company success. - Steven Jiang, Hiretual

Personality tests are not a good measure of performance, potential or fit. These have biases no matter how you look at it. Even with a test that tries to eliminate as much bias as possible, the people looking at the tests are biased. Also, it decreases diversity because you are hiring people with the same types of personalities. This is unproductive. - Lotus Yon, NCH

8. You Should Have Your Existing Employees Gauge A New Hire's Fit

A personality test is like the old BCS formula that decided who would compete for a national championship in college football. It was black and white and didn't account for a lot of intangibles. Most decided it was a failure early on, and it was finally declared a failure by the people who created it. Use your own employees — they're ingrained in the culture already and know what to look for. - Evan Lassiter, Contino

Personality tests serve as inventories that provide insights into innate behavior. It's best to use responses as indicators of where to probe in an interview. For example, if someone rates low on flexibility, yet your culture is loose and entrepreneurial, it’s a cue to talk about how they will perform in that environment. Use assessments as guides, not rules for immediate judgment of candidates. - Stacey Browning, Paycor

10. Candidates Might Tell You What They Think You Want To Hear

Personality tests are useful for collecting data, but formal testing or interviewing can inadvertently motivate candidates to answer questions based on what they think the organization wants to hear, not based on how they really feel. The more relaxed the environment is for the candidate, the more likely the individual interviewing will be the same person who shows up to work on day one. - Dr. Timothy J. Giardino, Cantata Health, LLC

11. Ask Follow-Up Questions To Get A Better Picture Of Candidates

I believe personality tests provide a simple data point as to how a candidate would perform in an organization and ultimately impact the culture. That said I believe before using it as a determining factor in any way it is our job as hiring managers to ask follow-up questions with the candidate with regard to the results. Personality tests are better conversation starters vs. pure indicators. - Max Hansen, Y Scouts

12. Tests Tell You Where Candidates Are Weak Or Strong In Your Culture

Personality assessments will not tell you how well a candidate will perform, but will provide information on where the candidate may be weak or strong in the company culture. These types of assessments should be used as a guide only to allow employers to ask questions in areas that may be weak or overly strong. These types of assessments should not be used to make actual hiring decisions. - Charmaine Smith Winters, Samsung Austin Semiconductor

Personality tests provide interesting individual insights and can help improve communication and collaboration among team members. However, they should not be the deciding factor for recruiters. Understanding a person’s strengths, cultural fit and level of commitment, should be of far greater importance to managers when selecting their next team member. - Lisa Sterling, Ceridian",None
"Let’s be perfectly honest. Are you taking on projects that you know you can’t fail? Do you choose assignments where the risks won’t expose you? Do you wait for people to give you feedback, but don't ask for it? These are all part of a great strategy to pretend we are awesome yet never really find out what we are made of.

Welcome to the land of mediocrity: It’s comfortable, easy and contagious.

Mediocracy is a conspiracy. It's a pact we join with others so that we don’t have to admit that we could be doing so much better.

The greatest part about conspiring to be mediocre is that we all get to think we’re quite ... excellent! Finding out what we need to do to be better, finding out how far away we are from our true potential, and being confronted with what we must start and what we must stop would require a level of vulnerability most of us are too afraid to face. Wanting something more than mediocrity requires a level of courage to take actions we have never taken before. Mediocrity prevents us from going out there and failing forward.

In order to break the “spell” of mediocrity, we must find out how we ended up here, own it and take new actions.

We often tell ourselves that if we take risks or hear what people think of us, we might look bad. And we don't want to look bad.

So, we stop ourselves from looking bad by ensuring we don’t fail. We don't ask how we're doing. We create a life of mediocrity and numbness, and succumb to a life of being ""quite comfortable.”

Why it's wrong: Embracing failure is a skill that the best leaders and teams practice. Failure means you are learning, fighting the good fight and becoming braver, wiser and stronger. Failure is your best teacher. We need to stop playing it safe for fear that “they” might really find out about what we are made of.

Reason No. 2: We don’t want to admit we need other people to succeed.

We all believe that to need someone to be successful, accomplish great things or fulfill our dreams is to admit we are weak. Rather than admitting we are weak, we choose mediocrity.

We would never say, “I need you. I won’t be able to accomplish this project that I am passionate about without you.” We would feel too vulnerable to state what we are passionate about and to ask for help in achieving our passion.

So, we go at it alone. We go at it alone in our relationships with our partners. We go at it alone when we're surrounded by 10 to 12 of our “teammates.” We're even surrounded by others who go at it alone.

Why it's wrong: You are only as good as the support you have around you. So if you aren’t willing to admit that you need other people to be successful, let’s just face the truth: You aren't courageous enough to find something so important that you need other people to join you. Instead of choosing courage, you choose mediocrity.

Reason No. 3: We are afraid to be vulnerable.

Your friends (some of whom you may have known for just a few days) know more about your flaws than you, yourself, have discovered over the many decades of your life. But guess what? They won’t tell you. Your parents know these flaws too, and they aren’t going to tell you either. Your co-workers, also caught up in mediocrity, aren't going to tell you either. And here’s the catch: We don’t want to ask them anyways.

Asking for the truth about us forces us to vulnerably face our flaws. We would find out the most horrible truth that all human beings must deal with every day: that we aren’t as perfect as we think we are. And, if we had flaws (spoiler alert: we do), we would have to change our actions.

So, choosing to be completely clueless sounds like a much easier path to take. Therefore, we choose cluelessness over vulnerability. Cluelessness keeps us feeling great about ourselves.

Why it's wrong: As imperfect human beings, we have vulnerability all wrong. We focus on the bad side of vulnerability and forget the good side of it: the invitation for connection, trust and friendship.

If we dare to be vulnerable enough to learn about our flaws and discuss them, that conversation itself makes you approachable. Vulnerability builds relationship and influence. It leads to you building a tribe of cheerleaders, coaches and family who will never allow you to be mediocre. People around you become themselves, speak truthfully, and the act itself destroys the conspiracy of mediocrity.

The Remedy To Mediocrity: Create A Culture Of Vulnerability And Feedback

We conspire every day to flame the fire of mediocrity and live in our own warm, little bubble. (Nice and cozy, isn’t it?) The truth, of course, is that opening up is the only way to build true, deep, lasting relationships that result in magnificence.

To choose mediocrity over vulnerability is weak. To accomplish things you can’t do on your own is courageous. To admit we need others to achieve something great is simply a fact.

Let’s just admit what is true, bust this conspiracy and overcome mediocrity.",None
"No matter how much you've achieved or how well your business is doing, everyone grapples with a little self-doubt now and then. Perhaps you're struggling to master a new skill or you just lost out on a big deal, and you're questioning whether you're really cut out for this.

It's normal to feel frustrated in when things aren't going as planned, but it's important to not let these obstacles detract from everything you've achieved. Here's how nine members of Young Entrepreneur Council overcome their feelings of self-doubt and get back on the road to confidence.

I turn to journal and positive inspiration readings. I read some of my previous journaling, write more and I read some positive quotes, articles, etc. I don’t let self-doubt consume me; instead, I tackle it head on and work hard to get on the other side of it. — Jess Moseley, TCS Interpreting

Finding the joy in your small business can be tough, especially when you feel all alone. I try to focus on a clear, creative project to help overcome self-doubt. It reminds me of what is important, and why I started this crazy journey! — Lizzy Jane Newsome Yopp, Kappa Toys

3. Remember That You're Not Alone

I remind myself that some of the most successful men and women in the world doubted themselves at one time or another. Doubt is a normal human reaction. It’s what we do with it that counts. — Dalia MacPhee, DALIA MACPHEE

4. Remind Yourself Of Your Good Intentions

When self-doubt creeps in, I remind myself that my intentions are good and that because of this fact, nothing I do can ever go ""wrong."" — Amanda Jacqueline, Higher Realms Consulting

A few simple words of encouragement from a friend or colleague can go a long way. I keep a file of complimentary hand-written notes and emails that I’ve received over the years. On a tough day, I find it helpful to turn to that file. Remembering the people I’ve helped over the years and the kind things they’ve said always leaves me feeling recharged. — Jackie Ducci, Ducci & Associates

6. Reflect On What You're Grateful For

When self-doubt creeps in, I stop, reset and clear my mind of any fear-based thoughts. I then set my intentions for just that day. I end the exercise with writing down 10 to 15 things I am grateful for. It is easy to get caught up in the small details and setbacks, but this is a reminder that the big picture is built from gratitude. — Hillary Hobson, Highest Cash Offer

7. Find The Root Cause Of Your Fear

Self-doubt forces me not to take things for granted and to double check assumptions. Breaking down and reflecting on the root cause(s) of the fear and assessing if that fear is rational and addressable has been helpful for me as well. — Pokin Yeung, Absolute Games

I keep a list of my accomplishments nearby and turn to them whenever I start to doubt myself. I also practice giving myself positive affirmations. It's a skill I learned later in life and practice daily with my son. — Amber Anderson, Tote + Pears

9. Determine An Action Step That Will Move You Forward

I ask myself questions like, “why am I doubting my abilities?” or “what can I do to fix this in order to be confident without doubting myself?” Once I determine why I am doubting myself, I will do more research, become more prepared, or do something that forces me out of my comfort zone. Once I am out of my comfort zone and accomplish something, typically the self-doubt leaves on its own. — Taylor Irwin, Rocky Mountain Car Wash",None
"A steady stream of news this year shows the decline of advertising agencies and an increase in job cuts -- even during a time of economic expansion. It’s estimated that more than 5,000 ad jobs were lost last year alone.

While I do not have a silver-bullet solution to assure agency success, I have learned a few things over the years. Throughout over 20 years in the industry and experience owning two agencies, these five lessons have made an impact on the success of my agency.

I started my first agency just before September 11, 2001. We immediately fell on hard economic times. Adding to the economic struggles, we went against other people’s recommendations and started our firm as a 50/50 partnership. I told myself we were going to be ""different"" and insisted that our partnership would succeed. My 20-something optimism got the best of me.

Needless to say, those well-meaning advisors were correct. The partnership didn’t work for a variety of reasons. Combining this poor business foundation with the effects of the economy following 9/11, we inevitably parted ways.

I’ve since learned that when people -- particularly other experienced business owners -- give you advice, it’s best to listen. They’re likely sharing their own lessons learned and that counts for something. That doesn’t mean every suggestion is worth implementing. You should, however, listen to what people have to say, objectively think it through, talk it over with your team leads or outside advisors, and see how it could benefit your agency.

My next lesson, remarkably, came from my 19-year-old son who posed the question: “Would you want to be business partners with yourself?”

There are countless lists, articles, books and recommendations on how to be a great business partner. But a good place to start is asking yourself the question my son asked me.

I learned that, in order to be a better business partner, I needed to become a better listener. Listening is key to showing respect and it forces you to be open to new ideas or other approaches. I realize the value of listening. But, I’ll be honest, listening is also hard for me. My mind is immediately triggered in new thoughts and directions. To combat this, I try to always have pen and paper on hand so I can jot down notes or thoughts and share those thoughts after, rather than interrupting.

As our agency has grown, I’ve learned that having unity -- particularly in company goals, vision and direction -- is paramount. When business partners are not unified, the focus and energy are stifled. Spend the time necessary to communicate, plan and gain that unification from the start.

Since starting VOLTAGE, I’ve wanted this agency to be a force for good. I wanted the agency to do good work, be good community members, and be good to our clients and co-workers. Over the years, this mantra has shaped our company culture and morphed into our mission. As part of this mission, our company now donates 4% of profits to the charitable causes that our clients choose and we routinely work together to do community service.

Some unexpected outcomes have emerged from being mission-driven. Our force for good mission has shaped our employee hiring and retention. We now seek employees who not only have the technical or creative skills required but who also connect with the company mission and who are eager to give back. Being part of a force for good has also given our team members an intrinsic value that is hard to replicate. And, because we donate time or money to the causes that our clients choose, we have been able to former stronger bonds that extend beyond the traditional agency-client bounds.

To determine your own company mission, start with a few questions:

Why does your company do what they do?

What keeps you and your team passionate about your work?

What does this mean for your clients?

What does this mean for your employees?

How does this affect your work?

All of these questions can help you to identify your passion. Once that is defined, determine how your passion can become your mission. Once these are clear, you can authentically begin incorporating it into your company DNA. One warning: Your employees and clients can sniff out a fake mission in a flash. Make sure your mission is authentic to the core of what your leadership and company really are.

I have outgrown my 20-something naivety and can admit that things don’t always go smoothly in business transactions. Whether it’s an inner-office struggle or a disagreement over client billing, I’ve learned that it’s always best to take the high road. It hurts to have to own up and admit a mistake, but that integrity matters. People will recognize when you are being honest and straightforward. In this business, you never know where the next opportunity might come from. Taking ownership for your mistakes often leads to future opportunities.

5. Learn to let go.

Being an agency owner means you work a lot. Many of us find ourselves at the crossroads of learning to let go or running yourself ragged.

That’s where good, smart hiring comes in. No employee is going to do something exactly how you would have, but that’s where the collaborative magic happens. Recognize your own weaknesses and hire people who have strengths in the areas you don’t so they can make meaningful contributions to your organization. Maybe give them some guidance or vision. Then, consciously let go and see what they have to offer. Give them the reins a bit and let them grow alongside your company.

Unfortunately, there is no secret sauce to ensuring your agency will succeed. Over time, you often learn lessons -- sometimes through a few painful experiences along the way. But when you keep trying, keep improving and keep producing quality work, both you and your agency will be better for it.",None
"Entitled employees complain -- a lot. Bad things are somebody else’s fault. They whine about the injustices of their organization. They create a groundswell that undermines the goodwill of others. They are experts at finding a soapbox and telling you everything that is going wrong in their world.

Of course, we encourage our people to have a point of view. But entitlement is a leadership derailer. Leaders are valued for having a voice and the ability to challenge the status quo. What entitled employees fail to recognize is that it's constructive advice that leads to improvement and progress.

When asked for recommendations on how to make improvements or lead change, entitled employees are hard pressed to be part of the solution. They instead point fingers. Those who are entitled can bring down entire teams by sabotaging good efforts.

The fundamental difference between our best employees and those who are entitled is they often fail to realize that they should be working on behalf of the greater good. Entitled employees somehow assume that they should be rewarded without truly earning that recognition through hard work, collaboration and humbleness.

A shared culture is about creating partnerships. These partnerships promote collective goals. We look to employees to come to work to solve challenges. This means expending positive energy toward finding solutions. Everybody has a stake in the ground and takes initiative.

Complaining is a self-absorbed and a passive exercise. It’s inward-facing and represents a lack of leadership maturity. It also becomes tedious and tiresome. Great employees who show leadership own problems. That means they take accountability to drive change.

Entitled employees do see challenges, but instead are quick to find fault and lay blame. They see liabilities in everything.

It's critical for entitled behavior to be addressed. But what is an organization to do?

First off, here’s the good news: The danger signs are right there in bold, staring you in the face.

Entitled employees are not part of a secret underground club. They are noisy, obvious and stand out. If you manage any of these types of leaders, you know who they are, as they believe that an organization has in some way wronged them. They display a sense of righteous injustice.

I'll give you an example. One of my clients indicated that the transformation project she was leading was not getting any traction from her peers. She was new to the company, just six months in. When I probed as to why she thought this might be the case, she replied with, ""I'm not sure, I have been highly successful in the past and I know what I am doing.""

I suggested to this client that although she had been successful in the past, she was a new and unproven quantity in her current organization. In other words, respect and credibility had to be earned. She would have to work hard at understanding her stakeholder's unique business challenges and what mattered to them. Then she could carve out recommendations that fit their needs.

This approach would better earn the necessary respect. This would allow them to be heard and understood rather than being offered what was perceived as a predetermined proposal. In essence, understanding her audience and building rapport is never to be assumed.

So now you know the signs. If you recognize any of these traits in your employees, take swift action. Speak to them about their behaviors. Great leaders provide entitled employees with very direct and transparent feedback. Tell them outright that they shouldn't externalize or place blame when projects go off the rails or hit roadblocks. Instead, they are expected to brainstorm with their peers in constructive ways that allow for improvements and positive change.

If those entitled do aspire to bigger roles, then the definition of great leadership is to take ownership. This means proactively spearheading an initiative. Entitled employees need to transition by displaying positive energy that is characterized by creative and innovative suggestions. Leaders who are impactful create change through others.

If after feedback and outlining your expectations you don’t see behavioral change, you, as a leader, must make a hard decision. Entitled employees can be a toxic, viral force. We spend most of our waking hours with our work colleagues, therefore every employee deserves to be part of an environment that stimulates ideas and fosters the building blocks of greatness.",None
"It’s fine to get up each day, write in your journal, look at your vision board, say your affirmations, recite some mantras, overcome your limiting beliefs and ask the universe for everything you want. It’s not fine to then sit there and scroll Facebook and wonder why it’s not happening. Why is the money tree not bearing fruits? Because fruits require labour.

If you are asking the universe but turning up late to meetings, you won’t get where you want to get. If you are dying to create passive income but can’t convert new clients for your startup, something is going wrong. If you’re chilling out in the sun but haven’t got any bookings, you’re not self-employed, you’re unemployed. Try swapping the affirmations for networking. Try swapping the visualisation for making calls. Use those mindset exercises as a supplement to your considered actions, not a replacement.

In world champion marathon runner Paula Radcliffe’s book, How to Run, she explains how she conditions her mind to win a race. One of the mental exercises Radcliffe follows is to visualise the finish line, to imagine her friends and family are there supporting her and picture the looks on their faces as they watch her win. She pictures the race time she wants to achieve on the clock displayed above her. She thinks about this before a race and throughout too, if she needs extra motivation.

Alongside the visualisation in Radcliffe’s book are detailed training and diet plans, along with guidance on how to schedule your mileage before running your first marathon. Paula Radcliffe could, perhaps, have won all those races without the visualisation. But there’s no way she could have won them without the training. The two complimented each other to make her the fastest female marathoner of all time. One of the main criticisms of the book is that to follow her marathon training programmes, you’d have to be a full-time runner. Of course, Radcliffe was a full time runner, reportedly running over 145 miles per week!

It’s undeniable that visualisation can be a powerful tool. In an experiment conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of visualisation in how basketball players converted free throws, the psychologist split 120 of them into four separate groups. The first group practised. The second group visualised themselves making free throws, but didn’t practice. The third group undertook a combination of physical and mental practice, and the fourth group didn’t do anything. The result? Groups one and three improved, group three by a greater proportion. Group two made no significant improvement.

In this example, and plenty more from the world of business, the practice itself was the foundation and the mental exercises were the edge. Visualisation on its own didn’t work. In the real world, it should never be seen as a quick shortcut for missing practice or just putting the miles in. Visualisation should help with two things: motivation and attitude. Getting good, mastering your craft and executing your plan, that’s something else.

This year I have interviewed eleven entrepreneurs, business leaders and creatives about the childhood influences that shaped their future success. The thread that ran, without fail, through each of their stories is the impact of solid, hard work. Many of them watched their parents getting up early, putting the hours in, striving to achieve success, and they emulated this to develop their own work ethic.

Among these eleven, Craig Donaldson, the CEO of Metro Bank, grew up in a pub and watched his parents share kitchen and front of house duties for 15 hours a day. He learned very early on that if customers weren’t happy with the food, drink or service, they simply wouldn’t return. This kind of attitude towards work meant that Donaldson, like many other successful entrepreneurs and business people, are unashamed of just working hard.

Surround yourself with positive people, yes. Set your goals and visualise achieving them, yes. Have mantras you say to yourself when you need encouragement, of course. But no amount of affirmations will substitute working out a plan and giving it everything you’ve got.

Remember, a plane doesn’t take off because it has mentally revved itself up so it feels ready to perform. It doesn’t lie dormant until it has motivated itself to start the engine. It takes off and reaches its destination because it’s designed to do so. All the parts are present and working: the engine, the wings, the pilot and crew. Planes take off because of design, not desire.

There is no magic potion. There is no money tree. Nothing happens suddenly. The way to really succeed? Get 90% of your motivation purely from the fact that you’re doing something you believe in, even when it’s tough. Put your heart and soul into it. Keep learning, stay enthusiastic, do the right thing. Keep going.

You can’t have the highs without the lows, and you absolutely cannot have the money, the freedom, the lifestyle, the accolades, the network and the opportunities without the hours of effort, sacrifice, perseverance and faith in the years leading up to that point. If anyone tries to sell you shortcuts, be very sceptical. If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is. If someone is selling a course promising that you can be a millionaire, consider that they’ll sell more courses if they make it sound easy. It’s not easy. Don’t be fooled. Define where ‘there’ is. If you’re not there yet, keep working.

Visualisation and hard work are the perfect pairing, but the former is not a substitute for the latter.",None
"For many of us, it's all about what we do, where we work--our accomplishments and talents. You have a distinct personality, but often that can be lost or jumbled together with your job or the role assigned to you. However, in 2019, it's more important than ever that you define your personal brand as more than just a title or a job function.

Defining who you are is the most important differentiator you can make, and you have to avoid the trap of matching a job description. You have to work hard to make sure you are not pigeonholed by a boss simply because that helps the company the most or makes you part of an overall team. Sadly, letting someone else define you is going to become a recipe for disaster because it also makes you interchangeable and dispensable.

What works much better is for you to be the one who defines your personal brand, not anyone else. And a personal brand is about more than just a list of talents or unique attributes. It's about more than developing a few skills and creating a nice resume.

At the start of 2019, think about what defines you as a person, and don't limit yourself to a job description or a job function. Are you a people person? Analytical? Brilliant and insightful? A math whiz? OK, now broaden out and become more than that.

The concept of personal brand has been around a while, but from what I've seen, many people don't really define themselves holistically. They see themselves as a salesperson, or a writer, or a social media guru, or an accountant. Big mistake. In the current job market, where multiple skills and talents take you further than a deep dive (or you might say rabbit trail) into one specific area, you have to stay open-minded.

Here's what I mean by that. In my role mentoring college students, the ones who have the best chances of finding an amazing career someday are those who define themselves as multitalented, multiskilled, and open to any challenge. They stand out not because they are generalists who can do a few things with some proficiency but because they avoid being pigeonholed and can take on just about any task. They are really good at many things. They are highly employable, and they will have long, successful careers.

What separates them the most is that they have a rich, fully realized concept of their own identity and their own talents. By the way, this is the opposite of what it takes to build a successful company or brand. In marketing, you want to focus on the differentiators and the highly compelling attributes of a product. That's because customers choose specifics. But employers, more and more, will be looking for the multitalented.

With a personal brand, you want to differentiate yourself by being absolutely amazing at everything. I like to tell young writers that the best way to have a successful writing career is to be perfect at everything--billing, relationships, grammar, insight, product research, social media. No pressure, right? I believe this applies to the workplace and to every person--become a genius at everything. Read six or eight books at a time. Explore a variety of fields and genres. Push yourself to grow as a person in all areas.

Some ""career coaches"" will tell you to specialize. I believe this is woefully misguided advice. When you are so specific, you will probably find a good job and will stay with that job a long time, but you won't really advance too far. Your personal brand will be stunted, you won't grow, and you won't explore new ideas. You'll also get really bored.

I wrote about this topic of career diversification not long ago, and within a day or two about 100 people wrote in to say they were stuck and bored. My advice to them at the time and my advice to you: Get out of the box. Redefine yourself in 2019 as someone who is open to exploring any new area, who can take on any task, and can excel at just about anything.",None
"One of the benefits of using Facebook Ads is the ability to have ads shown on other websites and apps besides Facebook itself. This includes serving ads to users on WhatsApp. Marketers who are looking for new ways to connect to their target audience in 2019 should consider using Facebook's new WhatsApp ad targeting options.

WhatsApp is one of the most popular mobile apps on the planet. According to the company, more than 1 billion people in over 180 countries use WhatsApp. It's estimated that there are more than 450 million messages are sent each day on the platform. With such a diverse range of people using the platform often, WhatsApp is an ideal place to target specific audiences.

Back in August of 2018, Facebook announced that it would roll out new WhatsApp ads in 2019, but no specific launch date was given. Recent reports have suggested that ""Facebook has added traffic, conversions and page post engagement objectives for its Click-to-WhatsApp ads, ads that launch a WhatsApp chat, via the Facebook News Feed.""

At first, marketers could only use WhatsApp in Facebook ads where users can click the ad to send a message on WhatsApp to the advertiser. This is great for lead generation, but it left WhatsApp unable to be used in some of the more common Facebook ads. By including traffic, website conversions, and post engagement ads, marketers can use WhatsApp for the same kinds of campaigns they run on Facebook and Instagram.

Adding these new ad options for WhatsApp can help Facebook and Facebook advertisers in other ways. As the number of people who use Facebook Ads increases, so does the amount of competition for limited advertising space. Facebook can only serve so many ads via News Feeds before users complain about ad saturation. Greater competition for ad space increases the price of ads, which could make business owners less likely to use Facebook Ads.

One of the biggest benefits to using ads on Facebook is that they are less expensive than Google Ads. If that ceases to be the case, some marketers are going to move their budgets to other advertising platform. By using WhatsApp to serve the same kinds of ads it would show on Facebook News Feeds, Facebook has tremendously increase the amount of advertising space it has to work with. This will keep the prices lower for everyone using Facebook Ads.

Advertisers running Click-to-WhatsApp ads receive metric reports through the Facebook Ads Manager dashboard that track how many conversations were started by the ads. This data can be used to determine how well WhatsApp ad placement is performing compared to the traditional Facebook Ad placements.

In order to use the newest WhatsApp ad options on Facebook, advertisers must have WhatsApp Business app downloaded and attached to their Facebook Page, similar to the way that an Instagram account can be linked to a Facebook Ads account. With an official business profile, brands using WhatsApp ""can interact with customers easily by using tools to automate, sort, and quickly respond to messages"".

By using WhatsApp, businesses can communicate with customers on a platform that some people prefer to use the most. There are millions of messages and billions of phone calls made on WhatsApp each day. By making it easier for people on WhatsApp to communicate with brands, business owners can have an advantage over companies that aren't engaging with customers on their platform of choice. Being an early adopter of WhatsApp marketing can help a business reach customers the competition isn't really targeting yet.",None
"Although there's some evidence that suggests women are more likely to be overthinkers than men (which is why I included an entire chapter about it my latest book, 13 Things Mentally Strong Women Don't Do), the truth is, everyone overthinks sometimes.

Overthinking is a common issue I address in my therapy office. People often come to their appointments saying things like, ""I can't relax. It's like my brain won't shut off,"" or ""I can't stop thinking about how my life could have been better if I'd done things differently.""

It's likely that overthinking causes mental health to decline and as your mental health declines, the more likely you are to overthink. It's a vicious downward spiral.

But, it's hard to recognize that spiral when you're caught in the middle of it. In fact, your brain might try to convince you that worrying and ruminating is somehow helpful.

After all, won't you develop a better solution or prevent yourself from making the same mistake if you spend more time thinking? Not necessarily.

In fact, the opposite is often true. Analysis paralysis is a real problem. The more you think, the worse you feel. And your feelings of misery, anxiety, or anger may cloud your judgment and prevent you from taking positive action.

Overthinking is also different than self-reflection. Healthy self-reflection is about learning something about yourself or gaining a new perspective about a situation. It's purposeful.

Overthinking involves dwelling on how bad you feel and thinking about all the things you have no control over. It won't help you develop new insight.

The difference between problem-solving, self-reflection, and overthinking isn't about the amount of time you spend in deep thought. Time spent developing creative solutions or learning from your behavior is productive. But time spent overthinking, whether it's 10 minutes or 10 hours, won't enhance your life.

When you become more aware of your tendency to overthink things, you can take steps to change. But first, you have to recognize that overthinking does more harm than good.

Sometimes, people think that their overthinking somehow prevents bad things from happening. And they think if they don't worry enough or rehash the past enough then somehow, they'll encounter more problems. But, the research is pretty clear--overthinking is bad for you and it does nothing to prevent or solve problems.

"One of the most comprehensive--if not the most comprehensive--strategies to improve Millennial (and Generation Z) recruitment, engagement, and retention is with improved learning and development.

The research on the impact of L&D is clear and it has become clearer to me throughout my eight years of studying how to attract, engage, and lead the emerging generations.

The entrance of Generation Z into the workplace and Millennials stepping into leadership positions are quickly exposing how irrelevant, antiquated, and inefficient many organization's training is.

Considering only 29 percent of Generation Z believe they have the skills and knowledge to thrive in the workplace, the importance of learning and development will accelerate.

The New Challenges of Training



Organizations are falling behind fast in their ability to offer learning and development programs that prepare and engage Generation Z workers and transform Millennials into organizational leaders.

The stakes of bad training have never been higher than they are today. Long, antiquated, and non-transformative training harms the recruitment, engagement, and retention of Millennial and Generation Z employees.

Training Millennials and Generation Z can be challenging but the payoff is worth it.

The #1 factor emerging generations consider when starting a new job is sufficient training. (It's also the top factor for evaluating whether or not they made the right employer choice.)

Eighty percent of the emerging generations say an emphasis on personal growth is the most important quality of a company's culture. And employees are 3.5x more likely to be engaged at work when given meaningful weekly feedback.

Seventy-one percent of the emerging generations who are likely to leave an organization within 2 years are dissatisfied with how their leadership skills are being developed.

Sixty-six percent of organizations that view L&D as critical to success had a stronger market position than their competitors.

Sixty-two percent of Generation Z want to learn in order to improve at their jobs.

Sixty-nine percent of Millennials aspire to be leaders in the next five years and 60 percent of Millennials want training to develop their leadership skills.

"Ever wonder why there's so much conflict in your workplace, which stifles productivity and slows down growth? Often, it's because of personality types clashing and different working styles at play.

For example, some people in your accounting or finance department may be notorious for holding up an approval process once it reaches their desk. Or a sales rep has a hard time following through on things, which affects customers.

To get that team-collaboration vibe that's virtually drama-free and running on all cylinders, it's important to understand each other's style of working and communicating, as well as your own.

In the best of teams, you'll find diversity in personalities and modes of expression. Team members have certain inherent traits to match the particular activities and tasks of the job, which accelerates performance, creativity, and innovation. Everybody plays a role and the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.

But first, leaders must find the right people with the right typologies in order to create these super teams. Based on most studies, I've found that there are four dominant personality types that will make up a diverse team that communicates for high performance and produces results.

Using the guide below, as you look over the strengths of each team member and build out your teams, make sure you have these four types prevalent for optimum collaboration.

Every team needs a member with the natural tendencies to push for results, see the big picture, and focus on the bottom line. Quite often, these are your high level leaders. They are driven communicators who always follow through to get the job done. Their propensity for ""winning"" and high need for achievement comes through strong due to their self-confidence, motivation, and competitive nature. While they may frequently clash with others and step-on-toes, they are key to a team's success because they don't fear failure.

Of the four types covered here, a team member exhibiting this personality type is the best communicator with the highest degree of emotional intelligence, and having him or her on your team is critical to success. He or she is is self-aware and can relate to all other three styles much easier. He or she is an excellent facilitator, and are wired to nurture and develop other people due to their natural relationship-building tendencies. As you think about identifying potential managers to develop teams, you want to include these social communicators on your team.

These personality types do not like to be tied down by convention. They are experiential, adventurous, and out-of-the-box thinkers. They set and achieve ambitious goals, and they do not like to be told ""You can't."" They bring a sense of flair, looking at old situations and problems in new ways that others may not see. They rise to the occasion in times of crisis and become creative problem solvers. They add extreme value when teams are running out of ideas and solutions.

They are really the pillars that hold the building together, and a force to be reckoned with.They are extremely hard working, organized, structured, dependable, reliable, and take a no-nonsense approach to work relationships. Their major strengths are a strong personal commitment to their work, being precise, punctual, and seeing that others do the same to get the job done right. Their perseverance to get the job done or overcoming a challenge is extraordinary. They take responsibility very seriously, and it shows through in how they express themselves.

Something to think about

As you better understand the personality and communication styles of those around you (including yourself), you can leverage the strengths of each member to work and communicate better so your business grows.",None
"Last month I did a piece for Psychology Today, Why Mindfulness Is an Underrated Management Attribute, discussing why a ""mindful"" approach (considering that employee engagement nationally is routinely only around 30%) can be a positive thing.

I frankly admitted I wasn't an expert in mindfulness and wasn't even exactly sure how to define it, but I'd long intuitively felt that it involved qualities like self-awareness, patience and empathy... and however we defined it, we needed more of it in management.

Then a couple days ago I received a comment on Psychology Today about my article from a psychologist, Donald D. Matthews. ""Mr. Lipman provides a thoughtful overview of mindfulness from a management perspective,"" he wrote. ""But one important point that should not be overlooked is that mindfulness is a practice that helps us become more present so that when we engage with others we have a calm clarity to understand their needs better. Mindfulness teaches us to demonstrate self compassion and regulate our emotions. As Mr. Lipman points out, self awareness, patience and empathy are all traits that can be cultivated through mindfulness. Managers who can demonstrate these qualities in their interpersonal interactions are likely to be much more compassionate and effective managers.""

Ah, now that's what was I was trying to say. But Dr. Matthews said it better than I.

In fact, I like the last sentence so much I think it's worth repeating with emphasis:

Managers who can demonstrate these qualities in their interpersonal interactions are likely to be much more compassionate and effective managers.

The reality is a fair number of managers are chosen more for hard skills than soft ones and aren't too comfortable communicating with their employees. Some hardly talk to them at all.

Which is partly why some 70% of employees are disengaged (note Gallup engagement stat above), or not emotionally committed to their organizations. Given such data, it's safe to infer more than a few employee needs are not being met.

Which is why learning how to, and taking the time to, engage with others ""with a calm clarity to understand their needs better"" is a good thing for management. A very good thing.",wellness
"The Boy Scouts of America (BSA) is known for teaching kids about survival skills – but now the storied organization needs some survival advice itself.

In the midst of ongoing litigation tied to sexual abuse allegations – along with shrinking membership, not unrelated – BSA could face a balance sheet problem. As such, the Dallas-based non-profit has engaged turnaround consultants at Alvarez & Marsal to help address operational and financial pressures, two sources familiar with the matter told Debtwire.

BSA has also enlisted legal counsel Sidley Austin for help exploring a potential bankruptcy filing, The Wall Street Journal reported. A Chapter 11 filing could help BSA negotiate payouts to victims, a strategy adopted by organizations such as USA Gymnastics and over 20 Catholic dioceses grappling with sexual-abuse claims.

BSA has been mired in lawsuits brought by former members alleging inappropriate conduct by its employees or volunteers dating back to the 1960s, its annual filings show. The organization is “aware of threatened and expanding litigation of a similar nature,” which includes claims for compensatory damages and/or punitive damages, according to its 2017 annual report.

States including New York and Pennsylvania are considering lifting or extending the statute of limitations for abuse victims.

To address such claims, BSA could set up a litigation trust composed of contributions from insurance carriers as well as its own cash on hand, one of the sources said.

The organization ended FY17 with $191.9 million of insurance reserves, which management deemed sufficient to resolve those lawsuits, according to its latest filing. While it had $45.2 million of cash, $14.7 million was restricted for property expansion at the Summit Bechtel Reserve, a training and Scouting center.

BSA’s debt load has ballooned in recent years to help fund the Summit’s development. In 2012, the organization issued $175 million in bonds due 2022, and increased its revolving line of credit by $25 million.

As of 31 December, BSA had $42.9 million 3.22% fixed senior bonds due 2020, $155.5 million 2.94% fixed bonds due 2022, and a $22.5 million Libor+100bps term loan due 2022.

It also had drawn $26 million on its $75 million revolver due 2020.

The organization’s financial state could be in peril should its insurance reserves not adequately resolve the litigation claims, the sources noted. In addition, BSA’s efforts to be more inclusive— by dropping the ‘Boy’ in its main program and welcoming girls and transgender scouts to join— has not resulted in a membership spike.

Meanwhile, The Girl Scouts of the United States of America filed a trademark infringement lawsuit against BSA in November 2018, claiming that the change is confusing for parents.

BSA has roughly 2.3 million youth members across its 266 local councils, down from 2.9 million in 2006, filings show. At its peak, the organization reportedly had 4.8 million members in the 1970s.

BSA spokesperson Effie Delimarkos issued the following statement to Debtwire: “The Boy Scouts of America is working with experts and exploring all options available to ensure that local and national programming continues uninterrupted, while also living up to our social and moral responsibility to fairly compensate victims who suffered abuse during their time in Scouting. No decisions have been made and we continue to fully meet our financial obligations to our vendors, creditors and other stakeholders. It is due diligence for an organization to consider all of our opportunities and pathways forward.”

What do the individuals you lead aspire to create, for themselves, their families and your organization? We all have aspirational goals. Even if an employee always wants to find the path of least resistance, on some level that's an aspiration for simplicity and efficiency. Aspirational awareness is an important part of emotional intelligence - and the key to driving new results. Acknowledge, Acknowledge, Acknowledge: Three valuable words in a new leaders vocabulary, and they must be said (and demonstrated) if you are going to create real leadership impact: ""I see you."" Take every opportunity to catch someone doing something right, and acknowledge the behavior you wish to see more of. And remember, ""I see you"" is a close cousin of ""I'm watching you"" - just in case a team member thinks she can get away with a less than stellar effort. How do you use acknowledgement and observation to drive the behaviors you want, and drive out the behaviors you don't? Remember The Fifth P: The marketing mix features four famous ""P's"": product, price, promotion and place. The leadership mix focuses on the fifth ""p"": personalization. How well do you understand the personal puts and takes of the team you manage? Motivation on a personal level is what matters here. Can you identify what each person on your team really cares about, and phrase your outcomes in terms that speak their language? Access Your Super Power: Consider that we all have the ability to anticipate. Without it, no one could turn left out of a parking lot. As a leader, what do you anticipate for your team? Identifying obstacles and empowering team members to find solutions is what a leader does. What does your team anticipate - what obstacles do they see, that you don't? After all, anticipation isn't just your superpower - we all have the ability to be heroes (if we choose to do so). Ask for insights and learn from the experts on your team! It'll help you to anticipate what's next.

Communication is the key to bringing your vision to life, and to providing the leadership support your team really needs. For leaders today, it's helpful to remember these words from Sunday in the Park with George:

A vision's just a vision

 If it's only in your head

 If no one gets to see it,

 It's as good as dead.

Don't let your team keep guessing about what you need, and what you expect, if you're really preparing for success. Your vision deserves to be shared - with leadership skills that your entire team can understand.",None
"Unless you're under the age of 35 or a fan of electronic dance music, you may have never heard of the Swedish musician, super DJ, and music producer, Avicii, although you likely heard his most popular song, ""Wake Me Up,"" playing at one point or another.

Avicii, whose real name was Tim Bergling, reached almost absurd levels of fame, success, wealth and adoration.  Sadly, his success came a heavy cost of anxiety, depression, heavy alcoholism, and ultimately suicide.  He was only 28 when he died from self-inflicted wounds from broken glass on April 20, 2018.

The Grammy-nominated artist enjoyed great financial success, regularly earning tens of millions of dollars per year and landing on many of Forbes highest earning lists, especially during his peak from 2014 through 2016.  Celebrity Net Worth reported his net worth when he died to be around $50 million.  His Hollywood Hills mansion sold for $17.5 million earlier this year.  He signed lucrative endorsement deals with Volvo and Ralph Lauren.

Yet Avicii was never motivated by money.  He said during an interview in 2013, ""I discovered when I started making money that I didn't really need it.""  Instead, he turned towards charitable goals, saying,  ""When you have such an excess of money you don't need, the most sensible, most human and completely obvious thing is to give to people in need.""

These weren't just words to the famous DJ.  In 2012, he embarked on a tour called ""House for Hunger"" and donated all of his income from the tour to the charity, Feeding America, to combat hunger.  He added another $1 million afterwards, along with an additional one million euros to a Swedish ""hunger aid"" charity a year later.  And these were just some of the publicly-reported gifts.

Given his wealth and how charitably-inclined Avicii was, it is surprising that he died without a will.  Despite his young age of 28, Avicii could have followed suit of many other celebrity estate plans and used an estate plan to benefit charitable causes, like Mark Zuckerberg, Hugh Hefner, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and Leona Helmsley.  Instead, under the probate laws of Sweden, his parents inherit all of his wealth.  Avicii was not married and had no children.

Is this want Avicii would have wanted?  Perhaps.  But given his charitable track record, it's likely he would have preferred at least some of his fortune to combat hunger or advance other worthy causes.  He also had two brothers and a sister that he may have wanted to provide for.

By not making out even a simple will before he died, his wishes for what happens with his fortune no longer matter, legally.  Rather, his assets pass to his parents.  The intestate laws of Sweden do not include siblings (because his parents are alive) or charities, even though Avicii may have wanted to include them.

What about taxes?  Because Sweden does not have an estate or inheritance tax, Avicii's parents will not have to pay a large tax bill, unlike if Avicii had been a United States citizen.  But because he lived in California, his U.S. assets - including the Hollywood Hills home - may be subject to estate taxes.  Any such taxes could have been minimized by good estate planning, especially considering Avicii's charitable nature.

And therein lies the lesson.  It doesn't matter that Avicii was only 28 years old.  No one is promised tomorrow.  It's not only ""old"" people that die.  Anyone with assets should take the time to plan for what happens if they should die.

Estate planning often starts with a basic will, and for most twenty-somethings, that should be enough.  People with greater wealth - even a small fraction of what Avicii earned - should work with an experienced estate planning attorney and create a revocable living trust, or use other more sophisticated planning measures.

Whether you want to leave money to charity, your parents, or anyone else, don't want until ""someday"" to make out a will.  Learn a lesson from Avicii's mistake.",None
"There’s never enough time in the day for a business entrepreneur. Repetitive daily tasks can eat up an inordinate amount of time that could be better spent elsewhere. To maximize productivity, it helps to stay up to date on current technologies that can save time and help manage the various “to-dos” that can quickly eat up the day.

There’s an almost staggering array of business and productivity software, apps and add-ons available. With so many options to choose from, it can be difficult to know which tech truly stands out from the rest. Below, 16 members of Young Entrepreneur Council share their current favorite tech hacks for saving time and managing daily work.

Our team has recently switched from using TextExpander to Saved Replies in Help Scout for managing our customer support. These saved replies are saving us tons of time while also creating happier customers with the faster response time. The saved replies are immensely more helpful than TextExpander. Our team no longer needs to memorize specific labels or go back and forth between the help desk and TextExpander to search for the reply. The fully integrated saved replies are easy to create, find and use. These have allowed our small team to scale further and free up more time for all of the million other tasks that need doing. - Stephanie Wells, Formidable Forms

I use the G Suite extension called Sortd, which has a lot of great features that can help you better organize your time. For example, when I open my mailbox first thing in the morning, it greets me with a popup saying: “What’s your focus for today?” I then enter my goals for the day one by one. When I finish a task, I click the checkboxes and it moves it down to the completed items. It’s very satisfying to click those checkboxes! The extension also allows you to better classify your emails. For example, when an email needs a follow-up, I send it to the “FollowUp” category, and the extension “stickies” it on the right side of my screen in a sidebar that includes all items I need to follow up with. This extension is a lifesaver for those who get over 100 emails per day like I do. - Amine Rahal, Little Dragon Media

I’ve recently adopted the Pomodoro method when working in order to keep myself productive without feeling rushed or anxious. This is accomplished with the aid of a Pomodoro timer that you reset after every session. I like to use a physical Pomodoro timer when working from my home office, but I use an app on my smartphone when working in my main office. This is the best method I’ve found for accomplishing a large number of tasks without feeling burned out in the middle of the day — giving myself micro-breaks and dividing every task into smaller chunks of work. For some reason, 24 Pomodoro cycles are so much easier to manage than eight full hours of work, despite being equal amounts of time. -Bryce Welker, Accounting Institute for Success

My favorite tech hack for saving time and managing daily work is an automation system called Control4. Specifically, the system integrates and automates all the little (but crucial) maintenance issues that make a business run smoothly. For example, I can set and control the settings of my business’ lighting, temperature, televisions, security systems and much more with the touch of the button, even when I’m not in the office. Control4 gives me a competitive edge by streamlining my business’ operating systems and saving me precious time. As a business owner, I have enough to worry about without letting minor technological maintenance issues distract me.  - Shu Saito, Godai Soaps

If you have Gmail and don’t have Mixmax, you’re losing out on a lot of automation. It’s great for tracking who reads your messages and automating reminders to bug someone if they don’t respond. I really enjoy being able to track who reads my messages; it gives me a much better insight into an email and how many times someone read it before they responded. In a business environment, that is invaluable to me. The software has a ton of other features, but the most valuable to me is the ability to see when and where someone read my email. - James Guldan, Vision Tech Team

My favorite tech hack today is utilizing a Trello board to portion out the tasks, projects and ideas that I have on my plate. As an entrepreneur and marketer, new work pops up every day, and you need a way to properly record it so that you can return to it later or mark it as a priority for your time. With my Trello account, I have different buckets for high-priority work, ideas and in-progress work. I even break the tasks down into the different departments of my business (that is, social media, content creation, advertising, software and so on) so that I can easily see what I have going on within each area of the business. You can download Trello directly to your phone as well so that you have it for organizing thoughts on the go. It gives me a reliable way to remember everything. - Connor Gillivan, FreeeUp

Asana is a great tool to organize, manage and track our entire company’s workflow. It’s a great time-saving tech hack, especially for remote companies. You can go in and see what each team is working on and if they’re on track or behind. You can assign tasks to yourself or others with due dates to make sure projects are completed on time and even “tag” followers on a task that you want to keep updated. The ability to immediately see, at a glance, what your tasks are, as well as get a notification each time a team member finishes their own task, is important to keeping everyone in the company on the same page. - John Turner, SeedProd LLC

Time Doctor is pretty great because it allows you to easily time-block your day. The app will let you know if you are visiting a distracting site, and if you’ve been idle for too long, will ask you if you’re still working. Being honest with yourself and the app helps keep you on track. You’re then able to dive deep into the data and find out how you allocate your time. This helps when figuring out what to delegate or what you need to spend more time on. - Syed Balkhi, WPBeginner

Maintaining an active social media presence is important, but it can take up a lot of time in the day. That’s why Buffer is a great tool. With Buffer, instead of logging into all of your social media accounts over and over again throughout the day, you can go in and schedule all of your social media posts for the entire week for all of your platforms in one place. You can easily share and re-share all of your content and schedule it to post at peak times when it will get the most engagement. - Blair Williams, MemberPress

CoSchedule is a tool we’re loving for social media and content scheduling. Both of these are huge drivers for our market strategy, but taking time out of our day to schedule posts is irritating and time-consuming. Sometimes we even forget! Now it’s so much easier to select content for the week and schedule it all out a week in advance. This saves us sitting around trying to think up useful content, and we can focus on more pressing tasks at hand. CoSchedule also sends a weekly follow-up that tells you how your marketing went and even how much time you saved that week by using various features of CoSchedule. Analytics are easy to read and understand too, which helps us tweak our strategy. - Brandon Stapper, Nonstop Signs

Boomerang is the most important extension I have on my email.  I not only use it to suggest times for meetings and calls that auto-populate into Google calendar, but also to bring a message back to my inbox if there’s been no reply after a certain amount of days. This is a huge time saver over having a list of everyone that I need to follow up with. I can also schedule an email to send at a later time if I don’t want it to go out immediately. - David Ehrenberg, Early Growth Financial Services

Not quite a tech hack but a collaborative task-management tool, Any.do works equally well with Chrome, Android and iOS. While the basic version is free to use, the paid version comes with a range of additional features. These include setting up recurring tasks, attaching notes and making use of location-based reminders. The free version of the app lets you preview all the tasks you have lined up for the day, giving you the option to commit or reschedule. You may view your to-dos based on different categories such as work, personal and goals. The Any.do Moment works as a recurring reminder, which you may schedule for any time. The mobile app includes a type-head function that lets you add new tasks quickly by using voice. - Derek Robinson, Top Notch Dezigns

Wunderlist is a rather simple but very useful app that works great for both personal and professional tasks. It’s easy to share to-do lists, reminders and notes with anyone on any device. What I like about it is that you can quickly send simple messages, such as including someone on a project, wherever that person happens to be and whether he or she is using an iPhone, Android or laptop. I also find that it’s good for reminding myself of something, whether it’s an upcoming meeting or to wish someone happy birthday. It’s often small details that make the difference when it comes to productivity, and Wunderlist is helpful to keep the gears running smoothly. - Kalin Kassabov, ProTexting

Much of my time is spent traveling to conferences worldwide and meeting with clients face-to-face. Keeping track of all my commitments used to be a hassle.  Calendly integrates seamlessly with Outlook (and every other major calendar service, such as Google) to keep my schedule straight and keep me accessible to clients. When I’m traveling, I even encourage team members to make use of Calendly to book time with me where they can have my undivided attention. - Thomas Smale, FE International

Rocketbook is an erasable notebook that can automatically upload your notes to the cloud. It looks and feels like any other paper notebook. Plus, you can use any erasable pen from Pilot, which can be found at most office supply stores. Simply take a photo of the page with your phone to automatically upload the content to the cloud system of your choosing. Afterwards, use a damp cloth to erase the writing on the page. The ink comes off easily and there is no trace of the previous writing on the page. - Matthew Podolsky, Florida Law Advisers, P.A.

As the owner of a completely remote company, my daily work is never the same, and I really need to focus my time and energy on projects that will move the needle and not get caught up in busy work. The Focus app is great in helping me achieve this by allowing me to block out certain time-wasting and distracting websites. I can also schedule breaks depending on when I need it. The app will block certain websites of my choice and replace them with a motivational quote, which is awesome! It allows me to stay on track and get the work that’s needed to finish open-ended projects done. It helps improve productivity and blocks distractions, which saves me time and money! - Dave Nevogt, Hubstaff.com",None
"The secret to faster business growth starts with your business development team. But are members of your business development team evaluating potential partners accurately? Are they taking a truly long-term view of your business and its place within the industry? Below are seven business development techniques I find effective for faster business growth as a director of strategic accounts.

1. Use the 80/20 rule to your benefit.

According to the 80/20 rule, the top 20% of all deals you sign will account for 80% of the growth of your business. Understanding that one simple rule can do wonders for your business development team and help them hit it out of the park every single time. You can’t go after every potential business partner, so you have to focus on the ones that matter. If you’re a technology consulting company, for example, then your biz dev team can spend about 80% of its time going after the 20% of partners that really matter for your company’s tech ecosystem.

In the era of social media, it’s easier than ever to find and connect with the top decision makers. If you don’t know who has the ultimate decision making authority at a company or organization, head over to LinkedIn and make sure you understand which individuals your biz dev team should be talking to. Connecting with key decision-makers through social media may be easier than making a series of unreturned phone calls. LinkedIn's traditional search capability, which includes a number of filters, works great for me in this regard. Their products for sales and recruitment can work wonders as well. Groups are great, too, since you can find relevant folks engaging in conversations and linking posts. This is also a good way to come across key decision makers.

In some industries, it can be easy to lose sight of the fact that every new deal is a relationship and not a transaction. Nobody feels like being treated as “just another logo” that can be featured on your website as a partner. The best tip I have is to provide value to the partner by giving something that's going to add value to the other person without expectations. Another way is to socialize with them -- again, not just for business. In business, as in life, relationships matter. If you’re a software product engineering company, for example, you want to make sure you are partnering with other companies that are aligned with your overall business objectives and that reflect your view of the tech industry.

4. Once you sign a deal, don’t forget about the deal.

This might sound obvious, but you’d be surprised at how many technology consulting companies in particular ignore this simple rule. They are so excited to sign up a new partner that they fail to realize that signing a new deal is just the beginning. I've found that you also have to think about following up, keeping your side of the deal and making sure that you hit all key deadlines and milestones. In other words, you have to be a great partner.

5. Emphasize the repeat sale and the repeat customer.

Business development is similar to sales in that it is generally a lot easier to sell an idea to an existing partner than it is to find a new one. How many times have you heard about technology companies “deepening a relationship” by announcing a brand-new initiative that builds on top of an existing relationship? That’s the equivalent of a repeat sale or a repeat customer in the world of sales.

6. Commit to “win-win” deals that grow the pie for everyone.

Your business development team should be thinking about creating strategic alliances and partnerships that are good for both sides and not just your company. That’s called a “win-win” deal, and for good reason — both sides can succeed as a result of the deal, and that helps to grow the pie for everyone. Plus, once you get the reputation for signing fair deals that benefit everyone, companies could be beating down your door with potential offers.

In the technology consulting or software product engineering fields, it can be easy to fall into the “growth for growth’s sake” trap. Are the new deals you’re signing really aligned with the strategic vision of your company, or are you just signing them because they’re low-hanging fruit and easy to sign? You want to be signing deals that really propel your company forward and not signing them just so that you can issue a new press release.

By following these seven business development techniques, you can help set your company up for an exciting future of accelerated business growth. You could be one step ahead of the competition in signing up new business partners and one step closer to being a market leader in your industry. It’s time to start changing the way you do business.",None
"Recently, I was in a meeting with a general manager of a hotel. It was a rather large facility with a small conference center. The facility had restaurants, meeting rooms, and of course, hotel rooms and suites, so there was a lot to manage.

The sales manager introduced me to the general manager because she felt that the facility was lacking some basic human resources processes and programs. As a result, the three of us sat down, and the gentleman said, “Well, Ed, I think we could use some training. Why don’t you give me a quote on doing some training here?”

I said, “Whoa, let’s take a step back. Why do you believe you need training?”

He went on to tell me about all the experiences he’s had through his 40-year hospitality career, all the brands he’d worked for, and the sizes of organizations and departments he had managed.

All that was fine, except— he didn’t answer my question as to what his problems actually were.

He was so quick to jump in that there were several times when he cut me off in discussion to answer a question prior to my even asking it. It was clear to me that he already had his replies set and that this was his management style.

One item we discussed was compensation. What scared me was that he believed in giving across-the-board raises to people regardless of their current pay. He believed that if he didn’t do this, people would leave.

I tried to explain that that’s not what studies show actually happens, and that when we do mass raises, where everyone gets the same increase, it actually demotivates the workforce.

He said, “Yeah, but people will leave if I don’t, and I need bodies here.”

I share this story because as a leader, it was clear to me that he felt he knew everything. But even more damaging: He wasn’t willing to sit back and entertain ideas of how things could be if he tried something different that was perhaps out of his comfort zone.

To me, that’s a critical flaw in the skill set of a leader. It all circled back to either his lack of desire or his inability to truly listen and hear some of the ideas I was trying to convey to him.

There’s no shortage of thoughts on what the top leadership skills are in today’s business environment. If you asked various folks for their opinions on the top five leadership skills, you might get some in common, but you’d likely hear different things, too.

I want to talk about the one leadership skill that I think supersedes all others. You can’t get the other skills right if you don’t get this one right.

What is this skill? Communication.

When I think about everything that falls under the communication umbrella, I think of active listening, the ability to tell stories as a way to create buy-in and share our vision among followers, nonverbal communication skills and how we present ourselves to others or in front of large groups. Certainly, our presentation and public speaking skills come into play here.

There are many key skills rolled up into the big communication umbrella, and that’s why I believe it’s the No. 1 skill we need to develop as leaders.

I read a powerful quote the other day by Stephen Covey. He said that most people don’t listen with intent to understand— they listen with intent to reply.

That resonated with me deeply. I would ask readers to think about how often they’re in a meeting or listening to a significant other while already crafting a response versus truly listening to understand the information that’s being conveyed.

As leaders, if we can truly listen with intent to understand rather than to reply, we make better-informed decisions. If our brains are in reply mode, we’re missing out on facts that might be pertinent to our decision. We might jump the gun with our reply and go off in the wrong direction.

So, when I think about communication as the big umbrella of a leader’s skill set, I know some readers will say, “No, Ed. It’s about being able to motivate followers,” or “It’s about delegating responsibilities,” or “You have to be able to keep things positive.” The list could go on and on.

But if you think about the examples I just mentioned, doesn’t a leader’s ability to do those things come back to their ability to communicate?

You can’t motivate your people if you can’t effectively communicate your vision and the strategy that has been developed to achieve that vision. You can’t effectively delegate projects and processes to your people if you can’t communicate the hows, the whys and the expectations of the work that’s being delegated.

That’s why, when you look back at some of history’s most influential leaders, whether nefarious or not, you’d be hard-pressed to find one who wasn't also a great communicator.

In fact, if history shows us anything, it’s that someone can rise to a leadership position without perhaps the requisite resume just because they have effective communication skills. That’s how critical it is for a leader to be a good communicator.

I started out with Stephen Covey’s idea that we need to listen with the intent to understand. I’d like to close with a thought from John Maxwell: “Listening is the foundation for all leadership decisions.”

If we’re not listening and we’re making decisions, we’re acting more like dictators than leaders. How are you practicing effective communication as a leader in your organization?",None
"Dr. I.P. Park, LG Electronics president and chief technology officer, set the tone for the massive Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2019 with a pre-show keynote address set squarely upon the power of artificial intelligence and its future intersection with consumers. Dr. Park addressed a packed auditorium of industry professionals at the Park Theater inside the new Park MGM in Las Vegas, Nevada and posed a strategy and vision by which LG will work to make the lives of its consumers better through technology, most notably that of artificial intelligence and robotics.  However, when it comes to the untread terrain of AI, this could truly be a taller order to fill than one might imagine.

Dr. Park began his address by noting that the 60-year-old company has been a long-time leader in consumer appliances and will now leverage such expertise into intelligent machines powered by AI. ""LG is starting a new chapter,"" said Park. ""The answer is in AI.""

Park spoke about the fact that home appliances had led to a reduction in the number of hours applied to household chores yet that this trend slowed while cognitive labor, that of updating one's computer and phone systems, installing updates and navigating a tech-driven culture, has risen. Thus, the focus of LG seems to be to use certain machines to alleviate specific demands and choices rather than burden us with increased tasks.

Thus, LG's vision is to apply artificial intelligence in a manner that truly supports our lives by understanding our actual intent in actions and recommending the best ways to execute a task rather than simply following orders. This is about a focus on machines that offer more personalized care that connect seamlessly with one's lifestyle and machines that are able to learn and evolve with the user. A basic example of this is washing machines that help create optimal experiences of less water usage and quieter operating durations based on various patterns of the user or automatic volume adjustment of televisions such as that which LG already offers via its Alpha 9 capability.

Park says such a strategy is a new vision in technology. Dubbed LG ThinQ, Park explains that this is not a new brand but rather a true user-centric vision in the company's offering. Via this vision, LG plans to free the consumer of mundane choices and notes that the longer the interaction between machine and consumer, the better service the machines will be able to provide.  ""Just like with a friendship,"" Park explained.

To that end, Park introduced several experts in the field of AI who were featured on stage at various points in support of the promise and future of AI. This included tech founder and author Andrew Ng; Professor Henrik Christensen of UC San Diego; Dr. Durga Malladi, Senior Vice President of Engineering at Qualcomm; Alwin Bakkenes, Executive Vice President of Automotive at Luxoft; and, oh yes, LG's robotic assistant Cloi.

Some of the most intriguing parts of the presentation was that of actually reimaging the experience and space of autonomous vehicles. The intent is to make the vehicle an intelligent space like that of a living room. LG's vision is to create a ""mobile experience"" by enveloping the passenger with a large screen-like environment where one can use travel time to do everything from banking to conversing with a friend in a virtual manner. No trip would be complete without the smart seat that adjusts to one's seating preferences and an algorithm-packed headset that adjusts sound. One could also purchase a beverage while in the car to sip while experiencing the ride.

Park noted that such a vision will require a new, wide range of solutions in hardware and software and thus stated that the company will ensure open collaboration with developers around the world for their WebOS plan to which the sound of audience applause was heard.

And there are many other elements within Park's address that are compelling. However, the missed opportunity still seems to be any inclusion of and/or reference to long-term sociological and psychological research on the impact of such offerings. Is there something to be said for learning how to adapt and or problem-solve around certain mundane activities? What happens when that is taken away? Should AI-powered refrigerators think for you when it comes to dinner choices in terms of what is ""better""? What happens when these parts of the brain are consistently no longer needed?

Do we need to be surrounded by screens any more than we are and obliterate free thought (i.e. daydreaming) from which creative ideas often come during such passive moments like being a passenger in a car? What happens when every moment and everything is, well, optimized? Who gets to decide the definition of a ""better"" life, particularly when the only female represented on such a stage is that of a robot's voice who is asked to fetch male executives beer? What kind of expectations of life are created going forward, and is an appliance company equipped to answer such questions for which it is inserting itself as part of a larger ecosystem where accountability needs to rear its head at some point?

Such questions belie the challenges that AI poses for which we have barely begun to think deeply on a collective level.

True innovation in the, hopefully, near future will be that which not only takes a holistic approach but also encourages dialogue around the findings on cultural impact and acknowledges the various possibilities just as much as it values the power of the technology itself.",None
"Working globally requires unlearning, as much as it requires learning.

Doing business can be challenging enough with people from our own culture. Doing business across cultures adds a whole new layer of complexity. But the reality of modern business is that we work with colleagues, customers and business partners from diverse backgrounds, across the country and across the world.

So how to make sure that our business interactions are a success? How to not let cultural differences and communication challenges get in the way? To be truly effective when working globally requires a shift in mindset, and making that shift means first dropping some of our pre-existing views.

Working more effectively on the global stage is more than a matter of learning. Unlearning is required to make that mindset shift.

Here are three things you need to unlearn.

Culture can be defined as ""the way we do things around here,"" with every culture having its own norms and standards of expected behavior. Of course, those are not always apparent to someone from outside that culture, but they may also not be apparent to those of us inside our own culture.

Just like fish might not know they're swimming in the water, we're often unaware of the cultural surroundings we move through and of how that influences our assumptions about the right way to behave. We all have assumptions about the ""right"" way to do things and all those assumptions, accrued over our lives and influenced by our culture, is what we think of as common sense.

As Voltaire said, ""Common sense is not so common."" This is true between individuals, and even more true between cultures. What is common sense in one culture is rarely common sense in another.

So that is the first thing to drop when working globally, our common sense.

Before we can think about cultural differences, we need to first understand our own cultural assumptions and our common sense. Drop your assumptions, have an open mind and ask yourself ""Why do we behave this way?"" How do people in your culture disagree, build trust or view formality?

Identifying your common sense—and being ready to drop it in cross-cultural settings—is only a first step, but it is a valuable benchmark. Once you have that benchmark, then you can be ready to stop relying on what is common sense in your culture when working globally. You can begin to understand where any major gaps lie and where your own common sense won't work.

This mindset has served me well working in Tokyo. When I'm in a business situation and some behavior seems to be going counter to my expectations, I take that as a sign to pause, take a step back and question what's going on and whether my assumptions are leading me to miss something. For example, say there's a long period of silence in a meeting. Has something uncomfortable been said? That would be my assumption as a Canadian. But when I drop that assumption and go with the flow by staying silent—rather than speaking out to fill what feels to me like awkward silence—I learn the value of unspoken communication and silence in Japanese business culture.

Most cultures have some variation of the Golden Rule: ""treat other people how you would want to be treated yourself."" If you don't want someone to be a jerk to you, it helps to not be a jerk to others.

So when working across cultures, the Golden Rule should be a great rule to live by, right?

Why? Because of those differences in common sense and assumptions about what is the right way to treat people and be treated.

Our different contexts and backgrounds lead to different ideas about what is the best way to treat other people, and so how we expect to be treated. If you treat people from other cultures by your standards, by how you expect to be treated, you're setting yourself up for disaster. Conversely, don't expect those from other cultures to treat you in the ways you expect.

A better idea is to replace the Golden Rule with the Platinum Rule, which is ""treat other people how they would want to be treated."" Treat your counterparts by their standards, not by yours.

Applying that Platinum Rule requires studying other cultures, to learn what is considered the appropriate way to behave and how people in that culture like to be treated. Not an easy thing to do, but with time and practice we can learn about other cultures, learn about our counterparts and then turn that into action. Understand how others negotiate, communicate, disagree, build and maintain trust. Then make sure you can stretch your own behavior—and suppress your assumptions—as much as possible to understand your counterparts' culture; know when to shake hands or bow, speak up or be silent.

Studying other cultures is a necessity and using that knowledge in tandem with the Platinum Rule will start you on the path to cross-cultural competence. But to be truly effective, you need to make one final shift in mindset.

When working across cultures, there is a natural tendency to focus on differences, as that's where we're most likely to step on landmines and encounter challenges. A lot of the literature and training on cross-cultural communication dwells on gaps and differences, but understanding differences is not enough to build meaningful business relationships across borders.

To communicate and collaborate effectively, we need to build stronger bridges by also thinking about cultural similarities. Don't focus too much on cultural challenges and what separates us, also consider the opportunities and what unites us.

Do that through finding what we have in common with others, just as we do with people in our own culture. Finding commonalities and similarities is the way to build meaningful business relationships within a culture and across cultures, so look for similarities between your culture and that of your counterpart.

Even if we find few cultural commonalities, we can consider what we may have in common with our counterparts as individuals. Try to make a personal connection around common work experiences or even more basic things like food or hobbies. Get to know your counterparts as individuals, not simply as representatives of Country X. Find something you share and start building bridges from those commonalities. Regardless of cultural differences, we are all humans and share the same basic wishes and hopes.

By dropping these three things, you can shift your mindset and be a more effective global business leader. Everything that comes later—studying cultures and turning that into action—will work much better once you have made this mindset shift.",None
"It must have been wonderful to be Steve Jobs -- especially when he returned to Apple in 1997 after being fired by John Sculley in 1985. During his second time as Apple CEO, Jobs was able to invent new products targeting large existing markets -- MP3 players, smartphones, and tablets. Enough people liked the iPod, iPhone, and iPad that Apple did spectacularly well until his tragic death in October 2011.

But Jobs was not a perfect person. In addition to his jaw-dropping cruelty to people including his daughter Lisa -- as described in her spectacular book Small Fry -- Jobs disdained market research. Instead, he believed that he knew better than customers what they ought to want and made it his life's work to give it to them.

Jobs was right about market research -- as long as he was CEO. But since then, Apple has been run by a CEO who lacks Jobs's innovation talent. To be sure, market research will not make up for what Tim Cook lacks, but it would sure help Apple avoid the blunders that have led to its current woes.

What woes? Apple's stock has plunged 36 percent from its high and its revenues for the most recent quarter are expected to decline sharply. Since early October 2018, Apple has lost a whopping $400 billion in stock market value, according to YahooFinance.

He pinned the blame on weak iPhone sales in China. ""Lower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance,"" according to Cook.

What does this have to do with Steve Jobs and his contempt for market research? If Apple had done any market research, it would have realized that its products are simply not competitive in the minds of consumers.

And based on two mini-case studies we'll examine below, it's pretty clear to me that Apple is losing the CPC battle for the consumer because it does not do market research.

1. Apple is not competitive in China.

Apple seems to realize that its products are over-priced. Cook noted that ""iPhone upgrades were not as strong as we thought they would be."" He attributed the disappointment to higher prices due to ""fewer carrier subsidies, US dollar strength-related price increases, and some customers taking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements.""

Apple is not competitive in China where domestic brands supply smartphones with ""new features and products that take into account what Chinese users want, for a small fraction of the price while Apple has mostly failed to localize itself,"" according to the New York Times.

Apple clearly lost the CPC battle with Chinese rivals like Xiaomi and Huawei. Apple's product was much more expensive and instead of providing users with what they wanted -- a big screen and a dual SIM card (to save consumers money on watching videos) -- Apple made a gold version for China's show-off nouveau riche, noted the Times.

2. Apple's latest versions are over-priced in the U.S.

One Ohio housewife is hanging on to her three year old iPhone 6S. As she told the New York Times, ""The phone I have does just about everything I need. Why pay $800 for a new one just to be up to date? My needs aren't that complicated.""",None
"A new year, new goals, right? It’s human nature to want to start a new year with lofty goals for improving everything from your diet to your relationships and your finances. But when it comes to one’s financial agenda, many experts agree that goals without specific associated metrics are nothing more than pie-in-the-sky wishes.

“Unfortunately, being ‘better with money’ is a hard goal to stick to when compared to other resolutions,” says Misty Lynch, behavioral financial advisor and certified financial planner at Twine. “When compared to other resolutions like losing 10 pounds or quitting smoking, not everyone can see your progress and it’s unlikely that people will be there to cheer you on in the same way.”

With that in mind, here are some metrics to help you cheer yourself along and stick to those 2019 money goals.

When it comes to personal finances, it’s key that your goals be related to specific numbers, says money coach Beverly Miller.

“Without a specific numerical metric, it’s impossible to create a clear step-by-step plan to reach the goal,” says Miller. “‘I want to retire by age 60’ is not sufficient because retiring is not a metric. A metric would be, for example, having a nest egg of $3 million that will produce a $120,000 yearly income at a 4% draw rate by age 60. Retiring provides the motivation to carry out the shorter-term actions that cause you to realize the goal.”

Additional numerical metrics you might set for yourself include “paying off $50,000 debt, saving $20,000 dollars for a car, or saving $80,000 dollars for my kids’ college,” said Miller.

Having a goal to pay off your student loans or get out of debt is admirable but it may take years of payments, said Lynch.

Begin by setting a different goal such as paying an extra $100 per month above your minimum payment or switching to a different payment option that reduces the principal on a loan faster. These smaller goals will be easier to measure as you get started and also easier to accomplish.

 Your bigger goals can trigger new short-term metrics and milestones, adds Miller.

“For example, if I’m to have a $3 million nest egg by age 60 then invest X amount per month for Y years at Z percent return,” said Miller. “The big goal generates smaller goals as steps along the way, each with a quantifiable outcome and date.”

When people make resolutions they usually do so with the hopes that they will improve over the course of the year. However, if you have a specific, important financial goal, such as creating a will or obtaining life insurance for your family, set a specific date on the calendar that you will have it done by.

“You don’t have to take on everything at once but make the most important goals a priority and get them done first,” said Lynch.

It can be exciting to get started on goals as the new year begins, but making major changes all at once can sometimes backfire. Set dates throughout the year to check your progress and tweak your plan if needed.

“For example, if you decided to put away 15% of your income into your retirement plan but realize after a few paychecks you don’t have enough left, it is better to readjust your goal rather than quit,” said Lynch.

Financial professionals or online tools and calculators can help you project what your savings or investing goals will look like if you decide to make changes, said Lynch.",None
"The further we distance ourselves from a sandstorm, the clearer our vision. Thus, with more informed introspection, I share a two-year progress report of life post-corporate. I'm happy to share that my eyes haven't deceived me--it's an oasis I've found. Here are 11 reasons why.

1. My values are my org chart now.

I used to ponder my sector's organization chart and wonder how high I'd elevate. I'd compare myself with others in other roles. Now I compare myself only with who I was yesterday and whether or not I'm a better version of myself. Whether or not I'm filling the position that each of my non-negotiable values requires me to fill. My values are now my board of directors.

3. We're built for flexible days, not 9-5 ones.

When leaving corporate, you immediately notice the purest of joys--flexibility. That hasn't changed. It's hard to explain how life-changing flexibility is until you have it. Freedom of choice. Flow to the work and what enables you to flow when you work. The Industrial Revolution did us wrong with its 9-5 handcuffs.

With flexibility, I'm also experiencing far more of the spaces-in-between with my family. Sometimes it's picking up my daughter from school. Other times it's helping to start dinner. Every time it adds up. It's the quiet spaces between the loud ones that echo.

4. Instead of wondering where the day went, I'm adding more of them to my life.

No more days that get away from me. I'm adding time now by being twice as productive. I'm adding time to my life (literally) by prioritizing more exercise, less stress, and a better diet.

One thing that hasn't changed since I left corporate is that I want to be successful. So sue me. And it turns out, I really can do this entrepreneur thing--it's a massive world with plenty for those who hustle.

6. My ceiling is based on seeing possibilities, not promotions.

I no longer wait to see how I'm stacking up compared with others to see if I'll rise. I'm limited only by limited thinking, which is drowned out by sky's-the-limit thinking. What my boss thinks of me no longer defines me. Living up to others' standards has been permanently replaced by living up to my own.

7. Learning and growth are no longer distant, they're constant.

8. I control my meetings, they no longer control me.

Once a week, I'll hold a few business-critical meetings. You remember, the kind with an actual point to them? It's hard to explain what a profoundly dampening effect meetings have on your life until you've warmed yourself by the fire of freedom.

9. I have fewer, but deeper relationships. Isn't that where we're all headed anyway?

10. Next year's revenue is always unknown. And it's thrilling.

Counting on only yourself for ""survival"" is satisfying at the most primal level. It's all we had originally as a species. As an entrepreneur, you're hunter, gatherer, and more. It's a life of variety. Between variety or a sameness to work, I'll take the former. I'm not bashing all corporate jobs, just what mine had become. I'll take the gig economy over the gag economy.

11. Everything has led up to what I'm doing now.",None
"Charismatic people are magnetic. You do not even need to talk to them to feel attracted. Crossing with them in the street is enough to feel the electric power of their genuity. You can see transparent through their smile. You feel cared about in their presence. You are sure you can trust their word, and you would always want to join their team.

Charisma is a core element of real leaders. Everything starts with authenticity. Charismatic leaders do not need to imitate others because they feel comfortable in their own skin. They are humble enough to learn from others while keeping and spreading their own essence around. Parallelly, charismatic leaders have high levels of self-awareness. They know that charisma is not about manipulating others bending them to their own advantage. Charisma is about controlling our own mind and behavior, so our actions become excellent enough as to inspire in others the desire of emulation.

Some people have it natural, but many others have just developed it by consciously cultivate specific behaviors. The good news is that charisma can be taught and exercise through different steps helping leaders to become memorable. The executive coach and charisma expert Olivia Fox Cabane have defined three main elements critical to achieving the ""it"" factor of charismatic leaders: presence, power, and warmth. Balancing and practicing them until they become natural through the following tips will help you to unleash your own magnetism and become the role model everyone wants close every morning.

Charismatic leaders make you feel they are entirely with you and intensely into your conversation. They place you at the center of the universe and make you feel good about yourself without trying to impress you with their amazingness.

Presence requires a vast effort of focus, and it just works correctly when we really care about the other person. It cannot be faked, but different techniques can be used to concentrate mental and emotional energy during interactions to ensure that others feel important and acknowledged.

Charismatic leaders get you to feel that they can make things happen. With an irresistible aura that draws people into their orbit, they ensure their ability to affect the world around us. Easily equated to money, fame, strength or social status, power goes further than this. It is not just about making others obey but ensuring that they freely follow because it is good for them to do so.

Warmth is this element of charisma that makes people feel smooth and comfortable. Charismatic leaders are approachable, caring and full of goodwill. For warmth to be authentic, it has to go deeper than a selfish motive and pursuit true empathy and care. Warmth requires as foundations a genuinely good heart. As of this layer, different techniques can help you boost your inner warmth.

Above all, make sure to put your strengths at the service of others. The difference between leaders and tyrants is the way they use their power. A charismatic leader always uses their influence for the benefit of others without utilitarian reasons. Win-win situations are always possible, and every great power entails great responsibility!",None
"Something troubling has been happening to me lately. Men appear to be afraid of me. A male superior at work asked, “Is it okay to say that?” after complimenting me on a new pair of “funky” boots. Another man apologized profusely after tapping my elbow. A male colleague called after a tense, but completely professional conversation to make sure that, “You are okay and don’t feel like I was rude.”

While this extreme politeness could indicate that the #MeToo movement is having a positive impact, it’s more likely a sign that men are unsure of how to interact with women. It’s an unintended consequence of the movement, which could set both men and women back to the wrong outcome — a world where men are advised never to meet with women alone to avoid any chance of being called out for harassment.

Recent surveys substantiate my experience. Lean In and SurveyMonkey found that nearly half of male managers are uncomfortable participating in mentoring, working alone, or socializing together with women, and that the number of male managers who are uncomfortable mentoring women has more than tripled. A recent Harvard Business Review study exploring the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements' impacts on creating lasting improvements in their organizations revealed some “adverse reactions.”

“Men and women are not talking to each other. The environment is becoming sterile and completely unenjoyable to work in,” replied one survey member. According to the survey, 65% of men indicated that since the movements began it’s “less safe” to mentor and coach their female colleagues. This unintentional consequence hurts the women the movement was meant to serve.

“There is fear of not wanting to say the wrong thing, to be blamed, or to be part of what could be a harsh workplace environment,” Marcus Patterson tells me. Mr. Patterson recently completed research on how to engage men in achieving women’s equality for Ellevate Network, a network for professional women.

“Strangely, it’s men who aren’t doing anything wrong who are feeling needlessly nervous,” says Dr. Arin Reeves, a leading researcher in workplace leadership and president of employment advisory firm Nextions. “The men who are not nervous are probably the ones to worry about.”

But let’s talk about the elephant in the room — why are so many men stumbling in their ordinary discourse and interactions with women at work? It could be the belief that minor behavioral lapses, far below the standard of sexual harassment, have ruined other men’s careers.

They’ve become distrustful of women colleagues whom they believe may be looking for an opportunity to falsely yell, “Me too!” Of course, there are bad actors still lurking in the office, but this mistrust comes with a huge opportunity cost for working women — missing out on mentorship by men with valuable experience and skill sets to share.

We get why men are nervous. “We talk about what are wrong behaviors, but we never as a country, as a culture, talk about what the right behaviors are,” says Reeves. “Imagine if someone watched you eat for week, and pointed out all the stuff that was unhealthy, but never thought to tell you about what was healthy. You’d be nervous every time you picked up a fork.”

So, to all our male colleagues — it’s okay to compliment a haircut or outfit. But think short and to the point: “Nice haircut!” or “Love the new shoes!” Don’t comment on how someone’s body looks, how their appearance makes you feel, or what someone should wear. More importantly, think about complimenting women for their work, rather than just their appearance.

As for mentoring and meetings, if it’s feels uncomfortable to take a woman out to a drink, then take her to breakfast, lunch, or coffee. If you are still uncertain, consider mentoring a pair of women or larger group and take them out together. Another idea that Reeves offers to male mentors: Let the mentee drive the relationship. She suggests telling her: “Please tell me how often, when, and where you want to meet.""

“I don’t think it should be this way, but having a more defined structure and outline could help some men keep any perception of inappropriateness out of the conversation,” says Patterson.

It’s the good guys who are understandably nervous — and we appreciate why you’re uncomfortable in this brave new world of office politics. But please continue braving those nerves to talk with us, meet with us, and mentor us — just as you would male colleagues. We need to work together more now than ever.

"For the first time in 24 years, Bill Gates is no longer the . Jeff Bezos, the centibillionaire founder of Amazon, has ascended to that enviable position of power.

Bezos’ path was supported by a myriad of advisers. He was mentored by the legendary Bill Campbell, a former Columbia University football player, coach, and trustee who served as the CEO of Intuit. Campbell also counted Steve Jobs, Larry Page and Sergey Brin among his impressive cohort of mentees.

These mentor relationships demonstrate that these ultimately high-powered corporate leaders were not content to passively let their careers “happen.” Instead, they invested in developing themselves through coaching and other means outside their organizations — and they achieved paramount success.

In an age of , where employers demonstrate hesitancy to invest in developing individual employees who are likely to leave before a return on learning is realized, self-career development is an increasingly important component of individuals’ success in the workplace. For ambitious employees, self-development is an effective way, and, in some cases the only way, to hasten progress along the career ladder. As an ardent advocate of professional learning, I recommend the following tactics to assume control of your development and accelerate your career:

At photography stalwart Kodak, the median job tenure is approximately 20 years, according to a 2013 . In stark contrast, at technology powerhouse Google, the tenure is slightly more than a year. Millennials are switching jobs at unprecedented rates and no longer depend on a pre-established career track to advance to higher level positions.

When combined with the fact that one third of employees report that their bosses do not assist with career development, it is apparent that today’s workers must be proactive. Rather than assuming ascent along a regimented career ladder – as prior generations may have done – employees today must be strategic about what can be gained from each position. Focus on attaining marketable skills, gaining experience with employers whose names stand out on a resume, and, most importantly, building a robust stable of supporters.

One way for professionals to supercharge their networks is to find a mentor—as many successful entrepreneurs have done. According to a survey by the Association for Talent Development (ATD), the top three benefits to mentees are professional development, a better understanding of organizational culture, and the development of new perspectives.

While more than half the mentees ATD surveyed credited formal mentoring programs for helping them meet their goals to a “high” or “very high” extent, fewer than one-third of the businesses actually offer formal mentoring programs. In the absence of workplace mentorship programs, rising employees, by necessity, must be the architects of their own futures.

Thinking expansively about mentorship can widen the pool of potential mentors, and diversify organizational experiences and perspectives, that comprise a mentee’s career. Mentors need not be senior leaders; a mentor can be a co-worker just a few years ahead on the career ladder, or even a peer or . As long at the mentor has teachable skills and a willingness to partake in knowledge transfer and network building, mentorship can have profoundly positive career impacts.

Modern-day career trajectories are intricately tied to how we are represented in, and by, data—especially online. Human resources departments scan applicants’ resumes for keywords. Recruiters actively search for targeted matches on LinkedIn. Google searches are certainly the default mechanism for identifying potential hires. It is, therefore, vital for employees to make their data available — and to make it shine.

Today’s workers must become their own “Chief Marketing Officer,” constantly analyzing, refining and improving the way they appear in the job market. One of the best approaches to gain a competitive advantage and improve one’s market image is through education—and many options are available.

Shorter-term educational opportunities include informative webinars, weekend workshops, and MOOCs (massive open online courses). For those seeking more in-depth development opportunities, professionally-focused degree programs (such as the master’s degrees at the Columbia University and corporate in-house programs (including BP’s) represent high quality options that provide valuable skills and knowledge as well as marketable credentials.

Further underscoring the importance of an employee’s online presence, credentialing is increasingly taking electronic form. Certified electronic transcripts of coursework completed — and even electronic versions of diplomas — are becoming more prevalent. For example, users who have completed a LinkedIn course can now opt to have the qualification appear on their profiles.

It is indisputable that artificial intelligence, machine learning, and other technological advancements will revolutionize the employment market and recast jobs in unforeseen ways. Yet, even if certain jobs are upended or transformed, market trends indicate that employees with soft skills and emotional intelligence will be the most likely to succeed in the changing workplace.

A 2016 World Economic Forum report predicted that emotional intelligence will be one of the . Another study revealed that, of the eight , STEM ability ranked last after an array of soft skills, including coaching skills, empathy, and problem solving ability.

Ascertaining strengths and weaknesses in soft skills is a critical first step to making improvements, and the best way for individuals to gauge their current proficiency is to ask others for feedback. My Columbia colleague, , recommends that “seeking feedback of how you’re doing — regardless of how threatening the action might be to one’s self-esteem” is vital to career development.

Gallup reports that only of millennial employees routinely ask for such feedback consistently. The small percentage who are willing to have difficult conversations are likely those who are most receptive to changing their behaviors and, I predict, likely to demonstrate the most success in the coming decades.

In contrast to the 1950s ideal of the “company man”, where hard work and loyalty to one firm led to promotion over time, today’s workplace expects greater individuality, creativity, and flexibility from employees. Today, rising to leadership positions requires employees to craft their own self-career development strategies. The stories of Jeff Bezos and other corporate leaders illustrate the power of identifying suitable mentors, gaining feedback, shaping a public persona, and building key leadership skills to accelerate career growth.  These valuable lessons can be applied by all professionals who aspire to higher levels of leadership and will reliably fuel their career rise.",None
"SEO and content marketing deliver the lowest cost per acquisition (CPA), or cost per lead, of any other form of digital marketing. Even if your law firm dedicates most of its marketing budget to television or a robust pay-per-click campaign, you should still have a search engine marketing campaign to bring in those coveted low-cost leads.

For 2019, law firms can expect more competition as more lawyers fight for placement on the search engine results page. Here are five strategies your law firm can use to stay competitive:

1. Don't just look like the best; be the best.

A common misconception about search engine optimization is that it is all about tricks and gimmicks to get Google to think you have the best content. However, the search engine knows what is happening behind the scenes of your website marketing, so gimmicks are not going to fool the algorithms.

Rather than thinking about your law firm's SEO as a magic show, think of it as a fitness test. Focus on building the best content. Look for questions that your clients are asking, and see how your competitors may be falling short on answering those questions. Whatever content your competitors are publishing, make sure yours is more informative, easier to understand and quickly answers your visitors' questions.

2. Page one, rank one is so 2014.

Over the last five years, Google has been selecting page content that gives a concise answer or definition to a search query and placing it in a box at the top of the search results page. This box is called a ""featured snippet."" In the SEO community, it is referred to as ""position zero.""

With well-written content, you can earn featured snippets through Q&A or blog content. When crafting questions, do so in a manner that is similar to how your clients search. For example, nobody is searching for ""Will a grocery store's premises liability policy help me if I'm injured?"" Instead, you should write a Q&A title like: ""Should I sue the grocery store after slipping on a wet floor?"" By presenting questions followed by concise answers, you can encourage Google to use your content as a featured snippet.

Not only can a featured snippet lead to more traffic, but it can also help you optimize for voice searches, which leads us to No. 3.

Research shows that voice-first devices like Alexa and Google Home are currently owned by 39 million Americans. But those devices are just a small fraction of the 2 billion+ activated smartphones that are connected to the internet.

It does not stop there. Windows 10 and newer versions have the Cortana personal assistant; Apple iPhone, iPad and MacOS users have Siri; Android users or anybody who has downloaded the Google App on their mobile device has Google Assistant. Plus, every Chrome browser comes with Google Assistant, which can be activated by clicking on the blue microphone icon.

Voice is only getting more popular. With Google Assistant, whenever you ask a question, those answers are powered by websites that have featured snippets. If your law firm has the featured snippet, a voice searcher will hear an answer that starts with: “According to [Law Firm Name]” and then the content of the featured snippet.

To optimize for voice search, write content that answers the question first and then goes into details. For example, one of our clients is currently listed in a featured snippet for the question: ""Are programmers exempt from overtime in California?""

They answer the question in the first two paragraphs but then provide examples of exempt salaries. It offers readers a lot of valuable information on the topic.

When answering a question, start with what the user is looking for. In this case, it might be something along the lines of: ""It would depend. The law states that to be exempt from overtime, computer professionals or programmers must be paid a minimum salary and have advanced job duties.""

Start with a concise answer, and if the topic warrants it, go into more details.

The value of links in search engine marketing is well-known. Of course, the days of bulk directory submissions, link-buying and link exchanges are behind us. Link-building is not entirely about getting websites to link to your law firm's website. You can boost the quality of your own website by linking out to high-authority sources.

Outbound links give your content authority by showing that your content is well researched and backed up by legitimate sources. For example, if you are writing about car accident rates, you could link to a government study or a report published by the insurance industry. If you are writing about estate planning, you could link to a news publication regarding either changes in the law or perhaps a situation relating to a celebrity.

The goal of outbound linking is to show both search engines and your readers that you are not just making something up. Your content is based on facts, and the sources of those facts are well documented.

If it's been a while since your website has been updated, it might be time for a rebuild. A new website can be built around Google's mobile-first indexing, include schema markups, which can help you earn more featured snippets and overall improve your user experience.

A great website experience is one that:

• Offers interactive elements that keep visitors engaged with your content.

• Clearly describes what your law firm does, showcases your results and helps visitors get to know the attorneys on your team.

• Is designed with easy navigation and clear calls to action and makes it easy for visitors to contact your firm without having to figure anything out.

By focusing on the user, delivering high-quality content and refreshing your website, your law firm can compete in the crowded search results pages in 2019.",None
"I have a confession to make: Until recently, I wasn’t much of a writer.

For years, I was happy to hand the keyboard to others. But as I became more comfortable as a CEO and speaker, I started to experiment. At first, I wrote a journal entry here and a blog post there. After plenty of practice, I began working on Top of Mind. In the process, I noticed something: Not only did I enjoy writing, but I was becoming a better leader in the process.

Don’t believe me? Write something — a blog post, a poem, or even a thank-you note — every day. By writing consistently, you’ll:

Improve Your Sense of Self

Even before I began writing regularly, I admired E. E. Cummings, who said, “It takes courage to grow up and become who you really are.” Although Cummings was a poet, he would’ve made a wise leader.

Great leaders strive to become their best themselves. They see who they currently are, what they want to do, and how others can help them get there. The more they learn about themselves before and during that journey, the more authentic and effective they tend to be.

Treat writing as a chance to discover your true self. By becoming a more authentic version of yourself, you’ll boost employee satisfaction, happiness, and organizational commitment. Getting those thoughts out of your head and onto the page helps you understand not only your own behaviors and tendencies, but also those of your team members.

But writing doesn’t just help me understand my long-term goals; it also helps me plan my short-term work. I can’t count, for instance, how many times I’ve laid awake at night worrying about an upcoming meeting or school event. Writing helps me untie my mental shoelaces so that I can get to sleep and wake up with a plan.

If your primary reason for writing is task-related, consider bullet journaling. For something less structured, try jotting down tomorrow’s goals every evening before bed. For example, I write down my three priorities for the next day right after I put my kids to bed. If those priorities are meetings or assignments, I add them to my calendar with some notes.

How can writing down your priorities before bed make you a better leader? When you get up, you’ll feel ready to tackle the day. You’ll know what you need to get done, and you’ll be less prone to distraction. By getting those shards of stress out of your head, you’ll focus more tightly on your true goals.

Whether you’re a startup CEO like me or a Fortune 500 executive, you must be a effective communicator. If you can’t share your ideas clearly, you’ll struggle to rally your team around them.

By writing regularly, you’ll come to understand the connotations of your words. Not only will you improve your emails and elevator pitches, but you’ll connect more closely with leads and peers. Plus, you’ll minimize misunderstandings by communicating concisely. Neither you nor your team members have time to sort through a word salad for the important points.

Best of all, writing consistently helps you clarify your purpose. If you can’t fit your intentions in the space of a tweet, you’ll struggle to get them out into the wider world. Once you can, you’ll find others are much more eager to share the news.

Business today is, well, busy. You already have a full schedule, which can make it tough to find time to write in your journal or compose a blog post.

For better or worse, writing regularly requires you to ritualize it. You might dedicate your morning time to journaling, or you might set aside your lunch hour for blog writing. The type of writing and time of day aren’t important; what’s important is sticking with it, which requires discipline.

Especially if you’re new to writing, don’t worry about whether your work is “good.” Just sit down at the same time every day, open that Word document, and get started. If you’re stuck, just type your stream of consciousness. Slowly but surely, you’ll become both a better writer and a more diligent person.

When a top employee quits, a project falls through, or a customer leaves in anger, it’s easy to bottle up that stress. Not only can doing so cause you to lash out at your team, but it can seriously harm your mental health.

Fortunately, research shows that writing can reduce anxiety by giving you a chance to constructively process your emotions. Emotional writing helps you vent, count your blessings, and learn from negative experiences. In doing so, it helps you keep track of the bigger picture.

Although writing for 20 minutes per day about positive experiences may be the best way to improve your mood and health, don’t discount briefer sessions. Writing for just two minutes has been shown to reduce health complaints and facilitate healing.

Like most things in life, the toughest part of writing is getting started. Particularly if you’re not a natural writer, like me, then you may need some help getting started:

I may not be a novelist, but I’m no longer a novice, either. I write to understand myself, relate to others, communicate my goals, and get more done. I’m a leader, and I’m better at it because I bothered to pick up the pen.",None
"Job interviews are designed to assess you in three areas: personality, aptitude, and experience. Just because you have the skills and work history to do the job, doesn't mean you'll get it. Hiring managers also needs to feel your communication style and ability to adapt to the corporate culture are in sync with what the company needs. As a result, hiring managers like to ask behavioral questions designed to get you to open up and share more about yourself. These questions can be very tricky to answer. Especially, questions focused on your previous employers and your reasons for leaving.

Resigned or fired? It doesn't matter, something went wrong - and the hiring manager wants to know what it was.

If you are interviewing for a job, then something about your current employer is falling short. And, if you are currently unemployed, then something definitely happened with your last employer that didn't end well. Either way, the answer is difficult to articulate.

You have to be extremely careful not to allow too much emotion to creep into your response.

HR professionals are taught early on there are three sides to every career situation: your's, their's, and the truth. That means you have to try to present the facts as objectively as possible. If your answer is long-winded and shares how you were wronged, or why it wasn't in any way your fault, I guarantee you won't get hired. One of the biggest mistakes job seekers make is blaming former employers. Accountability is key. You need to own the situation. You were the one that took the job. You worked there. As the saying goes, ""it takes two to tango.""

So, how do you answer without throwing the employer under the bus?

The key is to walk the hiring manager through a set of events leading up to the point where the job no longer met your needs. Talk about what you experienced, what it taught you, and how you have come to realize it's no longer a fit for your needs. It's called the Experience + Learn = Grow model for answering interview questions. And it's the safest way to respond. For example, if your current employer doesn't pay enough and you feel you are worth more, you might say:

""I've learned a lot in my last three years at ABC Corp. I've been able to increase my production level by 30 percent. However, when I sat down to discuss how I might earn more money this year, I was told there wasn't room for a raise. I am passionate about growing my skills and my income. So, I realized it was time to see if there might be a new opportunity where I could leverage my higher skill level to grow, while earning something that seems in alignment with the value I'm providing.""

P.S. - Don't forget to end the conversation on a high note.

Once you talk about why your current or past employer is no longer a fit, it's time to pivot the conversation back to why you want the hiring manager's job. Being able to connect yourself to the organization's goals is vital. Hiring managers need to be reassured their job is more than just a way out of a bad situation for you.",None
"As a meeting expert, I get a lot of questions about how to change people behaving badly in meetings. Employees want to know how to influence the leaders who use meetings to hold court. Team members who lurk silently in the back of the room, or who sit at the far end of the table and check their email. The person who talks on and on, seemingly oblivious to others waiting their turn to speak.

All of these questions ask about how to deal with difficult people - how to fix their behavior. I agree with the famous 20th-century inventor R. Buckminster Fuller, who once said:

You can't fix people, but you can model the environment to encourage different behavior. For instance, the physical layout of your meeting space can have a big impact on the group's behavior.

A Gentleman in Moscow is set at the dawn of the Soviet Union. The tale of what happened after Stalin's death perfectly illustrates how the shape of a meeting room can shape the meeting outcome.

Stalin didn't name a successor, leaving several rivals vying to become the new leader. In the book, the leading power players were invited to a dinner meeting. They arrived to find a large U-shaped table with no name tags, and no instructions. Everyone had to sort themselves out and select a place at the table to sit.

Some chose to sit down the legs of the U, and some at the table that formed the base of the U - the head table, as it were. No one claimed the seat in the absolute center of the U, leaving the traditional place of power vacant.

The U-shape setup is an efficient way to seat a lot of people who will either be looking at a presenter positioned at the open part of the U, or at the leader who sits in the top center. It also constrains visibility and interaction for everyone else.

When you see movies depicting meetings between politicians or boards, you'll see rectangular shapes over and over because this is a visual shortcut that communicates the power and dominance part of the story. Game of Thrones fans know that the Small Council in King's Landing sits at a rectangular table with the most dominant member at the head.

Round tables, on the other hand, equalize the power dynamics. They make it possible for everyone at the table to listen to or address anyone else equally. When ideas are shared in writing, they can literally be placed in the common center of the group, becoming the work of ""us"" collectively. The circle is the shape of gathering around a campfire, of collective intent, and unity. Star Wars fans may note that the Jedi council meets in a circle.

How the wrong shape can undermine the meeting

I improvised a lot that day trying to make things work. Despite my best efforts, we ran over time, and the interaction wasn't as dynamic as it needed to be. The group kept staring at me like I was a guest lecturer there to entertain them, rather than a facilitator guiding them to work together. It just wasn't possible to create the same small group intimacy, nor to get as deep into the material as we needed to, when everyone had to awkwardly twist about to hear each other.",None
"Your coaching mindset will set the limits for the level of impact your coaching habits will have on your team's performance. A positive coaching mindset enables you to authentically and effectively apply the coaching habits and reap the ultimate benefit--winning results and relationships. On the other hand, with a negative coaching mindset your coaching habits will inhibit your ability to inspire your team and yield less than optimal results.

There are five positive coaching habits. When they are applied with a positive coaching mindset, you will predictably inspire winning results and relationships. These five habits give your team the biggest boost if applied in sequence, but you should still use your knowledge of each team member to determine when to accelerate through or spend more time on a specific habit.

The root meaning of the verb ""to coach"" means to bring a person from where he or she is to where he or she wants to be. The inspiring coach focuses more on developing a person's natural gifts so each team member can realize his or her potential and while shoring up weaknesses to help each team member master his or her job.

Consider the role of a football coach. He sets clear expectations for his team with a game plan to win. He asks players if they have any questions to ensure they are clear about their respective roles on the team. He also asks them questions like, ""How can you improve your performance or overcome a certain obstacle?"" Then during the game, he involves them in changing the game plan, if necessary, based on what they are seeing on the field. The coach also observes and measures each player's performance (e.g., number of tackles, yards gained, etc.). Finally, the coach gives constructive feedback and recognition so his players can elevate their performance in the next game.

These are the five positive habits that inspiring coaches in business practice to build winning teams:",coaching
"In the early part of December I was lucky enough to attend the Most Contagious event in London. It is run by Contagious, one of the leading, global creative and strategic intelligence services and the event aims to provide an appraisal of the year's most innovative and influential brand campaigns, events, technologies, start-ups and emerging trends from around the world.

The event was kicked off by Paul Kemp-Robertson, co-founder of Contagious, and Chris Barth, it's Lead Strategist, who were talking about their new book: The Contagious Commandments: Ten Steps to Brand Bravery.

Now, Contagious have been at the forefront of thinking about what it takes for brands to stand out in a noisy and crowded marketplace for years now and the commandments that Paul and Chris have compiled are their reflections on what they see is required from brands if they are to thrive now and in the coming years.

Of all of the commandments that they talked about it was the last one: 'Be Brave' that really stood out for me.

That commandment suggests that although studies show that the brains of business people subliminally equate creative (i.e. new and risky) ideas with poison, vomit and agony, creative work is 6 times more effective than non-creative work.

Personally, I don’t see enough of that sort of bravery when it comes to brands in the marketplace right now.

Perhaps then it is business people that are holding brands back.

One business person, however, that didn’t hold back was Martina Poulopati, global brand communication manager at Bodyform (Libresse in some markets) owner Essity, who told the story of their “Blood normal” campaign which was created with their creative agency, Abbott Mead Vickers BBDO.

In choosing to run the #bloodnormal campaign they became the first advertiser ever to depict period blood truthfully.

That broke a whole heap of taboos and caused all sorts of friction.

Despite that they have achieved a huge amount of success with the campaign, which is both challenging and changing the narrative around women’s periods.

But, the part of the story that stood out, in addition to the market and commercial success of their campaign, was the level of bravery that was needed by Martina to bring this campaign to fruition.

At one point, things got so fraught that Martina was recorded as making the following statement:

That level of commitment to doing the right thing for customers is rare. But, it is also inspirational.

As it turns out Martina didn’t lose her job but has been, and rightly so, lauded for her efforts.

Moreover, that campaign has gone on to win a whole heap of awards and has emboldened Bodyform to take on even more taboos.

In an interview for Campaign, Martina suggested that she hoped that their success and experience would inspire and pave the way for other brands to take on their own causes so that they too could drive change in social attitudes.

And, customers are waiting. Waiting for brands to show up and stand up.

According to Edelman’s 2018 Earned Brand Study, 64% of all customers say they will choose, switch, avoid or boycott a brand depending on their stand on social or political issues.

So, the question seems to be, how brave are you willing to be for your customers?

And, are you willing to be Martina brave?

If not, then who is? Your competition?",None
"Getting your résumé to pass an applicant tracking system (ATS) is the goal for most online job applications. Application tracking systems are used a lot in both the U.K. and U.S. because they help recruiters work more efficiently. Can you imagine how overwhelmed and how little time you’d have if you didn’t have a sophisticated email filtering system at work? Effective résumé writing is an art, and it takes time figuring out how to make your résumé stand out from the other 250 applicants. The good news is that you aren’t the only one worrying about your career search. According to Talent Now, this is what the talent market looks and feels like for an employer:

Let’s make everyone’s life easier. I’ve put together some tips that are quick to implement, and they work.

Include the months of your employment and the exact job title.

Most people that come to me don’t usually have gaps longer than four months on their résumé. Those that have taken a career break are typically working moms who took time off for maternity leave.

It can be tempting not to include the months if you worked in a role for less than 12 months in a calendar year, but you’ll rank higher on an ATS if you include the year and date. If your longevity (more than three years for mid-career professionals) in a particular role or at a company is one of your value propositions, then position it on your résumé in a way that will increase readability.

Also, I hate to say it, but every résumé you submit online needs to be tailored to the specific role. Put the job title at the top of your résumé to give it some focus.

Don’t get creative with your work history heading.

Make your employment history subheading something like professional experience or work history - this is language that an ATS will recognize. When directly sending résumés to recruiters, or better yet, individuals in the position to hire you, you can brand yourself differently with the use of a subheading like career history and value impact or career continuity. Career continuity is a good phrase if you’re making a career change and will be weaving in elements that show transferable skills and environments. On senior leadership résumés, I like to use the phrase career progression.

Think of keywords in these three categories:

Use the right font, and get rid of your jargon.

Stick to a professional font that an ATS can process. I use these fonts: Arial, Calibri, Georgia and Helvetica. It’s a good idea to look at what font the company uses, and if it’s one of the fonts above, use the same font. Remember too; if you’ve got some job applications to send out as part of your career search strategy, you’ll need to spell everything out although the human reader will understand your industry abbreviations. Sometimes it’s easy to overlook an acronym you often use because it’s your job to talk the lingo.

But don’t stress, you’re already ahead because you’ve read these suggestions and will act on the tips to get your résumé ranked high. Résumés with a high ATS score get flagged as a file worth opening. Let's get your résumé working for you!

"Put your political perspective and pop culture fandom aside for a moment. Regardless of how you feel about her legal rulings, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg may have some wise career and life advice for you and me. Lately, I have been binging on films, documentaries, biographies, and collections of writing about and by the almost 86 year old justice, also known as the “Notorious RBG.” My binge began with the excellent movie, On the Basis of Sex, starring Felicity Jones as law school student and early-career attorney Ginsburg. Ironically, I saw the movie one day before the Supreme Court announced Justice Ginsburg’s first-ever absence from the bench during Supreme Court oral arguments. Her recent surgery and the necessary recovery time necessitated her unprecedented absence (she will follow the arguments using transcripts from home). As I wish her a speedy recovery and continue my RBG binge, I have been imagining the life and career coaching Justice Ginsburg might offer me if I was to somehow coax her away from the most powerful legal seat in the country, her legendary fitness workouts, and her love for the opera. Here is the advice I imagine she might offer.

Advice for those considering or in a marriage or lifetime partnership

Justice Ginsburg was married to her Cornell classmate, Martin Ginsburg, for 56 years until his passing from cancer. A key feature of their relationship was that they appeared to avoid traditional gender roles. Many heterosexual couples rely on the gender roles dictated by societal norms to determine who cooks dinner, who comforts the children, and who downgrades their professional aspirations to make room for the other partner’s work demands. The norms shape the marriage early on, and the roles calcify into permanent responsibilities, despite the many ways in which life evolves and gets complicated over time. Ruth and Marty remained fluid. Early on, Ruth cooked, and later, Marty took over. Early on, Marty’s career dominated, and then Ruth’s took over. For his time, Marty was an extraordinarily progressive husband, well known for his vocal and active support of his wife’s career.

When my female MBA students seek career advice from me, I often encourage them to consider the lifetime commitments they make with great care. I tell them that nothing will affect their career more than decisions they make about life partners, and whether they are willing and able to negotiate with those partners about domestic responsibilities. Marty Ginsburgs are neither easy nor impossible to find (I am fortunate to be married to one myself). Because today’s societal norms still do not support true egalitarianism in a marriage as evidenced by many studies of domestic division of labor, any redistribution will have to come from within the marriage itself. I imagine Justice Ginsburg would counsel everyone in or considering a marriage to be ready to resist norms and be fluid in their roles, particularly men married to women.

One danger of the iconic narrative that is dominating pop culture about Justice Ginsburg’s life is that it glosses over the day to day challenges she faced as a working mother in a society which did not support her or her husband’s choices, despite their valiant efforts to be fluid. When Ginsburg’s son’s principal kept calling her alone when issues arose at school, she reminded the principal that her son had two parents and asked that they alternate which parent was called. She faced both overt and subtle gender bias in the workplace, and frankly, many of us might have been overcome by attending a law school with no female restrooms and being shunned by law firms despite being first in your class. To support her husband’s career, she moved to New York City before completing her law degree at Harvard, and her female-student-resenting dean would not allow her to remain a Harvard student. Many would have dropped out, but she found a way to attend Columbia Law School instead. The only reason she had any job at all after graduating from the top of Harvard and Columbia Law Schools was that a determined faculty mentor used all his social capital to convince a reluctant judge to hire the recent graduate as a clerk. Many of us would have checked out professionally at this point. Again, Ginsburg did not.

Much has been written about opting in versus opting out, leaning in versus leaning back, staying in the game versus staying at home. I am making a different point, which is borne out by Justice and Marty Ginsburg’s example. Regardless of what life and career choices make sense for you and your loved ones, if you value your profession, stay connected and up to date. Do not completely check out. And pick a partner who will not let you check out. Because Ginsburg stayed connected to her legal work, albeit not in her chosen field of corporate law, and because her husband supported her doing so, her options were always expanding throughout her life despite the shut doors. I think she would encourage us to partner wisely and fluidly.

Advice for those who are older than they used to be

Justice Ginsburg is almost 86 years old, and like a number of women today (as highlighted in this recent article), she remains a powerhouse.  She was already 60 years old when she was appointed to the Supreme Court, making her the oldest junior justice at the time of appointment amongst the current justices; the others were originally appointed between the ages of 43 and 56. I suspect some of the Senators who supported her nomination (96 to 3 votes voted to confirm her nomination) would have put up more resistance if Justice Ginsburg had seemed less like their unconscious stereotype of a petite grandmother and more like their unconscious stereotype of a formidable adversary. Her relatively smooth confirmation could be an example of what I have called the “stereotype tax”, an instance when stereotypes are costly to the stereotype holder (which is not partisan, I suspect senators of both parties fell victim to this unconscious bias).

Still, studies show that ageism is a real force that each of us will (hopefully live long enough to) eventually face. How does Justice Ginsburg counter this bias? I believe that her lifelong multi-tasking, side hustle habit - which she may or may not have intentionally adopted – plays a role. Justice Ginsburg has always juggled multiple professional and family commitments.  She was a mother and caregiver to her husband (diagnosed with cancer) during law school, noting that her caregiving responsibilities were an advantage as they forced a widening of interests and shifting of focus. Later, she was a professor at Rutgers and Columbia Law Schools while working as an attorney arguing cases with the ACLU, expanding her network and impact outside of her academic circles. In the moment, the stress of multi-tasking was countered by the emotional buffer of having multiple identities.

Justice Ginsburg’s multi-tasking appears to have been borne of necessity but it has played an essential role as she has gotten older. At ages when she might have voluntarily or involuntarily been aged out of full-time roles, she was consistently being exposed to new people, new issues, and new opportunities. She was still trying and learning new things, including beginning to work out in her 60s and 70s. She was not dependent on any one institution or person for her income or her identity, making her more likely to take the kind of risks that advance one’s career, as she did in multiple pathbreaking legal battles, long before she joined the Supreme Court.

A recent CBS This Morning segment argues that side hustles are an important way to counter ageism, and Justice Ginsburg’s career would support this advice. Here is the life and career coaching that I glean from Justice Ginsburg’s example. As you approach your 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s and 80s, what opportunity can you add to your life that will broaden your interests and increase your visibility? What interest can you pursue that will deepen your skills while diversifying your sources of emotional well-being? What income source can you generate that will create an alternate path when your industry is disrupted, your skills become obsolete, or you are deemed “non-value-added”?

Advice for those who are in the minority

Justice Ginsburg has a vivid recollection of seeing “no dogs or Jews” signs when she was a child. She came of age during the Holocaust and in the 8th grade, she wrote an essay for her synagogue bulletin about how “we are part of a world whose unity has been almost completely shattered”. Later in her life, she spoke of the connection she saw between anti-Nazi-ism and the civil rights movement in the United States. Fighting injustice has been a critical focus of her life, whether for herself or for others.

She appears optimistic, perhaps because of her deep respect for what has come before her and the progress which has been made. Her writing and speaking is rife with historical references. This investment in knowing how things were before and whose tired shoulders one is standing on seems to have served Justice Ginsburg well as she faced anti-Semitism both as a child and adult. I imagine that it is what has helped her retain a tenacious sense of hope, even when facing tremendous odds against her and the cases she fought for. She seems hyper-aware of injustice and committed to fighting it, and yet patient in the face of it.

I struggle with this a bit, worried that patience in the face of slow progress is the kind of advice that those not overtly harmed by lack of progress are likely to give. It can be code for complacency or concessions. But, a close examination of Justice Ginsburg’s life and work suggests this was not what was happening with her. Her patience should not be confused with acceptance. She consciously took on a role of educating others, even in adversarial legal contexts. She is not known for overwhelming charisma or humor, but her interpersonal superpower is that she can separate the task from the person. To this, end, Justice Ginsburg’s friendship with Justice Antonin Scalia has become legendary. They spent New Year’s Eve’s together and relished conversations about the opera, despite their diametrically opposed views on many issues. They were able to separate what conflict researchers called task versus relational conflict, a skill which leads to improved group performance when conflicts are kept in the task domain.

Not all of us can do this, and frankly, not all of us want to do this. As I write about in my book, there are both heat-based (more confrontational) and light-based (more educational) approaches to change, and many of us prefer one versus the other. Effective social change requires both. But for those who can and will, Justice Ginsburg would likely coach us to take advice she received from her mother-in-law – about being “a little deaf” at times. Her ability to compartmentalize away exactly that which she is working to change allows her to sustain her own energy and build alliances. For those in minority groups for whom this approach is amenable, Justice Ginsburg would likely coach us to keep teaching people.

Whether you are in or considering marriage, older than you used to be, or in a minority group, Justice Ginsburg’s example has much to offer about your life partner, your side hustle, and your approach to injustice.  Love or hate her views, there is much to be learned from her example.",None
"Since its founding about five years ago, Christopher Gray has focused his app Scholly on a mission: help college-bound students seeking financial aid assess the thousands of private scholarships offered by companies and other organizations and find the ones with the best fit. Now the LA-based enterprise is moving into the student debt arena by teaming up with Freeform, the television network behind the show Grown-ish. They're running a competition that will fund grants of up to $125,000 to help students and graduates pay off their outstanding loans.

Sit-com Grown-ish, now in its second season, focuses on the lives of college students. So a perfect tie-in for Scholly.

The process will happen in two phases. In the first, applicants merely visit a web site or the Scholly app, providing their name, loan amount, school and contact information. That step intentionally was made easy. “We want as many people as possible to apply,” says Gray. And in fact, within the first five hours of going live last week, more than 10,000 applicants signed up. The second step will involve a more-formal application, with essays to complete and other information.

Scholly is managing the application process and selecting the winners. Freeform is supplying the  funding.

According to Gray, the program is the beginning of a bigger focus on student loan debt. “Paying off student loans is more of a universal problem,” he says. Plus interest in the existing app shot up exponentially, according to Gray. Traffic in three hours equaled an average month’s worth of visits.

The son of a struggling single mother, Gray couldn't afford to attend college. So he went through the laborious process of researching and applying to private scholarships. The work paid off: He was awarded over $1 million in grants. Then, while enrolled at Drexel University, he realized he could use his experience to build a company aimed at helping students with everything from finding information about scholarships to managing deadlines. Recently, Gray added a platform with which users can check for style errors and get other editing help.

Gray moved the company to LA from Philadelphia a year and a half ago to be closer to influencers, like Chance the Rapper, and other high-profile endorsers. “We don’t need to pay for this,” he says. “People think Scholly is a  great thing to be associated with.” The traffic has skyrocketed since then, says Gray. The app has 3 million users and, according to Gray, has helped students garner about $100 million in scholarship funding.

Winners of the Grown-ish contest will be announced later this year.",None
"It's a terrible feeling when you lose your job. To make matters worse, it is awful to be discriminated against because you're out of work.

Government data touts that we have broken records of having the lowest level of  unemployment in decades. The statistics conveniently leave out those who have exhausted their unemployment claims and still haven't found a new job. These people, who need the most help, are conveniently ignored and treated as if they don't exist, especially since it ruins the narrative of full employment.

Society shies away from discussing the unemployed—and especially the long-term unemployed (someone who is out of work for 27 weeks or more). In December 2018, there were 1.3 million long-term unemployed individuals. Yet, it is still one of those touchy taboo subjects that we all feel could happen to us and would prefer to avoid talking about it.

Rationally, you’d believe that with full employment (and the accompanying challenge for companies to find qualified candidates), they would quickly scoop up anyone out of work. Sadly, this does not happen. There is a discrete, unspoken thought process amongst corporate executives that if someone is unemployed for a certain length of time, there must be a problem and they’d rather just pass on the candidate. An unrealistic expectation exists in which hiring managers feel that a person should have found a job within a reasonable time frame after being unemployed—and if they haven’t, something may be wrong with him. The bias against the unemployed is as common and pernicious as age discrimination.

One of the biggest challenges that happen to the long-term unemployed is that they tend to isolate themselves and withdraw from social and business settings. In our culture, people strongly identify themselves—and are judged by others—based on their job, career and earnings potential.  When a person loses her job and is out of the workforce for a certain amount of time, it can become mentally, emotionally and physically draining and sometimes even debilitating. The unemployed person is beset by worries, anxiety and fear. Understandably, they are concerned about their future, miss the social aspect of being in the office with other people and feel a loss of self-worth.

They have legitimate worries about paying their mortgage and children's college tuition, burning through all their hard-earned savings, the possibility of having to sell their home and an uncertain future.

One obstacle that the long-term unemployed face is when interviewers use excuses not to hire like, “Let’s find someone else who is more up to date. We need a person who has job stability with an upward trajectory”. With long-term unemployment, the discrimination is out in the open. Hiring managers will blatantly ask, “Why didn’t someone pick this guy up by now?” It’s the same mindset if you are dating and meet an eligible person in their late 30s or 40s that hasn’t been married and is still single.  If the person is attractive, polite and seemingly wealthy, they’ll inquire, “What’s wrong with him? There has to be a catch.”

Also, to keep with the dating reference, people tend to want what someone else has. If he has a girlfriend, then he is more enticing. If he is single, what’s wrong? And so it goes with hiring. If she is working at a prestigious firm, then she is highly desirable. If she is unemployed for a length of time, we are not interested.

When asked about your employment status during the interview process, the best thing to do is have a candid, concise and prepared message about what happened. Don’t feel guilty about anything. You want to convey confidence and assuredness to combat their possible prejudices. You may want to remind them that if you are hired, there is no worry about a counteroffer; nor do you have to wait for a bonus. This is highly attractive for this time of year.

If there was a problem, openly discuss it, but do your best to put a positive spin on what transpired. You could acknowledge your mistake, let them know that you have learned from it and that you will be a better person and employee because of the lesson learned.

While you are searching for a job, try to make sure that you are engaged in activities. Hiring managers don’t want to hear that you are just sitting at home and sending out résumés. You want to be prepared to offer something when the interviewer asks what you’ve been doing. If it's nothing, this will confirm their bias. I would suggest that you take on some volunteer work, do some consulting, take additional higher education classes or attend conferences. Go out and connect with people. Make sure you stay relevant in people’s minds. Networking could position you to pick up on leads about different job opportunities.

You want to keep mentally, physically and emotionally engaged. The worst thing you can do is sit home and brood over your bad luck. It’s easy to become a recluse. I strongly suggest enacting a daily schedule as if you are still working. Wake up early, go for a jog, go to the gym and eat right. Do things to stimulate your mind and spirit. Be regimented by keeping your mental, emotional and physical health in check.

Long-term unemployment may pose a challenge, but you will overcome the hurdles. It is important to remain confident, continue searching for a new job in a disciplined manner and remember that you are not alone. In my experience, I have seen many people bounce back after being unemployed for a long period—and find even better jobs with more money and greater growth potential.",None
"Being good is good for business. If you do things well, do them better. Be daring, be first, be different, be just' (Anita Roddick, Founder of The Body Shop)

The concept of working human and bringing more humanity and social connection to the employees' experience continues to gain momentum with forward-thinking business managers. According to a study conducted by Globoforce, employees are looking for meaning, value-based recognition, and positive manager-employee relationship. It is clear. Time for bosses is gone. The era of leaders has arisen.

Exceptional leaders care about their crew. They invest effort in creating healthy emotional connections with others and making a positive contribution at all levels. Striking the right interpersonal chord with your staff is crucial for both managers and employees' fulfillment. However, managing the rights doses of friendliness and overall business and outcomes responsibility is not a simple thing. You want your employees to enjoy what they do but also to deliver. You want your employees to like you but also respect you. A successful team needs a confident leader, not a friend. So how can we then draw the healthy line between leadership and buddyness?

According to the Gallup study, How Millennials Want to Work and Live, new workforce generations do not want bosses but coaches. Millennials will feel valued and cared about with managers that help them to understand and build on their strengths.

The trap of wanting to be liked is quite usual but requires to be suppressed to reach real caring. Caring is very different from wanting to be liked. Caring is non-conditional and applies to every employee. Caring will ensure that leaders are able to course-correct employees humanly for the good of them, the team and the company and without letting personal concerns get in the way.

Getting to know your employees on a personal level, while not getting too personal is a great way to show them that you generally care about them as people and not just as employees. Rather than focus on their individual tastes or needs, get interested in things inside their different circles of influence. Knowing about your employees' kids graduation, a family funeral or the anniversary date when they joined the company are successful ways to show humanity that will not interfere in the in the seriousness of your professional relationship.

Asserting your role as a leader requires to make clear decisions consistently and communicate them effectively. You need to be open to all ideas, but sometimes it needs to be clear that you will make the final decision. This is part of the job. But getting into the decision-making process with a win-win approach will help you to keep your team always satisfied. It is not about making deals or letting things go in a way they should not. It is about clearly communicating your choices. Explaining to your employees the reasoning and goodwill behind your decisions will move them to support you as a leader even when going through the storm.

As much as flexibility and humanity, authority and clear frameworks are vital for success in any proactive workplace. Being too friendly or getting personally too close to your employees could eventually jeopardize your authority. The best way to ensure that your role is well respected and understood is to really take ownership and responsibility for your team. With fair and self-sacrificing leaders, employees get to experience a state of wellbeing that makes them feel more loyal and committed to their leader and the organization.

One of Gallup's study most important discoveries is that for the new workforce generations,  a job is no longer just a job―it's their life as well. More so than ever in the history of corporate culture, employees are asking, ""Does this organization value my strengths and my contribution? Does this organization give me the chance to do what I do best every day?"" New generations do not care about the bells and whistles found in many workplaces today. They do not need ping-pong tables to increase their level of satisfaction. What they want is a purpose and the possibility of holistic development.

Once they are fully developing their potential through their work, employees need to feel that their wellbeing is respected. Delaying half an hour their arrival working time to put kids at school, providing them with a special chair adjusted to their back problems, always respecting their working hours and rewarding any extra work or particular input are straightforward ways to make them feel that you genuinely care about their wellbeing and the wellbeing of those around them.

Listen to them. Start easy without procrastinating. Let them get motivated by giving them the space to develop their own ideas. Work on their strengths. Help them to grow their leadership skills. Make them feel valued. People that are praise on a regular basis for what they do well are much more prone to accept constructive critic when needed without feeling hurt. Make of your workplace an island ruled by peace and harmony. Where everybody has an important role. Where they all row together against the cliff in the middle of the storm. Where they follow you because is on their own benefit.

Trusting your employees is always the right choice. Just by trusting your team and giving them full responsibility for their job you can actually empower them. Trust always work. Well to define a team fully working independently and productively by entrusting autonomous and responsible individuals; well to get rid of those ones that are not responding proactively and honestly to this trust!",communication
"I did a piece yesterday on the disturbing though not surprising rise of workplace stress. So I hope this one is sort of an antidote to that - practical tips to help keep the hounds of stress at bay.

Managers cause a lot of stress, but the reality is they feel a lot of it too. As a longtime manager, who managed a lot of managers, and knew a lot of managers, I can attest to that. We sometimes think management is easy, but managers get pressures from all sides: from above (their own boss, plus perhaps higher layers too, more worse still); from below (their employees, many of whom, being human, can be quite difficult); from the side (their peers, who at times can be contentious and rivalrous). Not to mention the basic fact that in management you're also responsible for the livelihoods of others, a weight many take very seriously.

That said, there are steps anyone, manager and employee, can take to mitigate stress. Here are four of them.

Exercise. OK, this is a personal one, but for sure it's widely used. My favorite by far. I was fortunate to work for many years for a company with an excellent on-site fitness center. So I went at lunch, schedule permitting, at least three days a week to run. Nothing too ambitious, around three miles, in time to get back and eat a peanut butter sandwich at my desk. I always felt better for it (the running more than the peanut butter). Point being, whatever your exercise preference, if you're fortunate enough to have or be near a gym, use it. Great natural way to de-stress.

Understand your stressors. The more you know and can understand what your stress triggers are - what's causing it - the better equipped you are to deal with it. Knowledge as they say is power. What is it that makes you most stressed? A person, a task, a deadline, a job you can't quite master? It's worth taking the time to isolate and identify the roots here. Knowing is the beginning of coping.

Recharge when you need to. Burnout is real. IMHO, one of the craziest trends of our time is the demise of vacations, and the guilt associated with them. I did a piece last year (Why America Has Become The No-Vacation Nation) on a vacation study that showed 47% of people in the U.S. don't use all of their vacation time... and it quickly attracted over 70,000 readers. Touched a chord, I suspect. Doesn't make any sense. You need time to recharge the psychic batteries, whether for only a day or a half-day now and then... or of course an actual, proper vacation when the time comes. I'd often take afternoons off in the summer (work flow permitting of course) to go fly fishing on the Swift River in Western Massachusetts. Totally enjoyed those half-days. Would look forward to them all week - they made a lot of difference.

Look hard for perspective. Last but not least. Try hard to gain perspective, as best you can, on the sources of stress. Sometimes they can actually be pretty small. Chances are, if it's a work-related issue, no one's hurt or dying, and things will pass in time. Sure, sometimes problems are big and intractable, but oftentimes they're not quite as big as we make them. Anyway, it's worth a try. Perspective is seldom a bad thing.

Stress may be on the rise, but that doesn't mean it has to control you - these practical steps may help you control it.",None
"So, you think you're acing your job interview.

Your interviewer seems to like you. You like your job interviewer. The camaraderie couldn't be better.

Then comes the proverbial: ""So, what questions do you have for me?""

Whether you're interviewing for a job at Google or joining your local small business, the questions that you ask your interviewer matter. It's your opportunity to showcase your talents, knowledge, and judgment.

Here are 5 questions that you should never ask during a job interview (and three more that you should).

1. ""So, how much will I get paid?""

This seems like a no-brainer, but for some reason, interviewees still think the question is fair play.

That said, it is a fair question. After all, you need to know how much you'll be paid before you take the job. While that's true, the interview is not the time to discuss salary.

If you receive a job offer, you can discuss salary at that time.

2. ""How much vacation time will I get?""

Again, your vacation and personal time might be an important part of your calculus when deciding to take a job offer.

However, asking how much vacation time you'll get demonstrates you're focused more on time off than working.

Like salary, your vacation and other benefits should be reflected in the job offer. You can ask all the questions related to salary and benefits at that time. You can also schedule a follow-up session with the human resources department for a benefits deep-dive.

3. ""How quickly can I get promoted?""

Climbing the ladder of your potentially new organization is admirable.

However, don't assume during the interview that you have the job. It's important to understand options for movement - both upward and lateral - within the organization. If you plan to work at this organization, it's essential to understand your career trajectory.

You don't want to come off as entitled. This question may convey to the interviewer that you think you already have the job (when you don't).

4. ""Why did the company fire so many people last month?""

It's never a good sign to read about layoffs.

This is especially true when you may be joining an organization after a big headcount reduction.

It's a fair question, and you should understand the details. However, the job interview is the wrong time.

When you receive your job offer, you can have a frank conversation with your manager about the layoffs, the rationale, whether additional layoffs are expected and other related information to fortify your understanding.

Before accepting a job, make sure to understand if the headcount reduction is expected to be ongoing or if it was a one-time occurrence.

5. ""So, who do you consider your competition?""

Instead of asking your interviewer about the competition, spend the time asking questions that demonstrate your interest in the company and also show that you've done research prior to your interview.

Before the interview, you should have conducted due diligence on the competitive landscape.

That includes understanding key competitors, relative strengths and weaknesses, the supply chain, key opportunities and threats, barriers to entry and other pertinent market dynamics.

You're better off weaving this information into the interview, rather than asking during the question period.

3 Questions That You Can Ask During An Interview

Here are three potential questions that you could ask during your job interview:

1. ""What are the best attributes of the company's culture?""

2. ""How much is collaboration across departments encouraged?""

3. ""What would you like the person that you hire to accomplish over the next 6-12 months?""",None
"Remember a few years back when everybody (and I mean everybody) was trying to “gamify” their learning content? In this hyperconnected, short-attention-span world of ours, gamification was seen as a powerful new way to engage learners: If you can lure them into a game-like environment where content combines with competition, you can overcome today’s culture of distraction. Or at least that was the theory.

Business-to-business (B2B) advisory firm SiriusDecisions conducted a study focused on sales talent called ""Sales Enablement for the First-Line Sales Manager."" (I am a former analyst for SiriusDecisions.) As part of the study, the firm says it asked sales professionals how they prefer to learn. Somewhat surprisingly, gamification and podcasts brought up the rear. SiriusDecisions reported that the ways they did want to learn were what you would traditionally expect: ""on-the-job informal learning,"" ""in-field observation of others,"" and ""collaboration with peers.""

Does this mean it’s game over for gamification? Not entirely. (At my sales enablement solutions company, we have seen many clients achieve success through a balanced use of gamification.) But it does mean that gamification, like many new tools, has transitioned away from “shiny-new-object” status and settled into its rightful place in the learning toolbox: as a tactic that has merit in the right situations. The danger I see is in overestimating the impact gamification will have on learners and over-relying on it as a sales readiness strategy.

Why were people so excited about gamification in the first place? Because it seemed like a way to get learners (particularly millennials raised on apps and gamification) engaged in learning content by stirring their competitive spirit. For sales reps, this would seem to be the perfect combination of qualities: We want them to engage with learning content, and we definitely want them to be competitive.

However, engaging and learning are two different things. Most of us had teachers in school who were funny, engaging and really easy graders (the proverbial “gut” class), but we may have learned more from the hard-as-nails old-timer who had encyclopedic knowledge and held students to a high standard. If the goal is to get students to show up in the classroom, then the first teacher is likely the most effective. But if the goal is to have them actually learn something, then the second teacher may be superior.

And this is exactly the issue with gamification. The best sales reps are often curious learners — they don’t need games to engage with learning content. They are already hungry to learn because they want to close more deals and earn more money. In my experience, the best way to enable these learners is to give them information they can use as efficiently as possible. Gamification can be a useful subcomponent to learning (including to get lower-performing reps engaged as part of their evolution as learners), but it should not be a foundational element.

Ironically, sales may be the originator of corporate gamification with the long-standing “sales deal leaderboard.” Leaderboards can also be helpful “in the moment” to motivate sales reps to keep up with their training and coaching activities (i.e., “That ‘A’ player already passed his assessment; I’d better get going!”). But, at the end of the day, revenue is what matters most. In other words, no rep wants to be first on the learning leaderboard and last on the revenue one.

Because top sales reps tend to be naturally curious learners, sales enablement leaders should seek to harness this energy to create a culture of learning in their organizations. There could be elements of gamification in this — such as conducting quizzes with prizes. But for the most part, I believe consuming and operationalizing learning content should be simply “part of the job” for sales reps. This is the approach top performers tend to take — so it should be what everyone strives to do.

• Working with the chief sales officer to make it clear to every rep that learning is part of their job. A rep who stops learning will eventually stop providing value to buyers. Keeping up on the latest products and competitive intel, and continuously improving their craft, should be part of every rep’s job description.

• Enlisting peers to create content and evangelize the importance of readiness. I've noticed reps are much more likely to consume case studies, videos and other learning materials authored by peers rather than by unknown writers.

• Implementing accountability for learning materials. For example, random quizzes during sales meetings on the “top three things” reps learned in the most recent newsletter or webcast could make them pay attention to content.

• Enlisting managers in training, because reps may be far more likely to be “model students” when their manager is leading the class. Managers could conduct mini-workshops at sales meetings, or they could have reps produce videos of themselves pitching the latest product — and the managers could then review the videos and provide feedback.

All of this takes us back to our original question: Is it game over for gamification? Not really — but like many “hot” new approaches to learning, I believe gamification falls short of the hype. It has its place within a learning culture — contests and competitions are great ways to focus sales reps on specific goals that they care about and to whet their appetites for more learning. However, rather than fixating on gamification, it could be far more productive for sales leaders and enablement professionals to focus on implementing a broad-based culture of learning. This is a critical step toward achieving the ultimate goal: creating a state of perpetual readiness among sales reps.",None
"The recruiting industry has an open secret: Most companies have no idea how to attract the best candidates to join their organization. To pull back the lid on this sad truth, here are the three simple reasons why most organizations fail to attract top talent.

1. They Don’t Know What They Are Looking For

HR professionals are busy people for whom talent recruiting is just one task in an enormous mound of competing priorities. Recruiting doesn’t typically rise to the top of the pile until there is an urgent need, like an imminent staff opening. When this occurs, the company needs to create a job description and post the position, stat. So, what do most professionals do? They simply Google a generic job description and copy and paste it into their job ad.

But this approach is ineffective and problematic, because:

• It is unlikely you will find an exact match to your company’s needs for the role because a description created by another organization cannot precisely describe the responsibilities of the position at your company.

• Have you ever played the game Telephone? The game is so fun to play because the last person in line hears an utterly different message from what the first person intended. Googling a job description works the same way. It’s likely that any description you find online was copied repeatedly until it is a watered-down version with little practical use in any real-world corporate environment, let alone in your unique organization.

• You’re essentially recruiting for someone qualified to perform a job at another company. The good news is, when that individual eventually fails in your organization, you can always refer them to the other firm!

To create an effective job description, you must begin close to home by focusing on your organization’s needs. Research the specific tasks, functions and responsibilities of the current position. Interview top performers in the role and their supervisors. Then identify their common traits and qualifications and craft the job description based on that ideal. Remember, a job description should actually describe the job that needs to be done.

Most recruiters who advertise on job boards assume the candidates available represent the entire talent stack. To them, the stack represents a scale, where the best-qualified candidates are 10s and the least-qualified candidates are 1s. However, this assumption that job boards include the entire universe of employee quality is naïve and dangerous. The reality looks much different.

The truth is that 80% of the job board talent pool is at the low end of the scale — primarily 2s to 4s, with a few 5s and 6s sprinkled in. Why? Because the better-quality candidates don’t need to use job boards. Most already hold satisfying positions and aren’t actively looking for new employment.

Toss aside this assumption and look around your own organization at the small handful of people who are ""rock star"" employees. Note their special qualities and qualifications, design an avatar of your ideal candidate, then go find the rock stars among your competitors.

When it comes right down to it, recruiting is just not a priority at most organizations. It is viewed as a reactive versus proactive exercise. Most organizations don’t even begin searching for and identifying talent until they have a vacant position they need to fill immediately.

The best thing you can do is turn this mindset on its head. Advocate for long-term, strategic recruiting and educate your peers in senior leadership on the tremendous value a proactive approach can bring to your organization.

Truth is, you only need 20 minutes a day, focused on targeted, meaningful actions. Begin by taking these steps for each key role in your company:

• Describe the job that needs to be done.

• Identify the qualities of your ideal candidate.

• Identify the people in those roles at your competitors'.

• Reach out and establish relationships with those people over time.

Broken into manageable daily chunks, you will make real, meaningful progress very quickly.

What many organizations fail to understand is that recruiting is a long game. To succeed, you must fully understand the requirements of the positions you are trying to fill, look beyond the obvious candidates and make the talent search a priority.  Remember, the human element is the biggest competitive advantage for most companies -- treat it as such.

Spend just 20 minutes a day, every day on the right tasks and you will begin to see results!",None
"As you focus on bettering aspects of your life (fitness, nutrition, etc.) for the new year, why not improve your digital self or online brand as well? As personal branding expert Natasa Djukanovic explains, ""In a digital age where you can find out a lot about a person from just a Google search and a few clicks, it's important to make sure you're portraying an online presence you are proud of.""

Now more than ever, your digital brand matters. From employers to potential clients, people are looking to online channels to make informed decisions about you. he shift to digital is here to stay.  So whether it's a few small tweaks or an entire brand overhaul, make revamping your digital persona part of your New Year's resolutions. Here's what to consider:

As with all other New Year's resolutions, your road to building a strong online persona should start by accepting who you are. The greatest challenge people face is deciding what to focus on, what to write about, whether they are thinking about making a personal website or aligning their social media posts with their “new” brand. ""If the task sounds daunting and you are not sure how to approach it, start with some self-reflection"" suggests Natasa. Write down everything you’ve achieved so far and if that doesn't apply to you yet, focus on the things you are passionate about.

Get inspired by people you admire to start creating your own brand, especially by those in your industry. As you look within and figure things out about yourself, they can give you some ideas to take action. 2. Show what you bring to the table.  No matter what stage of career you're in, do not doubt that you have a lot to offer. As such, do not be afraid to share your work and anything you're proud of online. Talk about it and engage with people who express an interest. Make sure your personal website and social media channels reflect your value while also showcasing your personality, including your beliefs and passions. This brings us to our next point.

Start by sharing relevant news articles and interesting perspectives within your area of expertise. Take it a step further and start creating your own content. Write a blog post that discusses an experience you had or something you learned. Jump on existing conversations with something to contribute. Doing this will make you stand out and you will be perceived as an authority in your field

Do not be afraid to reach out to people you want to connect with. Take a proactive approach and go to the people you would like to build a relationship with. You may hear stories of people getting contacted by LinkedIn recruiters and being hired on the spot, but more often than not, some prior work is needed on their part to be in this position where people come to them. People you connect and interact with online are also part of your network. It’s through these meaningful connections that you are able to grow and make your personal brand even stronger.",None
"What do Mark Cuban, Jillian Michaels, and YouTube star iJustine have in common? They're all part of Amazon's influencer program, according to a new Business Insider report that came out on Thursday.

People with significant social media followings get commissions on the links they post if they have a ""qualifying YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, or Facebook account,"" according to the program's webpage.

In retrospect, it shouldn't be a surprise, what with $500,000 premium product pages, the merchandising hoopla that is Prime Day, and the company's massive affiliate program. Amazon markets extensive and, usually, effectively. It seems to be doing the latter.

TechCrunch reported on Amazon's beta test of the influencer program in 2017. But, given some of the names it's attracted, influencers have been an important promotional outlet.

According to the deal terms report that Business Insider obtained, commissions run anywhere from 1 percent to 10 percent, with the highest amounts for Amazon's private fashion line, which makes sense. Margins should be higher on private label goods, as will the benefit to the company of getting higher market share for its items. Influencers get their own storefronts on Amazon. For example, Cuban's page features a couple of his books as well as products from companies he's invested in.

Aside from the bigger names, the program has reportedly also targeted ""microinfluencers,"" with anywhere from a few hundred to a few thousand followers but who might have stronger connections. Reportedly, ""thousands"" of such people have been signed up.

""There's people that make $100 a day -- it's just for side money, it's not something to get rich off,"" said Samuel Torres, an influencer who is in the program, to Business Insider. Side money being an extra $36,500 annually at that rate. And some apparently make much more.

Influencers can also make money promoting services like Amazon Prime, Audible, and Amazon Fresh. Reportedly, a successful Amazon Business referral is worth $15, while an Audible or Fresh signup pays the influencer $5.

What makes the approach particularly interesting is that it neatly sidesteps one of the big problems with other influencer programs. There have been many cases of influencers renting fake followers and then charging higher sums for mentioning a product.

Amazon's approach undercuts any of that potential downside. Unlike other influencer marketing, the company isn't paying people to deliver a message. They have to bring in paying customers. Only then do they get the commission. Influencers only get paid to the degree that Amazon sees revenue.

One final note. Hopefully we've all learned over the past few years that you have to be up front in social media promotions. If not, it could become something the Federal Trade Commission could get involved with.",None
"I've been in leadership positions long enough to know no one hands you a leadership manual (unless you're in the Army). Common blind spots can derail a leader's career, self-awareness is a never-ending quest, and figuring out what makes employees tick can be puzzling.

1. 78 percent of employees don't believe their leaders have a clear direction for the organization.

What's going on here? First, too many leaders develop their vision in a vacuum. They don't enroll the broader organization in the vision along the way, opting instead to come down from the mountain with the vision written on a tablet. People need to weigh in before they can buy in.

And the written-in-stone part is problematic too, because visions need to be more flexible and adjustable because of marketplace realities that might arise. Visions also need to be built on company and employee strengths (not just based on a future state that assumes all disadvantages have disintegrated). Finally, visions have to be communicated repeatedly. Lack of clarity in direction may simply be due to a lack of leaders reinforcing it over time.

2. 74 percent of employees don't believe their organization delivers on promises to customers.

Companies that delight customers fully enroll and empower employees to act in the customer's best interest at all times. At places like the Waldorf Astoria, Nordstrom, and even Chick-fil-A, employees are rewarded and recognized for staying close to what customers want and acting on it.

You can never be too close to your customer, something that depends on positive word of mouth and referrals. What if you acted as if 100 percent of your business came from referrals?

3. 88 percent of employees think their company mishandled their onboarding.

Most companies treat onboardings as paperwork, processing, and providing Post-it notes. The Gallup research (and my own experience) indicates onboarding should include giving the new employee a chance to experience your company's unique culture and to spend some time with key leaders. It should garner an understanding of how their work fits into the bigger picture and an appreciation for why their work matters. And it should help them be able to picture a long-term career path.

4. 86 percent of employees don't think their performance review inspired them to improve.

This is an easy one to miss, as many leaders naturally think reviews are about reviewing, ranking, and rating--when they can be so much more. In Make It Matter, I share that performance reviews are excellent opportunities to imbue an employee's work plan with more meaning. Instead of just reviewing the numbers, strengths, and weaknesses, consider discussing these kinds of questions with employees:

Ternio, a technology firm specializing in blockchain, has introduced BlockCard, a debit card that enables the account holder to spend their cryptocurrency as though it were dollars. The company says it can be used online or at point-of-sale locations in brick and mortar retail locations, as long as the business accepts credit cards. [Consumer Affairs]",None
"The fight for gender equality in the workplace has come a long way in recent decades, but in many industries and corporate cultures, men are still a step ahead. Women often feel the need to prove themselves as serious professionals and leaders to their male counterparts.

Women can and do actively advocate for themselves in the workplace, but unless men participate, too, real change will be difficult to achieve. According to nine members of Young Entrepreneur Council, here's what men can do to better support the female leaders in their organization.

Balancing men and women in leadership roles provides checks and balances and a wider lens to see through. The male and female brain think very differently, and different thoughts create different information. Men can support women in leadership roles by opening their minds to the possibilities and advantages of a truly balanced leadership team. — Hillary Hobson, Highest Cash Offer

Men can support women by insisting on women’s rights and taking paternity leave, thereby leveling the playing field that penalizes women when they take maternity leave. — Rachel Beider, Massage Outpost

Are there ways in which you're part of the problem? Do you have explicit biases that need to be addressed? Lack of exposure to diverse perspectives? Finding ways to connect with all types of women is a great way to gain a better understanding of our talents. Then, you can make changes in the way you treat women or foster cultures that hold us back. — Amber Anderson, Tote + Pears

Encouraging female employees to self-nominate, and making sure they are given the same opportunities at work as male colleagues is a great start. This may mean examining how networking and even social events are held at your company, but it will make the whole team stronger! — Lizzy Jane Newsome Yopp, Kappa Toys

I wish more men would offer genuine support with pure intentions — as if we were their sister, who they are rooting for. Look out for us, have our backs, encourage us, support our efforts, and be there when we need to bounce something off you. In short, just authentically be in our corner. — Jackie Ducci, Ducci & Associates

Invite women to the table and be willing to listen. Invest in women; your time, your money, and your network. Provide a safe space to open the dialogue of what is needed. — Jess Moseley, TCS Interpreting

Be encouraging. Men should never put limitations on women's abilities. A strong man encourages and supports the women around him. A man should remind a woman that she is capable of accomplishing anything she sets her mind to and that the only thing holding her back is herself. — Taylor Irwin, Rocky Mountain Car Wash

Be more actively mindful. Is there a capable woman who can do that role you’re seeking? Let her know. Is there an important meeting or gathering that is missing female representation? Send the invitation. Men in meetings can sometimes talk over women more than they do with other men. Watch for this. — Pokin Yeung, Absolute Games

Men can guide women by offering constructive feedback. They can encourage women by showing respect and enthusiasm. They can trust women by stepping aside and allowing them to lead. — Dalia MacPhee, DALIA MACPHEE",None
"2018 is a wrap. The holiday season is a wrap. Are you sure your plan for 2019 is a wrap?

Sorry to be a buzzkill, but if you want your organization to succeed this year, there are six key blind spots leaders must address.

As you know from my past blogs, the human brain has the tendency to delete (choose to deem something as unimportant or less important, so to ignore it), distort (blow things out of proportion, or hyper-focus on a small set of items) and generalize (assume things will continue as usual or are predictable). What are you deleting? Distorting? Generalizing?

Bet it’s something important—like one of the six topics below that you really need to think about. And it’s something all of my executive coaching clients are thinking about.

So without further ado, here’s what you’ll be really, really glad you thought about before diving into the remainder of 2019.

Gallup's workplace research has supported the six topics we’re concerned about, so thanks to them for the statistics.

In our leadership acceleration workshops, I often poll the participants on their emotional state. The #1 response I get is “overwhelmed."" Per Gallup, employees who are often burned out are 63% more likely to take a sick day and 23% more likely to visit the emergency room.

Burnout occurs from a few factors: excessive workload (a leadership and communication problem), changing or unclear directives (a leadership, communication, and emotional problem) and low emotional resilience. With greater communication we can tell our leaders we’re overloaded or need more clear direction. With greater emotional resilience we can navigate our emotions with greater choice and power.

Take our emotional resilience assessment here and see how you’re doing.

How’s your communication going? Does everyone, throughout the organization, fully understand where the firm is going, why, what it means to the business and them personally, and how you’re going to get there? The research from Gallup tells us the answer is a big no. And only 15% of employees strongly agree the leadership of their organization makes them feel enthusiastic about the future. Uh oh.

In my executive coaching work, I often help leaders to ensure they include more people in the process of visioning, planning, and communicating. We need to help others have and contribute insights into the process as well. Being engaged in the process equals being engaged in the outcome.

Take our leadership experience assessment and to check on the clarity of your vision is.

We have an integrity problem, it appears. Or maybe we’ll get lucky and it will be downgraded to a misunderstanding… but I don’t think so. Are your promises to your customers abundantly clear--written down and clearly communicated in policies and procedures? Because there’s a disconnect happening somewhere.

The employee experience powerfully informs the customer experience, as I proved in this blog. We don’t have the luxury of our teams not trusting us—since this is the case, it’s time to up our leadership game here.

If you’re still doing traditional annual reviews then we need to talk. Performance Management is out, performance motivation, where an employee actively participates in their reviews and development, is in. Per Gallup, fewer than three in 10 employees believe their performance reviews are fair and accurate.

One possible reason is that performance conversations, even just basic feedback, occur rarely. We could easily blame this on the pace of modern business, but in my executive coaching work, I find all too often the issue is conflict avoidance.

Onboarding, as most of us know, is often done ineffectively. And as an executive coach, I find the culprit is that the process begins entirely too late. Which is why most employees are not happy with the experience .

A great onboarding program launches the emotional experience of engagement immediately, and this begins with the job posting. This is where we start to onboard a candidate emotionally—so don’t miss this opportunity! It then provides a rich and fulfilling experience all the way through the recruiting process and into the first year.

Whoa. Half of the team is looking for a better gig. That’s not good, and probably the first five factors above have led to these. To make matters worse,  nearly half (47%) say now is a good time to find a quality job .

Working just for a paycheck is long gone. Workers want to be developed, want to be connected, engaged and want communication. Workers today want their basic dignity to be honored.

How are you doing on the above? Where will you focus in 2019?

"You walked out of the interview feeling like you killed it, only to find out days later that the company decided to go with another candidate. You knew before you even walked into the interview that you had the right skills, experiences and qualifications to do the job, so what went wrong?

Before you start frantically fixing your resume and questioning your self-worth, pause for a moment. There are five types of interviewers who struggle to get the job offer they truly want, and you may fall in one of these categories without even realizing it.

You may be applying for the wrong jobs. Yes, you may have the right skills, qualifications and experiences but you may have too many of them. If you’re getting interviews for roles that require 2 years of experience and you have 4 years, this applies to you. While your interview may have been great, you could have been rejected because the hiring manager didn’t think you’d be fulfilled in the role, knew you wouldn’t be satisfied with slow career growth, or knew they couldn’t afford to pay you the salary you deserve.

If you’re applying to any and every position you’re qualified for, and hoping to just get in where you fit in, hiring managers are probably smelling your desperation as soon as you walk in the door. It’s giving off red flags that you’d be willing to take anything and that you’re not completely interested in them. First, stop applying to every position that flashes across your computer screen. Then, ditch the eager beaver act and focus on displaying confidence and value in your interviews.

You might struggle with answering question directly. If you’re always going on tangents, telling unnecessary stories, and including irrelevant details, you’re missing opportunity after opportunity to demonstrate why you’d be a perfect fit for the position. If you struggle with rambling, you aren’t 100% clear on why you’re the best fit for the role you desire. For next time, get clear on how to concisely show that you understand their needs, can solve their problems and can fit right in with the team’s culture.

You might be a tad over-confident. You might struggle with this if you’re constantly saying, “I just need to get my foot in the door. If I can just get an interview, I’ll be good.”

If you assume that just knowing you’re qualified and that you’d love to work at the company are enough to woo the hiring manager, then you’re not doing enough. By not going the extra mile to prepare for interviews, you fail to truly stand out. Instead of winging it, do your research and identify the specific strengths, qualities and experiences that make you beneficial to the team and company.

You might have been a close second in the interview process. You likely fall into this category if you tend to make it through several rounds of interviews and usually can’t think of any major mistakes. But to hiring managers, you’re missing something even if they can’t put their finger on it. The almost perfect candidate is good but not great – at least, in their eyes.

While things do happen that are out of your control, you may have find yourself in this predicament if you lacked enthusiasm or passion for the role or company. If you tend to focus too much on the technical side of things and forget to reveal your personality, values and similarities, the hiring manager could assume you’re amazing but not a good cultural fit. People like to work with people they like, so take the time to figure out exactly why you see yourself working well with the team and don’t be afraid to convey those qualities. Let your hair down – in the most professional way possible, of course.

The hiring process can be slippery and sometimes, no matter what you do, certain opportunities are just not meant for you. But, there’s no reason to miss out on a position you really want because you failed to clearly demonstrate your value. So, if you’re struggling in one of these areas, get clear on how you’re missing the mark so that you can finally secure a role you’ll love.",None
"My grandfather was a bit of a magician. He performed tricks with a deck of cards, and my favorite involved a box made of wood that was painted solid black. He’d put a face card into a slot on one side of the box and pull a lever. Out of the other side would appear a card, but it was blank; it had no suit or number. He would then put the blank card into the black box, and out would pop the original card. As a five-year-old, I was awed.

The idea of a black box has always stuck with me. By definition, a black box is a system or object that is viewed in terms of its inputs and outputs, while its internal workings remain a mystery. For many years, I was the vice president of training in large financial institutions. I interviewed each candidate to determine how much they knew and how much they’d have to learn. I mentally associated each of them with a clear box, black box or some shade of gray. My goal was to help them reach black-box status, which meant they were ready to work independently.

Understanding where your employees land is important.

When an employee obtains black-box status, they receive a task and disappear to do their work. When they return, they bring with them an assignment that is completed at high levels of professionalism, quality and appropriateness. That is, their work solves a problem or provides a highly workable solution to a situation. Employees at black-box status are capable of performing at high levels independently. Their work is complete.

I believe obtaining black-box status has multiple rewards. First, leaders can concentrate on their work knowing the people who attained black-box status were concentrating on theirs. It also means you have time to look for creative solutions to problems and help other team members attain black-box status.

Employees at a clear-box status, on the other hand, are not ready to submit completed work on their own. Their work is observed and guided. A significant amount of time is spent providing direction, coaching, training and mentoring.

Those who have experience in their field might not have ""boxes"" clear as glass, but if they are new to an organization, they will still need to learn the ropes. As a manager, it is your responsibility to help them acquire new knowledge and skills in order to succeed in their new environment.

A black-box philosophy can help prepare employees for advancement.

I believe the goal of managers is to gradually darken the boxes of their employees so they understand the organization, its values and expectations. This way, they are fully capable of making wise, independent decisions. The box-darkening process (training, coaching and mentoring) takes some effort, but the effort pays dividends in the long run because as an employee’s box darkens, less time is needed to assist them. Eventually, they, too, will be capable of assisting new, clear-box employees.

When a person’s box is 100% black, they are independent. They’ve met with others, discussed options and presented carefully crafted and high-quality solutions. But high-quality solutions are only one part of an employee's output.

Another important output is innovative ideas. A black-box-level employee should be able to look at situations and processes and automatically begin the process of determining how they can be better or what makes them good. Extrapolating what works well and applying that to other situations is a signal that someone is ready for advancement.

I was recently asked: “How do you teach your employees to think independently?” I’d ask them to come to me with ideas, not questions. The more they tried out these ideas, the better they got. There were, of course, some failures. But we did our best to learn from them and not repeat them.

Being a black-box manager has its own advantages and disadvantages.

If you apply the black-box metaphor, I believe your job has three functions:

1. Look for ways to improve. Expand your focus from only the skills of your employees to the ways you can improve the effectiveness of your organization.

2. Assist team members in a manner that best addresses the situations they face. Let your team discuss any concerns they might have. Ask how they intend to deal with them, and offer ideas that open their minds to new possibilities.

3. Help others reach black-box status. Provide interesting challenges that are good fits for the interests and skills of each employee, and encourage them to face the challenges themselves (but with the knowledge that you are there to support them if necessary).

Once your team has reached black-box level, it's possible that some might move to other teams for more advanced opportunities. Losing great employees can be difficult, but I believe it’s more rewarding to see them advance and succeed. Don't think of someone leaving as a loss, but rather as another helpful friend in the organization.

Applying this concept of clear and black boxes to your team can help them learn to be extremely productive without needing your total involvement. As a result, I believe you'll be able to better focus on the future of your company and better assess the capabilities of your team.",None
"These are turbulent times. The news cycle is too fast. Climate change is wreaking havoc with fires, floods, and droughts. Rising inequality and political unrest have brought polarization and violence. Technology is disruptive and markets are volatile. How do you lead through such acceleration and uncertainty?

""The metrics show that the average tenure on any index for a company is much shorter than it was 50 years ago and much shorter than it was 100 years ago,"" says Coulter, ""and CEO tenures are also shrinking. The world is going through all kinds of change; so much is happening. If a company is truly committed to being around for the next 100 years then it has to think differently and act differently. To do that strategically, sustainability becomes the ideal framework.""

""The 'All In' part of the book's title means that because of all kinds of challenges and opportunities, it becomes irresistible to not take a half-hearted approach to sustainability but to dive in with both feet - because this is how you can future-fit your business,"" says Coulter. ""When you're sort of a little bit in, you don't catalyze your employees well enough, you don't get the attraction of talent, you don't become more influential in regulatory circles or the ideal partner of choice; you also don't get any sort of halo related to market share of customers - because you're just status quo and you're not purposeful.""

The book uses information from extensive company surveys over more than 20 years to draw conclusions about how best to lead for the long term health of an organization. The authors came up with 5 attributes of highly successful companies:

Your company's purpose is its orientation, its north star. It is how you define what your business does and its societal impact. Coulter says: ""you know that's no small thing, to do that really effectively. It takes time to be strategic, and then to make the purpose catalytic, people have to understand its power over decision-making. There are some things you won't do, and some things you'll do differently; that foundational orientation is really critical.""

Your company's plan is the 5-10 year strategy that will give meat to the company's purpose. Following the sustainability framework, the company should set ambitious goals, including science-based targets* on the environmental side where possible, put in place risk management tools, and introduce metrics that help the company keep building toward its targets and creating value for stakeholders.

A company's culture is harder to define and depends quite a bit on human elements: what values did the founders and leaders bring to the company, how do people knit together, what is the human context, and so on. Coulter and his co-authors weren't expecting this aspect to come through so strongly in their surveys, nor its relative importance. ""You could have all these things, a good purpose, and a good plan, but without the culture the operating system doesn't allow the purpose to drive some of the most important elements that we all know: innovation, transparency, engagement. And all those things are connected. The culture allows those aspects to really come to fruition for the organization.,"" says Coulter.

While purpose, plan and culture are foundational aspects of a successful company, collaboration and advocacy are means to bringing leadership to the next level. Collaboration means partnering with different types of organizations, such as governments or nonprofits, suppliers, customers or even competitors, to effect change. Today there are large-scale collaborative projects that help solve societal problems such as deforestation or human trafficking, while bringing bottom-line benefits to the collaborators. Collaboration can also accelerate change in companies as they begin sharing best practices.

More CEOs are speaking out on societal issues, associating their brands with values such as tolerance, diversity and inclusion, and environmental and human rights issues. ""Advocacy has to align with the purpose, with the plan and what you're trying to achieve, so that it's strategic, not just the latest thing you think is important,"" says Coulter. ""It really has to be in line with the systemic change taking place around sustainable development.""

But looking into that future from here isn't easy. ""A lot of the recent scientific reports are disturbing,"" says Coulter. ""We're going in absolutely the wrong directions to have a stable, secure, let alone thriving society and planet. That is the context and that's why we thought the core of this conversation is really about leadership, and how do we help stoke and manifest and define what good leadership looks like going forward.""

He is hopeful that a growing wave of sustainability leadership can guide us safely forward. ""Historically, we went from a 'do no harm' era 20 years ago, to an era of strategic integration of sustainability about 10 years ago, and then now I think we're in a purpose-driven era. Our hope is to move into a regenerative era in the next 5 or 6 years.""",None
"Landing the right internship can be a big boost to your career, because many companies make full-time hiring decisions based on internship performance. Even if you don’t return to the same company where you did your internship, the experience you gain from the internship makes you a more competitive candidate going forward. Even if you don’t like your internship experience, that knowledge helps you better refine what to look for going forward.

January is a busy month for internship recruiting, not just for spring semester placements but even for summer. Many of the top hiring programs (in banking, consulting, big tech, etc.) recruit at the start of the calendar year for internships that won’t begin until June or July. You want to be ready to land an internship now to fully take advantage of the early hiring.

I used to oversee internship hiring for a global media company, and in this role, I hired hundreds of undergraduate and graduate students in various roles in business and creative departments. What made the best candidates stand out? Here are five traits that were often the deciding factors on who got hired:

Enthusiasm and excitement for a role or the company in general goes a long way. One intern, who got placed in marketing for an entertainment division, beat out others who had more relevant experience in that field. This intern had clearly researched the company. He gave clear examples of how the little experience he did have could translate. He regularly followed up with me in HR and others in the businesses he had met along the interview process. He actually didn’t get the first job he applied to, but due to his diligent follow-up and can-do attitude demonstrated in earlier interviews, one of the departments that previously rejected him asked for him directly when a last-minute spot opened up.

Don’t assume that companies know how much you want to work for them. Express your desire in interviews . Follow up diligently. Show a can-do attitude and enthusiasm to work.

Another intern cemented his acceptance into the general summer internship program early because he expressed a lot of flexibility in where he would be placed. Unlike other candidates who only knew about our most famous brands, this intern knew about our niche and specialty products and was just as excited to be placed there as in the popular groups. He was a born-and-raised city kid and ended up getting placed in a product whose demographic was rural and much older. That group was doubly impressed with him, not just because he was a great candidate to begin with, but because they appreciated his flexibility. In turn, his manager and colleagues made sure to give him substantive projects and a lot of mentoring, which put him on the top of the company radar for future work.

Don’t just go after the obvious opportunities and name brands. Many times, a willingness to be flexible and jump into lesser known opportunities can give you an advantage , especially at larger companies where getting in the door in any capacity can lead to more.

While internships are structured for people early in their careers, the best candidates demonstrate relevant experience. This doesn’t mean a lot of experience, in terms of years, but relevant means that you can explain what you accomplished and how this would be helpful to the company. One intern got a double-digit increase over the base hourly rate and a plum placement at the flagship brand. The internship was for a digital initiative, and this intern had worked part-time during the academic year in website development. It was for a very different industry and type of company but her functional experience was relevant, and she demonstrated during her interviews that she knew enough (a lot actually) about our flagship brand so that the company felt very comfortable the lack of direct industry experience didn’t matter.

Don’t assume that your experience is too little to matter. Be prepared to talk about all of your previous roles, and know enough about the company you are targeting so you can draw a clear match between what you have done and what they need.

The digital intern was hired for her past functional experience building websites. Another intern was hired for her unique expertise in communicating highly technical and scientific information to a lay audience. This intern was both a pre-med major and a published writer (for her school and community publications). She targeted divisions that could use that combination of skills and differentiated herself because of her unique expertise and her awareness of how she could contribute to the company. She got placed in a writing role for the science beat of one of the flagship brands.

Think about your unique expertise gained from elective courses, extra-curricular activities, or volunteer leadership roles. Think too about the companies you are targeting and how they can benefit from what you know. Don’t assume your value is obvious – emphasize your expertise in your cover letters and interviews.

While the science writing intern shows that unique expertise is a differentiator, overall business acumen is also a desirable trait. One intern got a highly prized placement in the finance office of a flagship brand, even though his experience to date was in general retail jobs. However, for each of his part-time jobs, he showed a strong grasp of the business dynamics where he worked. For example, one of his jobs was concessions at a movie theater, and he talked about how by the end of his summer there, he could tell if it was a high-revenue day based on what had been selling and what stocks of cups and popcorn containers were dwindling. His attention to detail and understanding of the business environments he worked at impressed the finance group enough that they picked him despite a lack of finance-specific experience.

When you talk about your experience, highlight the skills and insights you have learned. Don’t assume only certain types of jobs are worth listing on your resume or discussing at an interview.",None
"I’m sure you’ve been asked this question countless times throughout your life, and for good reason: “Who's your role model?”

People frequently talk about their role models and describe the journey they’ve taken to follow in their mentors’ footsteps. Advisors, coaches, and teachers have inspired us and taught us how to overcome obstacles. Most importantly, role models can instill key characteristics and values that guide us at home and work.

However, some of the best learning opportunities I’ve experienced have come from having bosses, team members, or friends around me who don’t treat people all that well. I watch and observe how others react to these people and make a constructive lesson of it for myself. Some of you may call them “a-holes,” but I prefer to call them “anti-role models.”

These are the people you swear you’ll never be like, which in turn can affect a positive change in your own life. The self-modification or adjustment you make is because you’re striving to become a better person.

For example, you could have a parent who was an alcoholic and harmful to you. Because of this, you promise yourself that you’ll never have a drink. In the workplace, this toxic person could be the boss who micromanages, belittles employees in front of others, delivers harsh criticism, forces people to work excessively long hours, and commits ethical and legal violations, like sexual harassing employees.

While I definitely wouldn’t want anyone to be subjected to intolerable or abusive bosses, there are definitely lessons you can take away from interactions with these individuals that will make you a better, wiser, and stronger leader.

You learn what not to do or say.

Arguably, when to keep your mouth shut is the most important and influential lesson you’ll learn from an anti-role model. Other noxious examples among the dozens of management no-nos would include:

I’m actually thankful that one of my former bosses helped me grow thicker skin — it’s helped me learn not to take things too personally. Not being at the mercy of my emotions when I’m receiving feedback on my performance is a great benefit.

Now, I actually enjoy perusing the comments sections of my posts, even when the article hasn’t been accurately perceived by someone. Choosing to feel differently kicked up my performance and productivity. Instead of getting offended, I ignore the negative and learn from both constructive and destructive opinions.

You find your own moral compass and voice.

Whether a personal slight is intentional or said in ignorance, you’re not required to do what the person’s asking. This is especially true if the request doesn’t gel with your ethics. Doing what you feel is right helps you find your own moral compass, aids you in speaking up when needed, and allows you to find your own voice.

I should add that just because a boss is bad doesn’t always mean that she’s some nefarious individual. You may even understand her to some extent, especially if she just hasn’t taken the time for any self-scrutiny.

But don’t make these same errors yourself. Kick it up a notch, and reflect on who you really want to be. Maybe she’s poor at clearly explaining directions and outlining what her expectations involve. This boss or teammate may not be great at providing help, direction, or praise.

While frustrating, these examples from each “anti-role model” can be beacons of light to boost your motivation. You’ll have to learn how to hold yourself accountable and find new ways to remain productive when you’re slammed or not feeling it.

Depending on the circumstances, you may not be in a position to give two weeks’ notice every time your boss gets under your skin. Instead of being miserable, you can think about how important resilience is so you can handle these situations like a champ.

As a business owner today, these accounts of negativity could be the most valuable lessons I’ve learned. There are good days and certainly bad days. It’s on the bad days, no matter how much I want to play hooky, that I still show up and give 110 percent.

You learn that you have to overcome your fears.

I strongly believe that the primary reason why bad leaders are well, bad, is that they’re afraid.

They’re afraid to make decisions. They’re afraid of failure and fearful that one of their employees is going to swoop in and take their job. As a result, they may not make rational decisions and may even lash out at employees.

Overcoming your fears is no easy task. But you need to address them and find ways to face them head-on so they don’t consume you and your decisions. I actually embrace fear. For example, instead of being afraid of failure, I look at failure as a learning opportunity so I can grow and not repeat the same mistakes.

It takes a lot of patience to listen to someone who is vague and doesn’t explain things as clearly as you would prefer. You also have to learn how to read between the lines and pick up on his body language.

Again, this may be frustrating, but being a great listener is one of the strongest skills you can possess, both at home and in the workplace.

You get to see how others react to them.

I think this is the most underrated perk of opposite modeling: seeing how other employees react to anti-role models. For example, I’ve noticed that employees become masters at sabotaging the efforts of the boss and, even worse, undermining her success. They also have a knack for finding clever ways to frustrate the boss because they’re not loyal or receptive to her.

You learn how to regulate your emotions.

Working with a lousy boss is definitely agitating, but you can’t fly off the handle or lose your cool. You have to remain calm and maintain your composure. Otherwise, you could face some pretty serious repercussions.

This is another priceless skill that you can apply to both your personal and professional life. When one of my kids or employees makes a mistake, I have to take a deep breath and remain calm instead of freaking out. The loss of employee productivity and trust isn’t worth the momentary emotional release for me.

You take the good with the bad.

Just because you have a bad boss doesn’t mean that she doesn’t have any good qualities. For example, she may not have strong communication skills, but she could have a wealth of industry knowledge. Her ability is something you can learn from and gain experience with. Absorb the information she possesses to help develop your own authority in your industry.

Conduct and style can change; in the meantime, don’t allow bad behavior to make you hesitate to observe the good qualities and skills that your boss has and to model those, too.

While working with bad bosses or leaders isn’t ideal, there are ways to make the most of the situation. In fact, they can have a positive influence on your life and career, simply by teaching you what not to do. Along the way, you can find your own management style and develop essential skills that will make you a strong and competent leader",None
"Here are five things in technology that happened this past week and how they affect your business. Did you miss them?

1 — New Evernote CEO vows to spend 2019 fixing note-taking app’s long list of problems.

The CEO of Evernote, Ian Small, says that he’s committed to fixing a long list of problems with the note-taking app this year. In 2018, the company cut 15 percent of its staff and lost many top executives as a result of these issues, but now Small says he promises to create a “more coherent, more consistent Evernote experience for every version of the product we ship.” He’ll focus on restructuring the way the company designs and delivers software updates and on overhauling the core infrastructure that powers the app. (Source: Venture Beat)

Why this is important for your business:

This story came at an opportune time for me because I’ve been recently thinking of moving away from Evernote at my company to another group note-taking application. I’ve been getting complaints of poor performance, glitches and an outdated interface. Given Small’s promises above, though, I’m going to stick it out for another few months and hope to see enough fixes to make me a fan again.

Newark, New Jersey–based small business lending software provider LendingFront has announced it raised a $4 million, Series A funding round to help modernize small business lending with a cloud lending software program. The company says it will use the funding to provide banks and financial institutions access to LendingFront’s underwriting and SMB credit technology under its end-to-end white label software platform and also to expand the company’s sales, marketing and engineering teams.

Why this is important for your business:

Companies like LendingFront are using cloud based technologies to speed up the approval and the administrative process of loan management for its banking customers. If you’re a business owner, just know that this technology exists, is common and is growing in use among financial institutions who make it a priority to provide fast service while keeping costs down. If your bank is still awash in paper and operating like it’s the 1990’s it may be time to reconsider your long term financial relationship with them.

3 — New features for Microsoft Teams chat app further company’s push to woo retail and service workers.

In an effort to become the tech provider of choice for first-line workers in industries such as retail, hospitality and manufacturing, Microsoft is offering a set of new features for its collaboration app, Teams. The features, which build on a capability unveiled in 2018 that lets employees manage and swap schedules, are designed to help workers better communicate with each other and to allow companies to manage access to important information and give feedback. (Source: Geek Wire)

Why this is important for your business:

The features will include a better and more customizable mobile interface that will have location sharing, a smart camera and the ability to record and share audio messages as well as templates, APIs and a feature called ""Praise"" which will allow employees to give each other shout-outs.  If this is the kind of stuff that interests you - and it should - then it may be worthwhile to take a harder look at Microsoft Teams.  Particularly if you already own Office!

4 — The Lapscreen is a paper-thin 12.5-inch USB-C monitor you can take anywhere.

At CES 2019, a new USB-C monitor called Lapscreen was introduced. Just 8mm thick and measuring 11.1 by 8.3, it can run entirely off a single cable plugged into the user’s phone or laptop. (Source: The Verge)

Why this is important for your business:

A very cool product for the business traveler.  It is nearly as thin as a few sheets of paper stacked together, and the chin at the bottom, which houses the ports and components, is also incredibly slim. The display is a standard 1080p panel—an ultralight extra display that users can literally stick in a folder or laptop case. Unfortunately, though, the Lapscreen has no option for a built-in stand on the back.

5 — Apple cuts 1Q production for new iPhones by 10 pct.

Citing China’s slowing economy as the reason for weaker iPhone sales, Apple has reduced production for its three new iPhone models by about 10 percent for the January-March quarter, according to the Nikkei Asian Review. China, of course, has been impacted by a trade war with the United States. In late December, Apple asked its suppliers to produce fewer-than-planned units of its XS, XS Max and XR models. In addition, higher prices for the new iPhones have been a concern for analysts and consumers. (Source: Fox Business)

Why this is important for your business:

Do you think it’s just China?  Hmmm. No knock on Apple and its fantastic iPhone, but my company uses Android-based smartphones and tablets because they’re less expensive, more flexible and do pretty much the same things as Apple products.  I think the popularity of iPhone competitors is a big reason why iPhone orders have fell and I expect to see this trend continue for the foreseeable future.

"The more you think about advancing your career in traditional ways, the greater you lessen your chances of achieving that goal. Contrary to popular opinion, determining whether you fit a written job description isn't how to align yourself with your next big role.

That’s because many job descriptions and requisite skills are exhaustive lists, and you may only have some of the skills or lack in-depth experience. The requisite skill set is so diverse, it can appear intimidating, and as a potentially successful candidate, you may be too afraid to apply.

I'm going to show you how to approach this quite differently. The goal is to present yourself with a currency that convinces the hiring manager that you are the best candidate for the role.

You need to start with the basic premise of deservedness. If you are unsure of yourself or have doubt, you will show up to the interview with an inherent lack of confidence. This will undermine your ability to sell yourself and prove that you are the very best candidate for the job.

This deservedness is the foundation for everything else to follow. You need to believe that you have a seat at the table because you have earned it. Advancing further is based on a combination of your achievements and potential to accomplish greater things. As you present for a promotion or a project with a larger scope, this positive attitude must ring true.

Confidence is critical to landing the job. But keep in mind it's different from arrogance. Arrogance suggests you are better than anyone else. When you portray confidence, you showcase your belief in your ability to do the job. If you are unsure or present with self-doubt, you can't expect others to take a bet on you. When you believe in yourself, you instill confidence in others.

The third ingredient to advancing your career is applying for jobs that you are not necessarily fully qualified for. This means that you only partially fit the job description. The goal is to show the hiring manager that your skills are transferable. For example, explain how you have led a complex project and created necessary alignment among diverse stakeholders. This has less to do with your technical skills and everything to do with your leadership.

We know that when leaders derail, much of the time it isn't due to a lack of technical skills, but interpersonal skills and emotional intelligence.

Most successful leaders will tell you they raised their hands for jobs they were never fully qualified for and were far from the obvious choice. It was their conviction and passion that convinced the selection committee that they were indeed qualified.

Show how elements of your previous roles are transferable to this new job. Explain that your ability to execute, motivate others, build partnerships and be innovative has been vital to your success to date. Demonstrate that your ability to achieve has not been a one-off or due to someone else's random act of kindness.

Owning your success means that your capabilities will position you for your next challenge. Savvy leaders know they are not just smart or talented based on one project or one moment in time. Your talent prevails across different initiatives. When you position yourself this way, you will successfully compete for that stretch role. When you believe it's yours, your enthusiasm and conviction illustrate to others why the job should be yours.

Stand tall, own the space and believe you are equally if not more qualified than the other candidates. Superstars stand out because they believe in three things: (1) themselves, (2) the power of their team and (3) the strategy and growth potential of their organization.

Rising to the challenge means moving down from the bleachers. Seize a front-row seat not as an observer but as a qualified owner with a vested vision. Then, and only then, will those in positions of power pay you the right kind of attention and sponsor your rise to greater prominence.",None
"The strength of a nonprofit is linked to the strength of its board of directors. This may seem like conventional wisdom, but during my time in the nonprofit sector, I’ve seen many organizations struggle because their boards of directors are disengaged or not composed of the leaders needed to drive the mission forward.

There are several reasons why boards may not be as strong as they could be. These range from a lack of understanding around the roles and responsibilities associated with a board by both the board members and staff leadership to staff who are reluctant to challenge the status quo for fear of offending or alienating board members.

To promote organizational success, it is imperative to find ways to ensure a nonprofit’s board of directors is as strong as it can be. Here are three tips for making that happen:

1. Engage The Right People For The Job

Bringing experienced individuals with specific expertise on to your board is important, but they also need to be able to bring resources to the organization. Boards are sometimes composed of well-meaning people whose hearts are in the right place, but who don’t have the financial means or access to financial resources through their professional or personal networks to support the organization.

If your board is unable, or worse, unwilling to invest in your organization, how do you explain to a potential external prospect why they should donate to your cause when those closest to your mission can’t or won’t?

When approaching a prospective board member, it’s important to explain the expectation of “giving or getting” financial resources for the organization as part of their commitment. Most people understand that when they are being approached to join a nonprofit board of directors that finding funding is part of the responsibility. If you are having discussions with individuals who can’t commit to financial support in one form or another, it’s probably best that they not be on your board.

It’s very easy to get into the habit of staff running board meetings and board members essentially becoming spectators. That’s a big mistake because it eventually leads to the board becoming disengaged from the organization and feeling little to no responsibility for decisions or the organization’s well-being.

Board members should be given the opportunity to “own” board meetings through the creation of committees with specific responsibilities and deadlines. In this structure, the staff can set schedules for committee meetings and calls, work with the committee chairs to set agendas and deadlines, and provide talking points or scripts to support the board chairs.

In the end, though, the committee chairs and members should own the decisions and report out to the broader board at board meetings. This helps reinforce the sense of ownership necessary to get members to actively support and promote the mission.

The board of directors should be focusing on big-picture items, like setting organizational goals and strategies -- not on day-to-day decisions. It’s very easy for board members to drift into conversations around minutiae that staff should be handling on their own as part of their job responsibilities. It’s not a good use of board members’ time to have them debating the design of brochures or which vendor to select to repave the parking lot.

Building a strong board of directors is not an easy task. It involves difficult conversations and a commitment from senior staff to push back, respectfully and diplomatically, when required. However, success begets success, and over time, the board members themselves will help drive the process of board strengthening. It takes time, but in the end, it is well worth the investment.",None
"At a time when artificial intelligence and automation are becoming widespread in the workplace, and companies need to respond with greater agility to changing environments, it is vital that organizations have effective structures in place to optimize processes. Since the backbone of a successful business is the talent of the company business leaders need to ensure they are providing a healthy work environment to attract and retain the best possible employees.

Traditionally, most companies have been structured around rigid hierarchies, with junior employees reporting to managers and managers to department heads, and so on. However, as the way we work transforms, these structures are being questioned. Some businesses are beginning to remove layers of management completely so that decision-making becomes more autonomous and they can react swiftly to market changes.

Businesses that are looking for talent to drive strategy will look very different to the hierarchical organizations of the past, weighed down with many layers of ineffectual managers. For example, companies where employees can decide for themselves which team to join, or which project they’d like to own, would empower them to work harder and innovate; all outcomes which would benefit the business.

Instead of assigning roles and responsibilities around an organized hierarchy, business leaders should instead look to empower teams to define their own goals. By doing so, they can grow themselves fluidly in a direction guided by senior leadership in ways that take advantage of the strengths of the organization and its workers.

If someone has too many people reporting to them, or if the business needs more technical expertise, for example, it’s more efficient to split a role into two or to look for expertise outside of the organization. This allows businesses to remain efficient and effective without adding unnecessary management layers which often serve to slow down processes and reduce efficiency.

It’s also important for business leaders to be willing to use talent outside of the company. That way, the organization can benefit from better expertise or more technical advice. Low-cost developers, for example, might be better found outside of Europe, and in many cases may be more suitable for the task in hand. Consequently, it is crucial for businesses to invest in external and not just internal talent.

Businesses leaders should also look to create a more open culture where ideas can be shared at all levels, and flexible and remote working encouraged. This kind of collaborative culture means individual employees have more control over their tasks and roles within an organization and will therefore feel more empowered to work away from the office where necessary. Businesses can benefit from hiring a broader range of talent as working hours can be adapted to suit the individual.

With such a variety of collaborative flexible working technologies now available allowing employees to connect with one another at any time and in any place, good business leaders will onboard such new tools that encourage worker connectivity. These technologies improve communication between workers and create an environment of collaboration, also encouraging employees to work together beyond usual hierarchies.

The physical layout of workplaces should also be redesigned to support a shift to a less hierarchical model. Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, for example, famously works in an open-plan office in close proximity to more junior colleagues. Businesses would therefore benefit from setting out workstations in groups to encourage stronger team interaction and communication across levels of previously established hierarchy.

Ultimately, in order to stay efficient and maximize company growth and development, business leaders need to move towards flatter, less hierarchical business models that allow workers to be more fluid within their roles. This will allow organizations to foster more inclusive environments, creating environments that retain talent and help attract new workers that will ultimately contribute to further building and developing the business.",None
"The current U.S. government shutdown is entering its 23rd day and on Saturday it set a new record for the longest shutdown in U.S. history. It all started when President Trump refused to approve a budget unless it included $5.7 billion to fund a wall along the border with Mexico, one of his key pledges on the campaign trail. Democrats are bitterly opposed to his plan and they claim it would not solve the country's immigration issues. Both sides have been deadlocked since with around 800,000 federal workers caught in the middle. Under normal circumstances, most of them would have been paid on Friday but they have now missed their paycheck.

The U.S. has had plenty of shutdowns since the mid-1970s and previously, the longest one on record occurred between the end of 1995 and start of 1996 under President Clinton. That was due to a disagreement between Clinton and Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich over federal spending levels. Along with its unusual length, that shutdown was highly notable for kickstarting a new era of sharp bipartisanship, gridlock and political infighting that have gained traction over the years and contributed to the current record-breaking impasse.

According to a Washington-Post-ABC News poll released on Sunday, 53% of Americans say that the president and GOP should shoulder blame for the shutdown while 29 percent are pointing the finger at Democrats in Congress. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham urged Trump to temporarily reopen parts of the government for several weeks to facilitate negotiations to permanently end the shutdown. Despite that, a solution to the deadlock still seems a long way off.",None
"Former Notre Dame Coach Lou Holtz carried three rules to every team he coached: Do what's right. Do your best. Treat others as you would like to be treated. To him, these simple rules would help carry an individual or a team to their highest potential.

Your life as an entrepreneur certainly has its ups and downs. Every day, fear and financial stress can create anxious moments and difficult choices. In these moments, ""doing what's right"" must be foundational to you.

But what is the ""right thing"" to do, especially in the eyes of your employees, customers and key partners?

In my work as a strategic advisor and coach, I have seen entrepreneurs who believe they are forced to make short-term decisions — decisions that may go against their moral compass. Most of the time, these decisions are based on short-term financial need. One compromised decision leads to another, and they begin to stack up on each other.

While this may seem like the only path for you as an entrepreneur, you are only setting your organization up for failure in the long term. You may not see it until it's too late.

To do what's right, having a strong moral compass is critical.

Hope can be a powerful motivator. As an entrepreneur, you must keep your dream big and in front of you every day. Too often, CEOs and entrepreneurs get caught up in the inertia, the day-to-day grind that puts you in a rut.

I have seen entrepreneurs who never give up, no matter what. A client of mine once entered an emerging market too early — perhaps five years too early. However, they always talked about the big dream, and today, this emerging company is poised for a significant increase in value.

Now, dreaming big doesn't mean you should ignore the facts. You must get up every day and focus on the strategic, important and urgent.

The best way to dream big is to schedule dedicated time each week to accomplishing a task that gets you one step closer to that dream. Treat it as one of the most important events on your calendar. Write down the big dream, followed by the brutal facts that your business is currently facing. With each brutal fact, create one corresponding big-action item.

It takes time to dream big, but as they say, you get what you focus on. Dreaming big can be, in a sense, magical. It keeps you and your employees inspired.

Successful entrepreneurs will tell you that their path wasn't a straight line up. More than likely, their journey was filled with a few bumps and bruises.

I love to hear podcasts or stories of former Navy Seals who made it through one of the most difficult training regimens. A consistent theme with the Seal stories is mindset. Not only do the physically strong survive, but more importantly, the mentally strong. Navy Seals have more than positive thinking; they have a dedicated ability to focus and train their minds.

In business, every day is an obstacle course, especially when dealing with employees, customers, vendors and key partners. Cash flow may get tight. Products may fail. Service components may not meet your standard. But during those times when you feel defeated, look up to your big dream, and take time to refocus your mindset. Those who train their minds and do it again and again have a better chance of never giving in or up.",None
"What others think of us is a natural concern for almost all of us. And for good reason! Other people’s opinions often lead to pro-social behaviors such as reciprocity of kind gestures or the urge to make amends when we’re in the wrong. It’s what keeps us moral and makes for a fair and just society.

However, any virtue can turn into a vice when taken to an extreme. When we stop listening to our own opinions in favor of what other people may think, we become disconnected from our values, our aspirations and from the difference we can each make in the world. We become hooked onto approval and a constant need for validation, we avoid situations that can lead to disagreement, and we fall apart with even the most subtle sign of criticism.

This dependence on other people to feel good about ourselves keeps many high-achieving women stuck in jobs that have become too small for their capabilities. Despite their competence, they fear speaking up and sharing their ideas—and watch in regret as others claim them. Despite being the best person for a more senior role, they avoid putting themselves forward, and get frustrated when more junior colleagues get the job. They hide behind their achievements, expecting these to speak for themselves, and get upset when they’re not valued nor rewarded the way they know they should be.

I have spent years researching why competent and otherwise confident-looking women struggle to take the steps that will help them advance professionally despite knowing why it’s important and how to do so. The answer lies in the psychological construct of “fragile” confidence where their competence and apparent confidence is underpinned by low self-worth. However, the feelings of unworthiness are often inaccessible to logic and reason because they emerged at a time when the brain had yet to develop a cognitive system capable of making sense of their experiences. For high-achieving women, who have had a lifetime of successes and approval, this may be even more so.

As a result, many women are driven by a subconscious fear of rejection that forces them to engage in behaviors that keep them stuck. In their latest book How Women Rise: Break the 12 Habits Holding You Back from Your Next Raise, Promotion, or Job, leadership expert Sally Helgesen and leadership coach Marshall Goldsmith identify three habits in particular that relate to this fear. In their combined 60 years of experience, they have found that women tend to overvalue expertise, become trapped in perfection and put their job before their career, becoming indispensable in their roles and thus stalling their career advancement.

For the millions of women who feel stuck at middle management, and for the countless organizations that are frustrated by the lack of visible change despite the time, money and effort invested in women’s leadership development, here’s an undeniable truth of the human psyche: our subconscious minds drive our behaviors.

To move past the proverbial glass ceiling and rise to the top while lifting those below them, women need more than skills and strategies. They also need to build an authentic sense of self-worth so they do not cut the rungs off the ladder that gets them to the top—if they’re able to actually get there.

Based on the framework of Authentic Confidence that I have developed and tested in randomized controlled trials and in my work as a women’s leadership coach, I propose two things in particular that women can focus on:

The journey for women past the early stages of their careers is challenging at best. There is the double bind of competence and likeability based on subconscious biases. There is the double burden of motherhood and management given that both work and relationships are important sources of meaning in women’s lives. To manage these swampy waters without getting sucked in by them, it’s essential for women to be deeply connected with their values and with their vision of a fulfilled life. Research shows that unless individuals internalize the behaviors they need to engage in as being important to them, their motivation will wane with challenges, or lead to burnout in a futile attempt to prove their worth through their successes.

Workplaces reward success and discourage failure. For women who depend on approval to preserve their sense of self, it magnifies their dependence on outcomes and keeps them stuck in behaviors that signify competence and maintain their success. However, the research is clear that failure builds mastery, a construct far more critical to success than competence. Mastery allows individuals to take risks even in the face of uncertainty, essential in today’s unpredictable and ambiguous workplaces. Helgesen and Goldsmith have found that when women identify areas they need to work on, and enlist regular feedback from their bosses, they not only build mastery, they also increase their visibility and are rewarded for their efforts.

By grounding themselves in their authentic expression, women can unhook themselves from what others think of them while also respecting and honoring important relationships. Research in developmental psychology shows that this ability to hold a me within a we will help them not only rise to their highest potential, but also embrace a higher consciousness.

"Websites that makes money on ad revenue must strike a balance between getting the most revenue per website visit and keeping the experience enjoyable for users. Everyone has visited a site where they were immediately bombarded with advertisements. Google has been trying many tactics to encourage site owners to use ads responsibly, including adding an automatic ad blocking feature on some versions of Chrome. Google recently announced that they will be extended the ad blocking feature on Chrome worldwide on July 9th.

Advertising has been an essential part of the media landscape for more than a century. Advertising allows publishers to reduce the price a customer needs to pay to access content, if not eliminate it entirely. This is why advertising funds much of the modern web, it allows content creators to make money from content that's available for free. However, pushing the envelope by oversaturating a page with ads lessens the experience for users and can damage the entire online advertising paradigm.

After years of increases to the numbers of ads seen on websites, many people began using ad blockers to prevent all ads from being displayed. After several less-than-successful attempts to convince users to not use ad blockers, Google adopted a tactic to convince website owners to improve the ad experience for users. Since last year, sites in western markets that have an abusive ad experience have had their ads blocked by Google Chrome. This may not help with people who are already using ad blockers, but it can reduce the number of new people who are opting out of the ad experience entirely.

Google has reported that the online advertising landscape changed once content creators realized that their sites were being penalized for having abusive ad experiences. According to Google, ""In the U.S., Canada, and Europe, website owners have successfully been able to make changes to the ads on their sites. As of January 1, 2019, two thirds of all publishers who were at one time non-compliant to the Better Ads Standards are now in good standing.""

Though Google is using its considerable weight to force better advertising principles, they aren't making up the rules on their own. Google's ad blocking is based on abusive ad practices built on the definitions in the Better Ads Standards from the Coalition for Better Ads. The Coalition for Better Ads is comprised of online media organizations and trade organizations that seek ""to improve consumers' experience with online advertising"".

The coalition was originally limited to mostly North America and Europe, but they are expanding its operations globally. As the group explained on their website, ""The Standards for North America and Europe were published in March 2017 and have been applied by many industry participants in their business practices. The Coalition announced in January 2019 that its research supports the adoption of the same Standards worldwide for desktop and mobile web.""

The July 9th date gives website owners a hard deadline for when they need to have their site's improved. Google has an Ad Experience Report tool that helps publishers know if Chrome has identified any violating ad experiences on their site. This tool was only available in certain areas, but is now available globally. Once a site identifies sections of their site that have too many or improper ads, they need to make adjustments and test the pages again until they are good by the standard Google uses.

Often, website owners and marketers aren't too pleased when Google forces a paradigm shift, but it's normally for the best. People weren't happy when Google demanded all sites be mobile responsive or when they made HTTPS a ranking factor. However, these changes made the internet better for everyone and it's likely to be the same here. Improving the ad experience will make people less likely to use ad blockers that punish all sites for the abusive ad policies of some sites.

It could be said that Sontag uses the term 'subcultural theory' to denote a mythopoetical reality. The main theme of the works of Gibson is not narrative as such, but subnarrative.

Therefore, the premise of postsemanticist discourse suggests that society has objective value, but only if modernist deconceptualism is invalid; if that is not the case, Lacan's model of dialectic theory is one of ""the precultural paradigm of expression"", and hence intrinsically unattainable.",None
